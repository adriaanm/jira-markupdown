Related to SI-4728. This compiles, the second alternative is chosen
{code:scala}
object t {
  def f(x: Object) = 1
  def f(x: String*) = 2
}
t.f("") // returns 2, should be ambiguous.
{code}

According to SI-4728, it should be ambiguous. I assume the compiler thinks that {{String*}} conforms to {{Object}}. Maybe because it tests if {{Seq[String]}} conforms to {{Object}}, not sure.
I think SI-8342 will say that autotupling makes the first f applicable to arbitrary strings. There's an issue somewhere with the example with a type parameter.

Right, I forgot about that. Auto-tupling seems just wrong in too many situations.
{code:scala}
scala> def f(x: Object) = 0
f: (x: Object)Int

scala> f(1,2,3)
res0: Int = 0
{code}
Is this open because it's still unambiguous under -Yno-adapted-args?  If that should matter? Asking for a friend.
