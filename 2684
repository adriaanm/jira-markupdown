#2540 was closed but this doesn't seem to be addressed; there's still no 'withFilter' on Iterator.

Perhaps I'm not clear on the intentions behind withFilter, but it seems that using a for comphrehension guard with an Iterator should either

- Work without a deprecation error
- Not work at all

Obvious preference for the former.

At the moment, withFilter is commented out in Iterator.scala, with this comment
```scala
/** !!! Temporary, awaiting more general implementation.
  *  ... better wait longer, this fails once flatMap gets in the mix.
  */
// def withFilter(p: A => Boolean) = this.toStream withFilter p
```
