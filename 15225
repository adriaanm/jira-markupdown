Create a new Scala Project an replace the main code (in com.testscala package) with:
```scala
1  package com.testscala
2   class ScalaClass(x: Int) {
3     val xx = x
4     val yy = xx + x
5     val zz = xx + yy + x
6   }
7
8   object Main {
9     def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {  
10      val a = new ScalaClass(5)
11      println(a.zz)
12    } 
12  }
```
Set a breakpoint at line 3 and run in debug mode. When the program stops at line 3, place (hover) the cursor over the "x". It should show the value "5", but shows "x: Int". 

Step to the next line (F6).  Current line is 5. Hover over the "xx" shows "yy=0" (should show "xx=5").

Step to the next line (F6). The current line goes to line 4 (shouldn't be line 6?). Two F6 more and the current line is line 6.
Hover over the "x" (shows "x: Int"). Hover over the "y" (shows "y: Int"). Hover over the "xx" (shows "zz=0").


The "Variables" view shows all variables correctly all time.
