I do not think that is corrupt. One might say that carriage return character should not allow overwriting the content, but I guess that is how consoles work. The first two characters of the [^mytext_repro5.txt] file are a carriage return and a new line character. The scala streams are eager in their first element, but lazy in their second, so only the first character - carriage return - is read. That character moves the cursor to the beginning of the line ({{f: Seq\[Char\] = Stream(}}) and from that the printing continues, overwriting the first four characters ({{f: S}}) with `, ?)`, resulting in the output you described: `, ?)eq\[Char\] = Stream(`.

What is your expected output for such input? (In the `toString()` method of the Streams - as you also realized -, the first value is the eagerly consumed value, the `?` represents the not yet read parts.)
