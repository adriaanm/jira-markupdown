Can we avoid generating "V" specializations in parameter positions? I acknowledge this may be necessary for reasons which my grasp of the possibilities does not make me aware of.  However, consider the substantial impact this small sounding change has.
```scala
final class Foo[@specialized T1, @specialized T2, @specialized R](f: (T1, T2) => R) { }
```
Right now that generates 10*10*10 = 1000 extra classfiles.  If it skipped Unit for T1 and T2, which are completely useless because Unit erases to BoxedUnit and T1 and T2 are already specialized on AnyRef, then it would generate 9*9*10 = 810 classfiles, a 19% reduction.  Or flipped around, we're eating an almost 25% size gain for nothing.

One can of course enumerate the types (or make one of my fancy new groups in the Specializable companion) but the point of the ticket is that it would be even better if we didn't have to tell the compiler that we don't need 25% more custom code to handle all the incoming Units we intend on processing.
I agree to cutting down on useless specialization. But scanning user code seems too intrusive -- I wouldn't want the compiler to decide not to specialize on a value type because it thought it's not a good idea. To give an example:

```scala
class Foo[@specialized T1, @specialized T2, @specialized R](f: (T1, T2) => R) {
  val inverse: R => (T1, T2) = ???
}
```

Would you avoid specializing R to Unit in the above class, because it's an argument in a publicly accessible value? What about Foo[Int, Int, Unit]? I would rather issue a warning, but still specialize.
The compiler can see R being used in all positions in that class.  The cases I am after are those where it is not.  The most obvious examples involve type parameters with variance; assuming external visibility, contravariant parameters will not be return types and covariant parameters will not be parameter types, by definition.
I am in favor of warning, but strongly against taking action. Testing equality on unrelated types is a similar issue: we warn that it's probably wrong, but the programmer knows better, so ultimately we generate the bytecode. 

The same principle applies for specialization: if the programmer agrees it's wrong, he can correct the specialization parameters. In the near future we'll have smarter expressions for selecting specialized types, so selection awkwardness will be a non-issue. Shameless plug: Have you seen the Selective Specialization section of [the SIP|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWm3l4TUmiB_7BzjduuXLZbBcmPBKZbLLbhxGbh3OWM/edit]?
