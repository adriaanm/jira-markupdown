According to SLS 6.19 the production for generators is,
{code}
Pattern1 '<-' Expr [Guard]
{code}

Pattern1 includes type patterns, so the following ought to compile,
{code}
val a : Any = "foo"
for (s : String <- Some(a)) yield s
{code}

and behave similarly to,
{code}
val a : Any = "foo"
Some(a) match { case Some(s : String) => Some(s) ; case _ => None }
{code}

However the for comprehension gives the following error at compile time,
{code}
scala> val a : Any = "foo"
a: Any = foo

scala> for(s : String <- Some(a)) yield s
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (String) => String
 required: (Any) => ?
       for(s : String <- Some(a)) yield s
           ^
{code}

Duplicate of SI-900, kind of.
Duplicate of SI-1089, all the way.  I'm going to consolidate all three under SI-900 with pointers to these tickets.  I also am looking at implementing this - it shouldn't be too hard but so far I find the code generation in the compiler a little hard to follow.
