According to the announcement of 2.11.0-RC1, I report an issue I have with code that compiles file under 2.10.3 but does not compile under 2.11.0-RC1.

The issue can be reduced to the following minimal case:

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_51).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A extends A
class A {
  private var a: Boolean = false 
  def run { A.a = true }
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined module A
defined class A

scala>
{code}

The same code fails to compile with Scala 2.11.0-RC1

{code}

         def run { A.a = true }

Thanks a lot or reporting.

As weird as this seems, it is actually according to the Spec. 

Private fields are not inherited. So you can't select them from a value of the derived type. 

You can upcast and select the member, however.

{code}
object A extends A
class A {
  private var a: Boolean = false
  def run { (A: A).a = true }
}
{code}

This was changed under SI-7475. We double checked with Martin, and with the behaviour of Javac, which does the same thing. (Java doesn't have companions, but you can emulate the same thing with nested classes)
I'm adding a paragraph to the release notes with the example from SI-8371, which is the smallest I've seen so far.
