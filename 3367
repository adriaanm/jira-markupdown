This is by now fixed. You now get
```scala
t2998.scala:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.mutable.GenericArray[A.this.T]
 required: Array[A.this.T]
    m(a.map((t:T)=>t))
           ^
one error found
```
The error message is admittedly opaque, but what it says is that map could not produce a new Array (because of a missing manifest), so it picked a GenericArray as the next best option.
