Downgrading to major and scheduling for Scala 2.12.

The underlying issue is that we are conflate compiler's runtime classpath and compilation classpath. To properly split the two we'll need to refactor our classpath handling code. This is a task for Scala 2.12.

For Scala 2.11, we should mention this issue in release notes and offer work-around: the {{-nobootcp}} option.
