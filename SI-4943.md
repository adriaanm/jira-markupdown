Generate scaladoc. Remove all images in lib/.
Previously, the html alone was almost usable. With the new layout, it is harder to use. (the search box is not visible at all, the buttons are not visible, etc...)

I attached two screenshots, with the old layout and the new one.
(heathermiller in [r25615|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25615]) Improves the usability of Scaladoc when images are not available. Closes SI-4943.
