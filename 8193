Update on this after digging around a bit.

The following seems to happen. 

In the case of `col.map(new OtherFunc)`, the expected type of `map` is `MyFunc[Int,?\]`. Meanwhile, the type parameters of `OtherFunc` are inferred independently of the implicit conversion to be `OtherFunc[Any, Nothing\]`.

In the case of `col.map(_.toString)`, the expected type of `map` is also `MyFunc[Int,?\]`.
However, in this case, implicit search seems to try to find a conversion from `Function1[<error>,<error>\]` to the above expected type.

-Ydebug -Ylog:typer output for the {{col.map(_.toString)}} case:
```scala
[log typer] inferring view from scala.this.Function1[<error>,<error>] to <empty>.this.MyFunc[scala.this.Int,?]
[log typer] infer view from scala.this.Function1[<error>,<error>] to <empty>.this.MyFunc[scala.this.Int,?]
```

In both cases, implicit search does not have an influence on inferring the type of the argument of `map`. This doesn't seem to be spec'd, but I agree that this would be very nice to have.
