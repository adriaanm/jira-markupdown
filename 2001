Hi everyone, I'm quite a newbie regarding scala but I've encountered the same problem with an obfuscated jar.

I use a library from an external company which is obfuscated (Qoppa JPDFProcess) and even if I don't directly access any of the obfuscated classes scalac still complains about a package and an object with the same name.

{code}
(fragment of pdf_preflight.scala):1: error: package pdfViewer contains object and package with same name: a
one of them needs to be removed from classpath
val p = new com.qoppa.pdfProcess.PDFDocument.PDFDocument()
{code}

So is there anything I can do? The jar works perfectly with javac. If I can help in any way I would like to, but I have no experience in compilers and such things.

And I hope its ok to hijack this bug.
