The docs of BigDecimal say the following:

"Within the range of IEEE binary128 numbers, BigDecimal will agree with BigInt for both equality and hash codes (and will agree with primitive types as well)."

In some cases in Scala 2.11 this does not appear to be the case. The following example shows this regressing from 2.10 to 2.11:

2.10
{code}
scala> BigDecimal(123.312).hashCode()
res0: Int  -1903704720

scala> (123.312).##
res1: Int = -1903704720
{code}

2.11
{code}
scala> BigDecimal(123.312).hashCode()
res0: Int = 342240935

scala> (123.312).##
res1: Int = -1903704720
{code}

It might be that this was simply dropped as a feature of BigDecimal. That would break some applications and it would be good to update the docs at least with a warning.
[~ichoran] This changed in your BigDecimal consistency patch, https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/29541ce3

{code}
% scala-hash 29541ce3~1 -nc -e 'println(BigDecimal(123.312).hashCode())'
-1903704720
% scala-hash 29541ce3 -nc -e 'println(BigDecimal(123.312).hashCode())'
342240935
{code}

Intentional? Unavoidable?
Ugh.  I'd forgotten about hash codes.  Floating-point is such a pain.

{code}
scala> new java.math.BigDecimal(123.312)
res0: java.math.BigDecimal = 123.3119999999999976125764078460633754730224609375
{code}

So, that's not actually 123.312, is it?  But my patch tried to make BigDecimal(123.312) be exactly 123.312 (i.e. the decimal fractional value, not the Double approximation), since there were a lot of consistency gotchas around BigDecimal/Double interconversion.

I'll see if it's practical to fix isValidDouble or hashCode to agree with the string representation of the Double, not the actual value.  I think I just forgot to switch this out for equivalentToDouble.
Just needed {{isDecimalDouble}} instead of {{isValidDouble}}.  Junit test added.
