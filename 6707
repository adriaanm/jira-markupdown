That's according to the spec AFAIK. From chapter 1 Lexical Syntax:

To construct tokens, characters are distinguished according to the following classes
(Unicode general category given in parentheses):

1. Whitespace characters. \u0020 | \u0009 | \u000D | \u000A
2. Letters, which include lower case letters(Ll), upper case letters(Lu), titlecase
letters(Lt), other letters(Lo), letter numerals(Nl) and the two characters
\u0024 ‘$’ and \u005F ‘_’, which both count as upper case letters
3. Digits ‘0’ | . . . | ‘9’.
4. Parentheses ‘(’ | ‘)’ | ‘[’ | ‘]’ | ‘{’ | ‘}’.
5. Delimiter characters ‘‘’ | ‘’’ | ‘"’ | ‘.’ | ‘;’ | ‘,’.
6. Operator characters. These consist of all printable ASCII characters
\u0020-\u007F. which are in none of the sets above, mathematical symbols(
Sm) and other symbols(So).

And if you lookup the definition of an identifier in section 1.1, a '.' is not allowed as character in an identifier.
