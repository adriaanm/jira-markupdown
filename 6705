Annoying indeed. I didn't try that when I wrote the Javascript. Try replacing lines 37-40 in template.js with the following:
```Javascript
 $(document).keydown(function(event) {
    if(!event.altKey && !event.ctrlKey &&
       (event.keyCode == 27 || (event.keyCode >= 48 && event.keyCode <= 90)) &&
       document.activeElement != $("#textfilter input")[0]) {
           $("#textfilter input").focus();
    }
});
```

With this the code is far more selective in when to focus the input field. It will only focus it when the user presses Escape, a letter or a digit, but not when CTRL or ALT are also pressed.
