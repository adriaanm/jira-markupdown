Yes--I entered a new issue in order to inspire further discussion.

Why can't there be a four-argument version, in which the fourth argument is the representation of the empty collection?  That would both serve my needs and also retain the semantics of the existing function.  It would be a trivial implementation:

def mkString(begin: String, sep: String, end: String, empty: String) = if (isEmpty) empty else mkString(begin, sep, end)
