The following code gives a classCastException with 2.7.0-RC3
It runs silently with 2.6.0.

```scala
object Test extends Application {

    def f(a: Array[_]) {}

    val zero: BigInt = 0

    f(
        zero
        .toByteArray
        .dropWhile(_ == 0x00)  // java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.Array$$Projection$$$$anon$$1
     )
}
```

This underlying issue may be the same as Ticket #446 
Seems to be a duplicate of #446, no new test for this. Leaving for Martin to decide.
Thanks Sean.
I expect #446 can also be closed, as Array(1,3).takeWhile(_ < 2) now succeeds.
