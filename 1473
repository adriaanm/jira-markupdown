David McIver is right: the current immutable.HashMap is fundamentally broken (immutable data structures should be good for concurrent programs, right? So apart from the exceptions, locking on *every* read operation is, ... well, you name it). I'm working with Phil Bagwell (the original inventor of Hash Array Mapped Tries) on an improved implementation. It will not be part of the first 2.8 beta, but we hope that we can ship it as part of one of the later betas. As a workaround for Scala 2.7, I'd suggest using TreeHashMap when necessary.
