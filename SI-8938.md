When code executed as future throws InterruptedException, future is not completed (neither success or failure). Await.result will block indefinitely if timeout is infinite.

It is quite typical for any concurrent code to throw InterruptedException, for example Thread.sleep() might throw one. It is extremely error prone that this type of exception is swallowed and only indication is ExecutionContext's failure report, by default printed to console.





There is another thing bugging me with this bug.
Why would {{Future.apply}} body throw an {{InterruptedException}} in the first place? Doesn't that mean that the asynchronous code that completes the {{Future}} was blocking? If so, that code, such as {{Thread.sleep}}, should have been wrapped in the {{blocking}} call:

http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/futures-promises.html#blocking

In that case, the {{blocking}} call should be catching the {{InterruptedException}} - if it wraps the exception into something else and rethrows, there is no need to update {{NonFatal}}.
You're right, I (or the reporter) should open a thread on the mailing list. That being said, I'll respond to the comments you've made so far.

Regarding it being a design decision, yes, someone deliberately put the NonFatal filters in place, but it's unclear whether they deliberately intended for Futures to swallow fatal exceptions the way they do. I didn't dig it up before making the PR, but I found the the original commit that added the NonFatal qualifiers everywhere (af8416bb7ff4d6816f416cd0671e26e2cdc653d7):

    Adding NonFatal matching as to not catch anything that should terminate the JVM, also adding EX.reportFailure where it makes sense
{quote}

It seems like the commit description is talking about VirtualMachineErrors, not other types of fatal exceptions. I agree with this concern, and would suggest that the Future should either rethrow them after completing the promise, or avoid catching them at all (and yes, my current PR should be updated with one of those options). For all other Throwables, including the other fatal ones, it looks like the async thread has no reason not to complete the promise with them, thus notifying the caller that there was a failure. The [SIP 14 Exceptions|http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/futures-promises.html#exceptions] section, and the library documentation of Future, still claim that Future will convey fatal exceptions back to the caller, wrapped in an ExecutionException. That's no longer true as of the af8416 commit.

The current documentation for [blocking|http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.concurrent.package] says that it now only is intended to cover external blocking APIs, and that Await.result should be used directly instead. As applied to third party blocking APIs, it also says that it throws InterruptedException if the blocking is interrupted. Although it's clear to me why blocking would be discouraged within Future computations, I'm not yet aware of where the documentation specifically forbids use of sleeping code from within a Future.

Regarding the extra hunks in my PR, everything that's not related to the NonFatal change is there to update the tests to verify the changes that the PR makes. I'll respond in more detail in the line notes.
An important remark about the docs:

No, it says that you should use {{blocking}} to designate code that potentially blocks. It does not matter if the code blocks due to {{Thread.sleep}}, {{Await.result}} or an I/O operation - these are all examples of blocking.

It also says that waiting until a {{Future}} object is complete (to get its value) should be done with {{Await.result}}.
I've opened a [discussion|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/45ianF2rQYQ] on Scala internals about fatal error handling.
> I've opened a discussion on Scala internals about fatal error handling.

Wow, that's a long discussion! It is very insightful too. I'm not sure what the conclusion is. Will this be fixed?

Let me add one more example of why the current behavior is annoying. I do some reflection in a {{Future}} and it may fail with {{NoClassDefFoundError}} if things go wrong. Since {{NoClassDefFoundError}} is not {{NonFatal}}, this does not complete the {{Future}} and the thread waiting for its completion will wait forever. This is a user request for a potentially slow operation. The user will wait hours before deciding that perhaps something is wrong.

The only workaround I see for now is that I have to become an expert at what may cause an exception that is not {{NonFatal}} and be sure to catch all those myself. It would be great if I could override the definition of {{NonFatal}} in my own {{ExecutionContext}} instead.
> What's the problem wrapping the code which does the reflection in a try-catch and repackage the fatal exception for those cases where this is needed?

I don't want anything special to happen for {{NoClassDefFoundError}}. I'd like to have it handled just like {{ArithmeticException}}. The reflection happens deep in the call stack, no way to meaningfully handle it there. And reflection can cause so many different exceptions when things go wrong. The higher layers don't care about the reflection. To them this is the same as a division by zero. "What we wanted to do failed." So why is the {{Future}} not completed with a failure? The JVM has certainly not been destroyed.

Like I said, I could indeed try to track down all the calls where a non-{{NonFatal}} exception can happen and wrap these. But I will not find them all, and I don't want to do this in the first place. If you say Scala's {{Future}} handles a subclass of exceptions nicely, but for a few types, like {{InterruptedException}} and {{NoClassDefFoundError}} I'll have to do it myself, it's like a multiplication operator that works for all numbers except 5 and 7. "You can implement multiplication for those exceptions yourself." Yeah, I guess, but why are you excluding them?

At least that's what it feels like at the moment. But I haven't read through the whole discussion thread yet. I just wanted to ping the bug to see if there is any decision to move in some direction with this. Thanks for any insight!
Sorry, I don't want to swamp this ticket, but I found the example I wanted to show. The {{NoClassDefFoundError}} happens in our own code, so it's our fault. But here's another example where we lost a {{Future}}:

{code}
Exception in thread "DataManager-3" java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: HIVE_CLI_SERVICE_PROTOCOL_V8
        at org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveConnection.<init>(HiveConnection.java:189)
        at org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver.connect(HiveDriver.java:105)
        at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:571)
        at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:233)
        at com.lynxanalytics.biggraph.graph_operations.DBTable.lines(DBImport.scala:52)
{code}

I'm just trying to connect to a database. How would I know to expect a {{NoSuchFieldError}} with {{DriverManager.getConnection}}? I'd much rather just trust {{Future}} that it will propagate any exception as a {{Failure}}.
Daniel,

I think it might be worth it to read the conversation :)


Viktor, I had intended to summarize that conversation a year ago, so as you suggest to Daniel, I've reread it now, and I'd summarize the outcome as follows:

h5. InterruptedException and ThreadDeath
These should be converted to an ExecutionException and propagated to the caller.[\[1\]|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/45ianF2rQYQ/p01xPZ3d8I8J][\[2\]|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/45ianF2rQYQ/p01xPZ3d8I8J].

It is sufficient to complete the promise with the exception to implement that behaviour[\[3\]|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/45ianF2rQYQ/dUDyD69gc6oJ].

h5. ControlThrowables

These should be treated similarly to InterruptedException and ThreadDeath[\[4\]|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/45ianF2rQYQ/6Uief7tOMvwJ]. Completing the promise with them would also be sufficient to result in their being wrapped in an ExecutionException.

h5. VirtualMachineErrors
There was a lot of debate about these, with Scott Carey, Rex Kerr, and I advocating to pass them on to the caller, and you advocating that they shouldn't be caught under any circumstance. The debate was ultimately unresolved, although the two of us would agree that it would be preferable to call sys.exit when VM errors leak out of a Future's execution, instead of the current behaviour.

I think another reasonable alternative would be to make another exception that is similar in meaning to ExecutionError, but that dierives from VirtualMachineError, and use this to unwind the stack on calling threads. If implemented properly, this should also cause applications to exit, but in a way that may be clearer to the user. Either solution would be preferable to the current situation, where programs can simply hang if there's a VirtualMachineError.

h5. LinkageErrors

The discussion around these was incomplete. However, none of the reasoning around VirtualMachineError applies to LinkageErrors: there's no reason to believe that the JVM is compromized after a LinkageError is thrown, so the runtime is perfectly capable of catching these and propagating them to the caller. Additionally, I've carefully reviewed the discussion, and I see that there is an undisputed consense among users that the current behaviour is very confusing and unhelpful. If the current behaviour is undesirable, and there's no outstanding reason to keep the status quo, then I'd conclude that it should change.

I think these errors should be propagated into the Future's result, so the caller can see them, and I see nothing from that conversation to suggest that this isn't a good idea. If it's considered important to avoid wrapping them in a non-fatal exception, they can be wrapped in something like an "ExecutionLinkageError" (similar to what I propose for VirtualMachineErrors), which would make it less likely that the caller catches them without explicitly intending to.
