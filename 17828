scala.concurrent.Future fallbackTo method is documented as returning the failure of the first future if both futures fail, but instead it returns the failure of the second future.  Maybe it should be something like this?
{code}
    def fallbackTo[U >: T](that: Future[U]): Future[U] = {
      val p = Promise[U]()
      onComplete {
        case s @ Success(_) => p complete s
        case f =>  that.onComplete {
          case s @ Success(_) => p complete s
          case _ => p complete f
        }
      }
      p.future
    }
{code}
