```scala
    class Foo
    
    implicit def fromInt[A <% Int](x: A) = new Foo       // #1
    implicit def fromString[A <% String](x: A) = new Foo // #2
    
    0: Foo
```

gives

```
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(0)
 required: this.Foo
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method fromInt of type [A](x: A)(implicit evidence$1: A => Int)this.Foo
 and method fromString of type [A](x: A)(implicit evidence$2: A => String)this.Foo
 are possible conversion functions from Int(0) to this.Foo
0: Foo
^
```

This does not happen 2.11.2.
This works in 2.11 because of the fix for #3346. That's not possible to backport to 2.10.x.
