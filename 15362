Using both, eclipse plugin as well as scala, from today's revision (2.8.0.r22036-b20100526020129).

The valid use of "@ _*" is correctly compiled by scala but fails to be parsed in the eclipse plugin.
Example:
{code}
object RemainingArgs {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {  }
  
  	val aString = "Eclipse plugin cannot not handle this"
  	val Array( who, what @ _* ) = aString split (" ")
  	
}
{code}
