The documentation on ScalaDoc for `TaskSupport` is not adequate. Worse, the `tasksupport` getter/setter is not documented at all.

From my own experience, looking at it, even knowing that it was supposed to help me define custom pools, did little to help me figure out how to use it.

On the other hand, the four lines example on the Parallel Collection Guide answered most of my questions.

Let's update the API docs, and not be shy about reproducing material from the guide.
Pull [875](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/875). It's on master, should I make another one to 2.10.x?
Done at [pull 884](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/884).
