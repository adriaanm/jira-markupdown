The following code warns that the expression will always evaluate to false. The expression promptly proceeds to evaluate to true. 

{code}
scala> val foo = new java.util.HashMap[Int, Int]
foo: java.util.HashMap[Int,Int] = {}

scala> foo.get(0) == null
<console>:6: warning: comparing values of types Int and Null using `==' will always yield false
       foo.get(0) == null
                  ^
res0: Boolean = true
{code}

This needs either fixed semantics or a fixed warning. I'd prefer the latter, as "fixing" the semantics would make Java collections very hard to use correctly on Scala primitives (I was very annoyed by the fact that I couldn't usefully use them on Scala primitives until I discovered the compiler was lying to me)
I disagree.  I would rather fix the semantics.

The HashMap has to be parameterized with a reference type, so
in the hash are java.lang.Integer's, but on the way back, I'm
pretty sure the null is being passed through to {{unboxToInt}}
in scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime:

    public static int unboxToInt(Object i) {
        return i == null ? 0 : ((Integer)i).intValue();
    }

I tested checking out trunk and changing that 0 to 123 and getting
a null returned 123 :)

I think in this case you would want to Scala be smart enough not to
take the Integer back to a primitive int, especially since it's being
compared to a null.

The workaround is to explicitly use java.lang.Integer's, at least for the
hash value:

{code}
scala> val foo = new java.util.HashMap[Int, Integer]
foo: java.util.HashMap[Int,Integer] = {}

scala> foo.get(0) == null
res0: Boolean = true
{code}

As an aside, I don't like the idea of null Int's, nor any of the other
integer, boolean, floating poing types magically being converted to 0's.
I think you just have to be aware of those conversions with nulls.  I
like the idea of having {{unboxToInt}} throwing an exception.
Replying to [comment:2 blair]:

I'm fine with fixing the semantics as long as doing so doesn't block the use case. But fixing the semantics and making a significant number of Java types unusable as a result is a Really Bad Idea.

Sure.

I tried exactly this. It generates a deprecation warning in the compiler.
Fix caused SI-668 and is removed in r14432. Will be reapplied when SI-668 is fixed.
Also

{code}
scala> def f(x: Any) = "" + x
f: (x: Any)String

scala> f(null.asInstanceOf[Int])
res0: String = null

scala> f({ val a = null.asInstanceOf[Int]; a })
res1: String = 0
{code}
