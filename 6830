I've just been pounding my head on this one. The only solution I have found was to define the method directly in SadObject. When I try the fourth bullet I get a completely different error, but my method is a bit different:
```scala
trait SadTrait {
  def buggyMethod(arg1: String, argWithDefault: String = "default") = ...
}

class SadClass extends SadTrait {
  buggyMethod(arg1 = "foo")
}
```

The error is:
```scala
error: not found: value arg1
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
arg1 =
```

Invoking the method without then named arg seems to work.
