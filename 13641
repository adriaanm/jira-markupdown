I was trying the new generics support from Java and ran across what seems like a bug. The scala library was generated from revision 15717.
```scala
javac -cp /home/ijuma/src/scala/dists/latest/lib/scala-library.jar:. Test.java
Test.java:6: cannot access scala.PartialFunction
bad class file: scala/PartialFunction.class(scala:PartialFunction.class)
undeclared type variable: B1
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
    Map<String, String> map = Map.empty();
                                 ^
1 error
```

Test.java:
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable.Map;

public class Test {

  void foo() {
    Map<String, String> map = Map.empty();
  }
}
```

javac -version outputs javac 1.6.0_10-rc. The Eclipse compiler also died horribly when I tried the Test class so it does not seem to me like this is a bug in javac.
