With the attached source file's classes in the classpath, this fails:

```scala
scala> issue.Test1.t
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl
```

(The interpreter has crashed here.)

This succeeds further, but still fails:

```scala
scala> issue.Test2
res0: issue.Test2.type = issue.Test2$$@13dc4d5

scala> issue.Test1.t
res1: issue.Example = issue.Example@1f1a3a8

scala> issue.Test1.t.example
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl
```

More:

```scala
scala> issue.Test1.t.example: issue.ENat
res0: issue.ENat = issue.EZero$$@bd4dc2

scala> issue.Test1.t                    
res1: issue.Example = issue.Example@12620b5

scala> issue.Test1.t.example            
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl
```

Spelling out t's definition works the same as t.  Everything seems to work fine if you uncomment the return type for example in the source.
Nearly forgot:

```scala

```
I have been able to cause similar crashes which seem related to type handling in the REPL. in the REPL both in 2.8.0-final and in the latest 2.9.0 nightly build, though the exceptions in each case look different. I was running the following code in the REPL. Also tested on compiled files - this error doesn't occur there so I assume this is REPL specified.
```scala
case class Gender(rep:String) {
  override def toString = rep
}
case class Male extends Gender("Male")
case class Female extends Gender("Female")
```

In both 2.8.0 and 2.9.0 the output looks like this:

I don't think this (the original submission) is a repl issue, though I'm open to pointers if it is.  I sent an email to scala-internals vaguely referencing this, but I think it's related to the business in #3731.

The case class crash mentioned in comments is gone.
