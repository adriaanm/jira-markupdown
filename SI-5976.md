The following code worked flawlessly on 2.9:

{code}
object japi {
@deprecated("Do not use this directly, use subclasses of this", "2.0")
  class UnitFunctionBridge[-T] extends (T ⇒ BoxedUnit) {
    override final def apply(t: T): BoxedUnit = {
      internal(t)
      BoxedUnit.UNIT
    }
    protected def internal(result: T): Unit = ()
  }
}

abstract class Foreach[-T] extends japi.UnitFunctionBridge[T] {
  override final def internal(t: T): Unit = each(t)

  /**
   * This method will be invoked once when/if a Future that this callback is registered on
   * becomes successfully completed
   */
  @throws(classOf[Throwable])
  def each(result: T): Unit
}
{code}

And then from Java:

{code}
 @Test
  public void mustBeAbleToForeachAFuture() throws Throwable {
    final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
    Promise<String> cf = Futures.promise(system.dispatcher());
    Future<String> f = cf;
    f.foreach(new Foreach<String>() {
      public void each(String future) {
        latch.countDown();
      }
    });

    cf.success("foo");
    assertTrue(latch.await(5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
    assertEquals(Await.result(f, timeout), "foo");
  }
{code}

However, using Scala 2.10-M4 javac spits this in mah face:

{code}
[error] /Users/viktorklang/Documents/workspace/akka/akka/akka-actor-tests/src/test/java/akka/dispatch/JavaFutureTests.java:117: apply$mcLJ$sp(long) in akka.dispatch.japi.UnitFunctionBridge cannot implement apply$mcLJ$sp(long) in scala.Function1; attempting to use incompatible return type

This steps around it... But I think it has a certain kind of smell:

{code}
  @deprecated("Do not use this directly, use subclasses of this", "2.0")
  class UnitFunctionBridge[-T] extends (T ⇒ BoxedUnit) {
    final def apply$mcLJ$sp(l: Long): BoxedUnit = { internal(l.asInstanceOf[T]); BoxedUnit.UNIT }
    final def apply$mcLI$sp(i: Int): BoxedUnit = { internal(i.asInstanceOf[T]); BoxedUnit.UNIT }
    final def apply$mcLF$sp(f: Float): BoxedUnit = { internal(f.asInstanceOf[T]); BoxedUnit.UNIT }
    final def apply$mcLD$sp(d: Double): BoxedUnit = { internal(d.asInstanceOf[T]); BoxedUnit.UNIT }

    override final def apply(t: T): BoxedUnit = { internal(t); BoxedUnit.UNIT }
    protected def internal(result: T): Unit = ()
  }
{code}
If that's supposed to mean me, you are absurdly out of line.  One of us spends half his morning diagnosing the other one's issues, not to mention having put at least a week into it prior to this. It's not like it's my personal bug - it's just one of those very difficult problems nobody else cares to tackle.

Meanwhile the other of us thinks reporting issues via mailing list chatter is good enough, and then when imposed upon to open tickets like everyone else, somehow has the nerve to completely omit the products of said morning's work.  If this is your usual mode of operation, your time must be valuable indeed.

Back to this ticket, I know martin said to open it, but unless someone can show otherwise, this is a duplicate of SI-3452.
As far as I can tell, this is really related to the other ticket. Here is what happens without specialization.

Scala:

{code}
import scala.runtime.BoxedUnit

object japi {
  trait MyFunction[-T, +R] {
    def apply(t: T): R
  }
  
  @deprecated("Do not use this directly, use subclasses of this", "2.0")
  class UnitFunctionBridge[-T] extends MyFunction[T, BoxedUnit] {
    override final def apply(t: T): BoxedUnit = {
      internal(t)
      BoxedUnit.UNIT
    }
    protected def internal(result: T): Unit = ()
  }
}

abstract class Foreach[-T] extends japi.UnitFunctionBridge[T] {
  override final def internal(t: T): Unit = each(t)

  /**
   * This method will be invoked once when/if a Future that this callback is registered on
   * becomes successfully completed
   */
  @throws(classOf[Throwable])
  def each(result: T): Unit
}
{code}


Java:

{code}
public class Test {
    
    public void mustBeAbleToForeachAFuture() throws Throwable {
	new Foreach<String>() {
		public void each(String future) {
		}
	    };
    }
    
}
{code}


Result after running:

{code}

java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Test.main([Ljava.lang.String;)
	at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1622)
	at scala.tools.nsc.util.ScalaClassLoader$class.run(ScalaClassLoader.scala:67)

	at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner.main(MainGenericRunner.scala)
{code}

I would reassign this.
Although I remain convinced this is SI-3452, that particular transcript is less than convincing as supporting evidence: 
{noformat}
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Test.main([Ljava.lang.String;)
{noformat}
Indeed it has no main method.

I'm pretty sure Alex was stricken by a disease I'm pretty familiar with myself, "I'm expecting a particular failure and there it is!" The problem is that the NoSuchMethodError he expected to see (based on my pointing at SI-3452) was not the NoSuchMethodError he actually induced (as his had the more pedestrian cause of omitting the main method.)
// t5976.scala
{code}
import scala.runtime.BoxedUnit

object japi {
@deprecated("Do not use this directly, use subclasses of this", "2.0")
  class UnitFunctionBridge[-T] extends (T ⇒ BoxedUnit) {
    override final def apply(t: T): BoxedUnit = {
      internal(t)
      BoxedUnit.UNIT
    }
    protected def internal(result: T): Unit = ()
  }
}

abstract class Foreach[-T] extends japi.UnitFunctionBridge[T] {
  override final def internal(t: T): Unit = each(t)

  /**
   * This method will be invoked once when/if a Future that this callback is registered on
   * becomes successfully completed
   */
  @throws(classOf[Throwable])
  def each(result: T): Unit
}

class Future[T] { def foreach[U](f: T => U): U = ??? }
{code}

// Test.java
{code}
public class Test {
  public void mustBeAbleToForeachAFuture(Future<String> f) throws Throwable {
    f.foreach(new Foreach<String>() {
      public void each(String future) {
      }
    });
  }
}
{code}
This will suffice for the missing Future, depending on what level of self-containedness you're after.
{code}
class Future[+T](val result: T) {
  def foreach(x: Foreach[T]): Unit = x each result
}
{code}
Change (T ⇒ BoxedUnit) to AbstractFunction1[T, BoxedUnit] and you are good to go on both 2.9.2 and 2.10.x. The complete example:
{code:title=t5976.scala}
import scala.runtime.BoxedUnit
import scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1

object japi {
@deprecated("Do not use this directly, use subclasses of this", "2.0")
  class UnitFunctionBridge[-T] extends AbstractFunction1[T, BoxedUnit] {
    override final def apply(t: T): BoxedUnit = {
      internal(t)
      BoxedUnit.UNIT
    }
    protected def internal(result: T): Unit = ()
  }
}

abstract class Foreach[-T] extends japi.UnitFunctionBridge[T] {
  override final def internal(t: T): Unit = each(t)

  /**
   * This method will be invoked once when/if a Future that this callback is registered on
   * becomes successfully completed
   */
  @throws(classOf[Throwable])
  def each(result: T): Unit
}

class Future[T] { def foreach[U](f: T => U): U = sys.error("foo") }
{code}

and:
{code:title=Test.java}
public class Test {
  public void mustBeAbleToForeachAFuture(Future<String> f) throws Throwable {
    f.foreach(new Foreach<String>() {
      public void each(String future) {
      }
    });
  }
}
{code}

Closing this as Not a bug because I don't believe there's actual bug here and there's an easy work-around present. Maybe we should generate bridge methods in UnitFunctionBridge but I'm not sure.
There are "official regressions" and there are "practical regressions". Our guarantees in this area are slim to nonexistent, and would be fairly meaningless if they existed, but this is not really about java compatibility.  The fact that javac refuses to compile against the generated code should be seen as an independent opinion that there's something inconsistent about the generated code, not as something specific to javac.

I do not think this is a matter of bridges, but of generating the right signatures.  I will point against at SI-3452 if you're looking into this: it is subtle.

Ok, I spent more time on it and we indeed generate wrong signatures for method (that do not agree with generic signatures). I created a separate ticket to track progress on it:
https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6101

It contains truly minimized test-case.

I'll assign both tickets to Alex as this is purely specialization problem.
