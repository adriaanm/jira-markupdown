It's a completely understandable error, especially if ensime compiled and the snippet doesn't - I'm just drawing attention to it because the more reliable the speaker is in general, the longer it is before one questions the input data.  It's not a fair universe if being reliable imposes a greater obligation to be reliable, but indeed it is not a fair universe.
