IMHO the PartialFunction object should receive these two additional members, which are helpful in a number of situations where PartialFunction composition requires a "neutral" element:

{code}
private lazy val emptyPF = new PartialFunction[Any, Any] {
  def isDefinedAt(x: Any) = false
  def apply(x: Any) = throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot apply undefined PartialFunction")
}

def empty[A, B] = emptyPF.asInstanceOf[PartialFunction[A, B]]
{code}
(extempore in [r25578|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25578]) Gave partial function an empty member.  Closes SI-4927, no review.
