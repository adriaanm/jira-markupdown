this is with the stock JUnit 4.5 jar. attachment has everything need to reproduce the bug, including a Makefile


perhaps SI-1029 is related
somebody who knows the ClassfileParser, especially the part about inner classes, should fix this (I couldn't find the problem within reasonable time).

When parsing the annotation ("parseAnnotation"), the method "sigToType" is called with {{Lorg.junit.runners.Suite$$SuiteClasses;}} as "sig"-argument. I don't know if this is the correct way to get to an inner class.
It could also be the code generation who writes an incorrect classfile for A2. implementing A2 in java, the ClassfileParser (compiling A1) works fine:

{code}
A2.java:

@org.junit.runners.Suite.SuiteClasses({}) class A2 { }
{code}
