Behold as the following code deadlocks:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.ops._;

object Blocks extends Application{
  val foo = "foo";
  val willBeFoo = future(foo);
  println(willBeFoo());
}
```

Whereas the following works fine:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.ops._;
object Blocks{
  def main(args : Array[String]) = {
    val foo = "foo";
    val willBeFoo = future(foo);
    println(willBeFoo());
  }
}
```

The reason is that fields of the object are not visible to a new thread until after the construction has finished. This is an inherent problem with the concept of Application. 
Yep, the deadlock is there even without using Application at all. The following will deadlock as well.

```scala
import scala.concurrent.ops._;

object Blocks {
  val foo = "foo";
  val willBeFoo = future(foo);
  println(willBeFoo());
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    Blocks
  }
}
```

Maybe we should document this somewhere. I really don't think we can do much, while keeping the current semantics for object initialization (meaning lazy). We make it a bit easier than Java to shoot yourself in the foot, but the same thing happens if the static initializer of a class waits for some thread that in turn depends on the class being initialized.

So I leave this open until we figure out where this piece of documentation should go. Or maybe someone has a better idea.
