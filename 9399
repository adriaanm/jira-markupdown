Example of "nothing magical":
```scala
val trees = List(q"call.f", "call.g")
val output = q"""
  val v = ..$trees
  doSomethingElse(v)
"""
```

According to your proposal this will translate into
```scala
q"""
  val v = { call.f ; call.g }
  doSomething(v)
"""
```

Then somebody else comes and refactors the original code into:
```scala
val trees = List(q"call.f", q"call.g")
val output = q"doSomethingElse(..$trees)"
```

And suddenly out of nowhere all your tests fail because this will result in a completely different tree:
```scala
q"doSomethingElse(call.f, call.g)"
```

I'm strongly against this magic that changes the semantics from something simple to something convoluted without a good reason.
