As was discussed on the list, Enumeration lacks the advantages of being object oriented, while case classes/objects lack the advantages of being enumeratable. A simple subclass of Enumeration, which I would like to contribute to the standard library, solves this problem. The idea of using reflection to solve the problem of lazy object intialization comes from lift's MetaMapper.

 This only works for
```scala
val enums = new CaseEnum { ... }
```
or
```scala
class Enums extends CaseEnum { ... }
object Enums extends Enums
```
but for
```scala
object Enums extends CaseEnum { ... }
```
you have to reference the members in the body,
e.g.
```scala
A; B; C
```
Example usage:
```scala
val Colors = new CaseEnum {
  sealed abstract class Color extends Case
  object Red extends Color
  object Blue extends Color
}
/*OR*/ object Colors extends CaseEnum {
  sealed abstract class Color extends Case
  object Red extends Color
  object Blue extends Color
  (Red,Blue)
}
Colors.foreach {c=> println("Value "+c+" is mapped to "+Colors.cases(c))}
/* should print
Red is mapped to Red
Blue is mapped to Blue
*/
```
Note that members do not actually have to be case classes or case objects.
Also, I haven't tested it on 2.8. Is there a significant difference in Enumeration?

Here is my source code:

```scala
class CaseEnum extends Enumeration {
  private val _cases = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[Value, Case]
  trait Case {
    private val name = {
      val name = getClass.getName
      if(name.endsWith("$$"))
        name.substring(name.lastIndexOf("$$", name.length-2)+1, name.length-1)
      else
          name.substring(name.lastIndexOf("$$")+1)
    }
    val value = Value(name)
    _cases += (value -> this)
  }
  
  def cases(v: Value) = _cases(v)
  for {
    m <- getClass.getMethods
    if m.getReturnType.getName.endsWith("$$"+m.getName+"$$") &&
      m.getParameterTypes.length==0 &&
      classOf[Case].isAssignableFrom(m.getReturnType)
  } {
    m.invoke(this)
  }
}
```
In your usage example, the members of the `CaseEnum` are objects. If I change them to be case classes, I have to create instances of them first, before they are visible as members of the `CaseEnum`:
```scala
  val Colors = new CaseEnum {
    sealed abstract class Color extends Case
    case class Red extends Color
    case class Blue extends Color
    Red()
    Blue()
  }

  Colors.foreach {c=> println("Value "+c+" is mapped to "+Colors.cases(c))}
```
With objects this is not necessary, since you are referencing them using reflection in your for-comprehension.

Otherwise, I'll bring your `CaseEnum` up for discussion in the next Scala meeting.
Why would enum members not be singletons?
Anyway, here is an improved version (see below).
```scala
class CaseEnum extends Enumeration {
  type CASE <: Case
  private val _cases = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[Int, CASE]
  trait Case { this: CASE =>
    private lazy val _id = nextId
    private lazy val _name = {
      val name = getClass.getName
      if(name.endsWith("$$"))
        name.substring(name.lastIndexOf("$$", name.length-2)+1, name.length-1)
      else
        name.substring(name.lastIndexOf("$$") + 1)
    }
    def name = _name
    def id = _id
    lazy val value = Value(id, name)
    private[CaseEnum] def init = {
      _cases += (value.id -> this)
    }
  }
  
  def cases(v: Value) = _cases(v.id)
  def cases(id: Int) = _cases(id)
  def cases(name: String) = _cases.values.find(_.name==name).get
  import scala.util.Sorting._
  def cases = stableSort(_cases.values.collect, (c:CASE)=>c.id)
  import java.lang.reflect.Method
  for {
    m <- stableSort(getClass.getMethods.toSeq, (a:Method,b:Method)=>(a.getName < b.getName))
    if m.getReturnType.getName.endsWith("$$"+m.getName+"$$") &&
      m.getParameterTypes.length==0 &&
      classOf[Case].isAssignableFrom(m.getReturnType)
  } {
    m.invoke(this).asInstanceOf[Case].init
  }
}
```
This version has a small improvement to a basic problem; maybe you have a better solution. Previously, the members were essentially assigned ids in the order they were returned by reflection. This order is not stable between rebuilds of the program. I therefore added code to sort them alphabetically. This of course does not solve the problem of adding elements later. Support was also added for setting the id. For example:
```scala
class Priorities extends CaseEnum {
  type CASE = Priority
  case class Priority(override val id: Int) extends Case
  case object Routine extends Priority(0)
  case object Urgent extends Priority(1)
  case object Emergency extends Priority(2)
}
```
More methods were added for looking up members, Also, a type member was added to solve a basic problem: CaseEnum needs to know the exact type it's supposed to return from cases().
I may have omitted any other improvements; these modifications were made quite a while back, and I didn't get around to posting them.
Thanks.
