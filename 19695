The following behavior is not really expected:

scala> val v = 9.2d
v: Double = 9.2

scala> val d = BigDecimal(v)
d: scala.math.BigDecimal = 9.2

... But

scala> val v = 9.2f
v: Float = 9.2

scala> val d = BigDecimal(v)
d: scala.math.BigDecimal = 9.199999809265137

There should be an apply method for BigDecimal that takes a Float ...

The work-around is to pass in a MathContext that is MathContext.DECIMAL32.

I did notice, though for Double, MathContext.DECIMAL64 *should* be used but 128 is used instead.
