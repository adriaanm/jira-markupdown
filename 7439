Given this solution, and thinking about it some more, maybe the correct resolution would be to warn (or error) when a superclass' method (with a specialized type parameter) is overridden with a method that is not specialized?

It seems clear that you either need to override bar and bar$mcI$sp or neither. The other option would be for the subclass' bar to be automatically specialized, but that seems a bit risky. On the other hand it would certainly be more convenient.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this?
