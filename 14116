SLS 5.2 Modifiers defines the LocalModifier production as follows:
```scala
LocalModifier ::= ‘abstract’ 
                | ‘final’ 
                | ‘sealed’ 
                | ‘implicit’ 
                | ‘lazy’ 
```

On the other hand, Chapter A Syntax Summary defines the LocalModifier production as:
```scala
LocalModifier ::= ‘abstract’ 
                | ‘final’ 
                | ‘sealed’ 
```

The summary should be updated to reflect the definition in SLS 5.2
