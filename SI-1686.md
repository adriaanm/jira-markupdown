In some configurations remote actors do not work -- objects received over the TCP stream get unmarshaled into the wrong classes, causing exceptions that abort the listener thread. This happens in my configuration: Mac OS X 10.5.6, Java SE 1.5.0_16 (the stock version), Scala 2.7.3.

This can be reproduced using the remote-actors example given at http://www.dirkmeister.de/2008/12/25/remote-actors-in-scala

The specific behavior is either a MatchException involving a Node object, or a ClassCastException involving a Symbol (altering the main app slightly causes one or the other to occur.) In each case, the full name of the expected and the offending class are _identical_ -- this implies the class is getting loaded twice by different ClassLoaders, resulting in two incompatible classes with the same name. Bad news. (This appears to be the same issue reported in SI-856. That one was closed by its author as a misunderstanding, but with no explanation as to why.)

I've tracked the problem down to the CustomObjectInputStream class (in JavaSerializer.scala). If I disable this class by setting RemoteActor.classLoader = null, then the problem goes away.

The purpose of this class seems to be to give a different Java ClassLoader first crack at loading classes while unserializing objects received from the remote Actor. By instrumenting the code, I found that the only class that gets loaded specially is the one that later fails the type checking (e.g. scala.Symbol). If I check the getClassLoader property of the various classes being resolved by this method, scala.Symbol ends up with a different one (a sun.misc.Launcher$$AppClassLoader) than all the others (a java.net.URLClassLoader).

Where did this AppClassLoader come from? it's the system class loader as returned by ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader (called at RemoteActor.scala:50). I have no idea why this isn't the same as the ClassLoader used to load the Scala classes.

As the JDK docs say, the initial setting of the ClassLoader chain is platform-dependent. It appears there's something about my platform or configuration that's incompatible with whatever it is this custom resolveClass method is trying to do.

Therefore I believe that it is incorrect for the remote-actor package to set RemoteActor.classLoader to the system class loader by default, since this causes incorrect behavior on some platforms. As far as I can tell, the purpose of this custom classLoader property is to support situations where Scala is running under a special ClassLoader; this seems like an exceptional case, so it shouldn't be handled as the default.

This issue has been discussed in a thread on the scala-user list, which you can read at
