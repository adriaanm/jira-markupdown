To me, this is an exception to the rule, which is something that really doesn't fit Scala. However it works implementation-wise, I'm guided by a simple rule:

Pattern match works on val assignments, for-comprehensions and case statements.

Only there's an exception on for-comprehensions. Worse still, not an exception of an edge case no one is likely to use, or which would be hard to read, but an exception preventing an useful behavior. Right now, one can't express something like "for all ints in this list" in a direct way.
