I ported `PartiallyOrdered` to [org.hammerlab:iterator](https://github.com/hammerlab/iterator) ([mvn central link|http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.hammerlab%22%20iterator]) and made it extend `Any` as a work-around.

I just tried to open the scala repo to send a PR but the IntelliJ scala plugin threw errors trying to load it, will look in to filing that elsewhere ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯
