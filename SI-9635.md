When the classpath references a unpackaged (not a jar) directory, scaladoc does not generate links to the url provided via the -doc-external-doc flag.

Pretty sure this fixes it:
https://github.com/jgrean/scala/commit/becc3628086409d1a1f29663865d3227ec5fa2a9

But I need to figure out the testing+PR process, and verify I've used the canonical way to verify a class file is part of a classpath, before I'm ready to submit a PR.

Example Case:
We have two separate scala libraries we're building from source in the same sbt parent project, with nightly scaladoc builds. Currently it's a pain to link them without first packaging the dependency as a jar and referencing that in the dependent project instead of the sbt project.

Verified the links now exist, but are broken per:
https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9967
So we should close this one but leave SI-9967 open...?
