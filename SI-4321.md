=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
  Int.MinValue to Int.MaxValue by Int.MaxValue
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
{code}
  scala.collection.immutable.Range = Range(-2147483648, -1, 2147483646)
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===
{code}
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Seqs cannot contain more than Int.MaxValue elements.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:            2.9.0.r24394-b20110307020059

A related problem is SI-4308.

I wonder if we have to decide whether to reject things like "Int.MinValue to Int.MaxValue" (by assuming step size is 1) and fail fast or if it is possible to see if there is a "by someInt" following, resulting in an amount of less than Int.MaxValue elements.

Currently both approaches don't work reliably.
(In r24508) Some boundary conditions in range.  Also bit the bullet on getting
infix implicits to Integral and Fractional.  As a bonus this patch
knocked 10,000 long boxings off a specialized test.  Who knew.
Closes SI-4308, SI-4321, review by community.
