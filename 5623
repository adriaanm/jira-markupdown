I found a workaround, this however is not ideal because it relies on implementation specific details of Scala:
```scala
trait OnCreate extends DelayedInit {
  def onCreate:Unit
  
  def delayedInit(body: => Unit) = {
    body
    
    if ((body _).getClass.getDeclaringClass == this.getClass)
    {
      onCreate
    }
  }
}

class A extends OnCreate {
  def onCreate = println("Creation is fully complete")
  val x = ""
  println("a complete")
}

class B extends A {
  val y = ""
  println("b complete")
}
```

Executing `new B` results in:
```scala
a complete
b complete
Creation is fully complete
```
