= problem =
A lot of values that I compute are huge, and when done in the REPL, a
binding similar to:

  val res3 = <big memory space value>

is introduced by Scala.  After a few of these bindings I run out of memory, and
have to start the REPL afresh. 

Workarounds like always binding a var at the REPL and clearing it, or wrapping all REPL values with SoftReference are too annoying.

= enhancement recommendation =
Always bind top level values to some fixed identifier like "it", etc. 
Just checked this after a REPL :reset, same story.

```scala
byte[33554432] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...}
 a of $line6.$read$$iw$$iw$
  MODULE$ of $line6.$read$$iw$$iw$

```
Yeah, nothing short of nulling them out will get them back as things presently stand - they are statically reachable.
Turns out supporting GC of bindings in the `:reset` command is much easier, we just need to make sure the classloader we're discarding is not retained as the context classloader of any thread or in a field of a runtime reflection mirror that we're storing in the REPL.

Fixing that perhaps doesn't go far enough to provide a useful answer for the enhancement request, however. From my commit comment:

```
    While this commit makes :reset perform its advertised function,
    it doesn't go further to making it a particulary useful command.
    Ideally we'd offer a mechanism to transport some data across a :reset
    boundary. The user could do something like this manually by stashing
    data in a `java.util.Map` hosted in some class in the same classloader
    as IMain. They would also have to restrict this to sending "pure data"
    rather than instances of data types defined in the REPL session
    itself.
```
