After launching the REPL from sbt, the :javap command does not work for class names:

scala> :javap iControl.services.CommonIPPortDefinition

scala> :javap iControl.services.CommonIPPortDefinition

scala> :javap java.lang.Object


Scala 2.9.1 prints:

{noformat}
:javap unavailable on this platform.
{noformat}
Workaround: 

{noformat}
scala -toolcp /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_32/lib/tools.jar
{noformat}

However, it doesn't look like I can use this workaround from sbt.
IIUC, this is a request to backport a fix in 2.10 to search for tools.jar.

IOW, this works in 2.10, and "affects versions" is only 2.9.

https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.10.2/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/ILoop.scala#L376

I left my comfort zone and got the versions aligned, but alas IWFM on 2.10.

There was an enhancement for 2.11:

https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7410

On Ubuntu it's easy to get JAVA_HOME, java and javac at cross-purposes.  In my case, after installing jdk7, it left java at java6.  I've forgotten the details except that it was a confusing mode of failure; perhaps it's more confusing on 2.10.

I see there's an about command:

There's a debug flag that might help.  But what does this mean?

Not finding tools.jar should be a spurious report.

Running that again with JDK 6 works as expected:

Yes, that seems to be the problem, viz, java and JAVA_HOME do not jibe.

I was able to test this way, without munging my environment, thankfully. This is java at v6 and JAVA_HOME at v7; reflective invocation of javap finds the wrong tools.jar.

It does indeed fail silently.  Boy, that's confusing.

Let it never be said that :javap command does nothing.
