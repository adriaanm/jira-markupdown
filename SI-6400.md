Now `import scala.tools.reflect.ToolBox` can import an implicit class, and thus a conversion, even though the name starts with a uppercase letter. Since that breaks a lot of assumptions (Paul Phillips confirms he was confused at first), an example of this should be documented in this guide (and probably higher-up).
