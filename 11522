**Verdict:** (as per the mailing list discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-debate/5s05bUsZ_rk)
```
I also think it's important not to muddle the difference between 
object and class. But how about we make an entry (say for class Seq) 
like this: 

Consult the companion object for members CanBuildFrom, ReUsableCF, 
apply, canBuildFrom, concat, empty, fill, iterate, newBuilder, range, 
tabulate, unapplySeq. 

We can make "companion object" and all listed names link to the proper 
definition and we can make a dual entry in the companion object. 

The advantage is that searching on the wrong page still leads to the 
right definition, and at the same time people would be straightened 
out about the difference. If we feel the list takes up too much space, 
we can make the font smaller. But at least there's a hint for the 
puzzled users.
