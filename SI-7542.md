The semantics of constant folding are a source of endless confusion, ignorance, and eventually consternation.

- that one signals it should take place with "final", a word already triple-overloaded in meaning by java
- that there can be no type annotation, a requirement which seems utterly arbitrary to someone not versed in the implementation

And even if you know all the rules, you have a good chance of being out of luck:

- since you can't annotate the type, there is no way to see a Byte, Short, or Char inlined (as those types are never inferred for literals)
- you are required to know implementation details to know what will actually be inlined, because superficially identical sources fall out differently, as here:
```scala
object Test {
  final val s1 = "abc"
  final val s2 = s"${s1}def"
  final val s3 = s1 + "def"
  def s4 = s2
  def s5 = s3
}
```
Is it reasonable to expect people to intuit that s5 has only a reference to string constant "abcdef", but s4 calls s2? I don't think so.

There is an obvious solution, which will also be the right kind of obvious to the scala programmer. If you want a constant inlined, mark it @inline.

We can do this immediately, keeping the final semantics as well for as long as desired, but ideally deprecating it in favor of @inline now.
The interaction with static annotations needs to be figured out.

Here's one more visible difference to the the current scheme that I noticed a while back in `ThreeValues`.

```scala
scala> object O { final val YES = 1; YES: Byte }

scala> object O { @inline val YES = 1; YES: Byte }
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: Byte
       object O { @inline val YES = 1; YES: Byte }
                                       ^                                          ^
```
Scala didn't hit 16k inquiries on StackOverflow because it has no rough edges.

Scala is a smooth operator five days a week; on weekends, it should get edgy.

Just normalizing this feature will cut my SO rating by about half.  I think the other half is overload resolution.  After wasting time recently on another overload question, I was kind of hoping you'd solve signature selection with annotations first.  Overloading is so annoying that people keep asking the same questions and picking the wrong answers!  To paraphrase paulp on this score, "This question is to the wrong answer."

OK, that's not as funny as the t-shirt I'm wearing right now with the original paulpism, "These answers are all to the wrong question."

By the way, what is the symbol for the "smooth operator"?
