Copied from SUGGEST-30:

In Scala REPL (interactive interpreter), type this:

scala> Set(1, "1.2")
res11: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Any] = Set(1, 1.2)

The result does not put a quote on "1.2". Then the user cannot easily see what type each member is in the set. In addition, for the following:

scala> Set(1, "1.2 ")
res15: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Any] = Set(1, "1.2 ")

Quotes are added for string with leading/trailing whitespaces. This adds inconsistency. Also considering the following:

scala> Set(1, "1.2, 55")
res18: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Any] = Set(1, 1.2, 55)

Isn't the result confusing?

Please consider always adding quotes on strings in REPL result. Thank you.
