{code}
class A {
  def foo(a: Int) = 0
}

class RichA {
  def foo(a: String) = 0
  def foo(a: String, b: String) = 0
}

implicit def AToRichA(a: A) = new RichA

val a = new A
a.foo(1)

a.foo("")       // Without implicits, a type error regarding invalid argument types is generated at `""`. This is
                // the same position as an argument, so the 'second try' typing with an Implicit View is tried, 
                // and AToRichA(a).foo("") is found.
                //
                // My reading of the spec "7.3 Views" is that `a.foo` denotes a member of `a`, so the view should
                // not be triggered.
                //
                // But perhaps the implementation was changed to solve See https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1756
                
a.foo("a", "b") // Without implicits, a type error regarding invalid arity is generated at `foo(<error>"", "")`.
                // Typers#tryTypedApply:3274 only checks if the error is as the same position as `foo`, `"a"`, or `"b"`.
                // None of these positions match, so the 'second try' typing with Implicit Views is not tried
{code}
(In r21193) Closes SI-2913. Review by rytz. (The error was that too few/too many argument errors had a position
different from the other errors, so no second try was done for them.)
