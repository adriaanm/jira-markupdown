the following file is crashing the compiler:
----------------------------------------------
https://github.com/playframework/Play20/blob/master/framework/src/play/src/main/scala/play/api/libs/json/Util.scala

stack trace:
-----------
[elided]

I deleted the stack trace because it's all spurious; the only relevant information is "OutOfMemoryError".
The exponent is applied during type parameter inference.  If you wish to work around:
```scala
// All the expressions which look like this
def ~[A21](m3:M[A21]) = new CanBuild21(canBuild(m1,m2),m3)
// Should instead be generated like this
def ~[A21](m3:M[A21]) = new CanBuild21[A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A18, A19, A20, A21](canBuild(m1,m2),m3)
```
Then the problem will go away.
