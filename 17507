I have a class:
```scala
abstract class foo(a: Int, b: Int) extends scala.DelayedInit {
  def delayedInit(x: => Unit) {
    println("delayed init");
    x
  }
}
```
In the repl:
```
scala> new foo(1, 2) { println("in here") }
delayed init:
in here
res14: foo = $anon$1@17c95b4c
```
As expected.  It also works for foo(a = 1, b = 2).  However, if I supply named arguments in a different order to the way they are defined, then I get:
```
scala> new foo(b = 2, a = 1) { println("in here") }
in here
res20: foo = $anon$1@1f8bd6f9
```
and the delayedInit method isn't invoked.

The real world application I have of this is in Specs, when defining an Around scope that takes named parameters that have default values defined, such as these in Play framework:
