```scala
scala> scala.reflect.runtime.universe.reify { var a:Int = _ }
<console>:11: error: local variables must be initialized
              scala.reflect.runtime.universe.reify { var a:Int = _ }
                                                         ^
```
I still don't know what difference between `var a:Int = 0` and `var a:Int = _` are.
```
Scala Reference, 4.2

A variable definition var x: T = _ can appear only as a member of a template. It introduces a mutable field with type T and a default initial value. The default value depends on the type T as follows:
0 if T is Int or one of its subrange types, 0L if T is Long,
0.0f if T is Float,
0.0d if T is Double,
false if T is Boolean,
() if T is Unit,
null for all other types T .
```
But REPL accepts that. Does it matter?
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.7.0_09).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> var x: Int = _
x: Int = 0

```
REPL lines are embedded in a template of some sort. (An object, or maybe a class.)
