Why should toString be special when it comes to overloading? Why should it be forbidden to overload it? I think something else should be fixed. I do not think one can construct a compelling argument to forbid something that is allowed by the specification.

I think if this method is renamed (for the sake of improved method names, for instance), it should be renamed *after* the overloaded toString case is handled properly. In the meantime, it provides a valuable test case.
