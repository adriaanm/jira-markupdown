This holds only when the companion object is not defined and it looks like the hover belongs to the implicit companion object that scalac creates to hold the default values of the parameters. If the companion object is defined then the hover is correct.

See the attached screeshots.

Using eclipse 3.5.1 and sdt r19928.
Sorry I was wrong in my last comment. This bug is still valid in r20019 so please ignore my last comment.

The problem with my testing was that I already had a companion object defined and to test this issue I just commented out the companion object and saved the file. Because of #2443 Eclipse's model did not get updated correctly so I was still seeing the correct hover because Eclipse believed the the companion object still existed.
(In r20115) Fixed #2752.
