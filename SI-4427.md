=== Additional information ===

A straw poll reveals that Scala programmers far and wide have come to rely on the implicit scope including the package objects of the containing packages of the parts of the type.

Assuming this is intentional, or at least serendipitous, it ought to be enshrined in the spec.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC1

More than 3 years, still not documented.

This seems to be the current language:

Note that packages are internally represented as classes with companion modules to hold the package members. Thus, implicits defined in a package object are part of the implicit scope of a type prefixed by that package.
