When I use an 'if' clause with a stream in a 'for' comprehension, it begins to slow down severely. The following code will generate multiples of 37 up until around 5.2 million, and then slows down to a crawl:
```scala
object ForIfTest {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    for {
      n <- Stream.from(1) if (n % 37) == 0
    } {
      println(n)
    }
  }
}
```

However, when I replace the 'if' clause with a filter, the performance problem goes away:
```scala
object ForIfTest {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    for {
      n <- Stream.from(1).filter(a => { (a % 37) == 0 })
    } {
      println(n)
    }
  }
}
```
Duplicate of #9134 / #8990. Those issues are fixed in the 2.12 branch. Due to binary compatbility constraints, we can't find a way to fix them in 2.11.7, your workaround seems like the best option.
