=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
  val a = new collection.mutable.ArrayStack[Int]
  a push 1
  a push 2
  a push 3
  a.reverse  // Prints 2, 3, null
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

{{reverse}} will produce the reverse of an ArrayStack

=== What do you see instead? ===

If the length is not divisible by two, the last components of the stack are `null` instead of whatever was supposed to be there.

=== Additional information ===

The relevant code is line 172 in ArrayStack.scala:

{code}
  def result = new ArrayStack[T](table.reverse, index)
{code}

which is incorrect since end of the `table` array is `null`.  Instead,

{code}
  def result = {
    var i = 0
    while (2*i < index) {
      val t = table(i)
      table(i) = table(index-i-1)
      table(index-i-1) = t
      i += 1
    }
    new ArrayStack[T](table,index)
  }
{code}

or somesuch would work.  If the contract with builders is supposed to include the ability to call `result` multiple times, then a new array should be created and the result should be copied across in reverse order:

{code}
  def result = {
    var newtable = new Array[AnyRef](table.length)
    var i = 0
    while (i<index) {
      newtable(index-i-1) = table(i)
      i += 1
    }
    new ArrayStack(newtable, index)
  }
{code}

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC2
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.04
Fixed in r24884.
