Since https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4026 we respect {{@Retention}} on java annotation classes.

When the annotation class is parsed from source, the meta-annotation is skipped. In SI-8926 we changed the default visibility back to {{RUNTIME}} for annotations without a {{@Retention}} meta-attribute.

Instead, we should extend the java parser.
