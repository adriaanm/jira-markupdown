Here is another case where the optimizer in scala `2.11.x` is generating incorrect code:
```scala
class Bust(val x: Long) {
  def sameDirection(y: Long): Boolean = 
    (y == 0 || x == 0 || ((y > 0) == (x > 0)))
}

object Bust {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val b = new Bust(1L)
    assert(!b.sameDirection(-1L))
  }
}
```

This should clearly run without error, but the assertion fails in `2.11.x` when `-optimise` is specified. It works fine if `-optimise` is left off, and it works fine in scala `2.10.x`.

I also tried this with the latest scala nightly build ({{scala-2.11.8-7492bda-nightly}}), but it still fails.
