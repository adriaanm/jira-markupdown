Having the @static annotation would fill one feature of the JVM not possible in Scala.

For practicality, it will help in these cases:
1. Some libraries require a static field. In particular, the android SDK requires classes implementing the Parceable interface to have a CREATOR static field

2. It will allow to create utility methods that are available "idiomatically" from Java code

I know that theoretically one can create a compiler plugin to do this. But there are few people that know how to do this.
