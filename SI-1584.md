How to reproduce:

 1. Enter the Scala perspective and create a New Scala Project & Give it any name
 1. Create a package, "hello", in the newly created project
 1. With package "hello" selected, run File -> New Scala Class and name it "Hello" and give it a main method exactly as follows: 
```scala
package hello

class Hello {
  def main(args:Array[String]) = println("hi world")
}

```
 1. Now right-click Hello in the package explorer and select "Run As -> Scala Application" which will fail as expected with a {{ClassNotFoundException}}.
 1. Now change the Hello class to a singleton object by replacing {{class}} with {{object}} so it will look exactly as follows:
```scala
package hello

object Hello {
  def main(args:Array[String]) = println("hi world")
}

```
 1. Now Right-Click and select "Run As -> Scala Application" again. This should work but results in {{Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main}}.

Running Project -> Clean will fix the problem but the above behavior is unexpected & confuses noobs like me :)

I was able to reproduce this on my !MacBook and Vista box.

I see a similar, unexpected behavior:

With the scale source file

```scala
package whf.scala.ui

class ObjectWithSameNameConsoleReproducer {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println("running")
  }
}

object ObjectWithSameNameConsoleReproducer extends ObjectWithSameNameConsoleReproducer

object ObjectWithDifferentNameForConsoleReproducer extends ObjectWithSameNameConsoleReproducer
```

the Package Explorer shows four nodes, one for the source file and three children for the class and the two objects.

For all four nodes, the context menu Run As > Scala Application
opens the Select Java Application Dialog with the pattern "**" (two asteriscs) and three matching items, the class and the two synthetic classes for the objects.

Selecting the class leads to an error dialog "Could not find the main class. Will exit."
and this console message:

```scala
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: whf/scala/ui/ObjectWithSameNameConsoleReproduce
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: whf.scala.ui.ObjectWithSameNameConsoleReproduce
	at java.net.URLClassLoader$$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:200)
	at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)
	at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)
	at sun.misc.Launcher$$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:276)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:251)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternal(ClassLoader.java:319)
}

Note the missing "r" in the demo class.

Selecting the synthetic class of the companion object with the _same_ name leads to an error dialog "Fatal exception ocurred. Program will exit." and this console output: 
```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main
Exception in thread "main" 
```scala

Selecting the synthetic class of the object with a _different_ name works as expected. In this example, it leads to the console output
```
running
```scala

Cleaning the project or closing/reopening the project has no effects.

I started with a reproducer for a Swing App, with the same results. The positive case here is that the JFrame shows as expected.

```
package whf.scala.ui

import swing.{MainFrame, SimpleGUIApplication}

class ObjectWithSameNameGUIReproducer extends SimpleGUIApplication {
	val top = new MainFrame{
	  val text = "ObjectWithSameNameGUIReproducer"
      // no content
	}
}

object ObjectWithSameNameGUIReproducer extends ObjectWithSameNameGUIReproducer

object ObjectWithDifferentNameForGUIReproducer extends ObjectWithSameNameGUIReproducer
{code}

Workaround: For a main object, that is the object of a class with a main method, use a different name from its class.

Issues with the current behaviour:

1) Selecting a Scala source file, only the two objects should be shown as matching items. The class should *not* be shown.

2) Selecting the object within the source file, it should be launched without a selection dialog.

3) Selecting the class, the menu Run As > Scala Application should *not* be shown.

4) If there are two runnable/launchable objects in a selection, there Scala names should be shown, not the synthetic Java names.

5) The Launch dialog should be named with "Scala", not "Java".

6) And last but not least: A companion object with the same Scala name as its class should be launchable.

Environment:

Eclipse Version: 3.4.0

Scala Plugin 2.7.4 final

This bug still exists in r19928 but it seems to me like yet another manifestation of #2443. plocinic said in #2581 that "In resident mode symbols of top level classes don't get removed which is why you get this weird behaviour even if A and B are in the same file" so I believe that the same applies here.
Replying to [ticket:1584 spiralhead]:

Just tried newest version 2.7.7 on Eclipse 3.5.
Followed instructions as in this append. Except defined it:
```scala
Object HelloWorld extends Application {
   println("Hello World!")
}
```
Launching as Scala application does not find static main method.
Cleaning the project as recommended here resolved the issue.
