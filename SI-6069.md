to reflect changes done for SI-5610
This didn't go through for SI-302/SI-5610, right? The nightly spec also doesn't include the proposed language from SI-302, under 6.6 function appls, that by-name is preserved under eta-expansion.

This is minor priority, but a major pain if you're confused by it.
