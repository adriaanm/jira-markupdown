The attached sample code compiles fine in Scala 2.11.7 and Scala 2.10.3 (Scala 2.9.3 warns that "TestMain.scala:9: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type") - even with {{-unchecked -deprecation -feature -Xfuture -Xfatal-warnings -Xlint}} compiler options - but prints "ChildA#InnerOne: b.InnerOne" when run, i.e. the match at TestMain:8 matches {{ChildA#InnerOne}} although {{x}} is {{ChildB#InnerOne}} (and thus I'd expect it to print "ChildB#InnerOne: b.InnerOne".
While I think the match should be possible (by type-checking the reference to the outer object) the compiler should at least generate a warning (like it does for matching things like {{case e:Seq\[String\]=> ???}}.
