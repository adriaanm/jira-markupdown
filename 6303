I checked again with the prebuilt nightly and indeed, no problem there. It turns out that in the build I used previously, I had disabled the check that prevents loading {{XX$class.class}} files (see #4767). Consequently, using the nightly, this one fails for {{scalac -Yinline}} (curiously enough not for {{-optimize}} ??).
