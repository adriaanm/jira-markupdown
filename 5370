Not sure whether this is a separate bug or not, but it could be related:
I'm trying to work with a string as a view. From my perspective this should return SeqView:
```scala
"abc".view.updated(0, 'A')
```
But it returns Seq, the same as in previous comment. It looks like it's missing appropriate CanBuildFrom.
```scala
Seq('a', 'b', 'c').view.updated(0, 'A')
```
works fine. 

It looks very similar to some of the code reported above, but this time it is about immutable structure.
