For example the following confusing signature is shown in stable scaladoc for s.c.i.HashMap:

{quote}
def ++[B](that: GenTraversableOnce[B]): HashMap[B]
{quote}

This is clearly wrong signature - expected 2 type parameters for HashMap.
What this usecase is even trying to show is not clear.
This has been a thing for as long as there have been use cases. There used to be multiple tickets; I don't know what is open anymore but there's at least SI-6071.
