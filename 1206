I'm seeing this problem again.


This time, it turned
```scala
   def expression : Parser[Expression] =
      value_expression~rep(colon_operator~value_expression) ^^ { tree => binaryExpressionTree(tree) }
```

into
```scala
...
   def expression : Parser[Expression] =
      value_expression~rep(final colon_operator~value_expression) ^^ { tree => binaryExpressionTree(tree) }
```

(The class extends scala.util.combinator.Parsers.!JavaTokensParser)

I'm running in a pretty clean environment,
with only a few plugins added, none of which
are doing anything in the Scala or Java editor space.

What's more (I'm not sure if this is related), there seems to be
a loop or hang in the builder; my project is stuck in

  Building workspace (0%)
