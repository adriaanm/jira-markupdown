class One {
  lazy val a = "foo"
}

class Four extends One {
  override lazy val a = "baz"
}

trait Two {
  lazy val b = "bar"
}

class Three extends Four with Two {
}

val three = new Three

println(three.b)
println(three.a)

Note that "three.a" is null.

It seems that in the override/trait mixing case, the bitmap$$0 slot is shared between two of the fields.

This may be related to 2105.

It would be great if this could be fixed for 2.7.7

It's a duplicate of SI-1535 and has been back-ported to 2.7.x.
