I told him to open this ticket, but maybe this is a known limitation.  But I'm not sure where the difference in fidelity arises.  Here is the equivalent of what the interpreter does, which does compile.
```scala
object o1 {
  abstract class ParametricMessage[M: Manifest](msg: M) { def message = msg }
}
object o2 {
  import o1._
  case class ParametricMessage1[M: Manifest](msg: M, p1: Class[_]) extends ParametricMessage(msg)
}
```
