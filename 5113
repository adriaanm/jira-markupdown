> I would expect a correct compilation, as class B does not override append. 

The second half of that sentence is either a non-sequitur or self-contradictory.

B doesn't override append, so the return type is A.  Thus you may as well be saying:
{code}
val b: B = new A
{code}
Surely you don't expect this to work.

This is not a bug, this is how things work.  You should probably read about this.type because it would solve the issue you have in the given examples.
