In addition to matching the contents of a tuple returned by `def unapply`, scala 2.10 also allows a single pattern matching the tuple itself. This is a regression from 2.9 in terms of pattern verification.

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_37).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> object X{def unapply(s: String):Option[(Int,Int,Int)]=Some((1,2,3))}
defined module X

scala> "" match { case X(b) => b }
<console>:9: error: wrong number of arguments for object X
              "" match { case X(b) => b }
                               ^
<console>:9: error: not found: value b
              "" match { case X(b) => b }
                                      ^
```

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-RC2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_37).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala>  object X{def unapply(s: String):Option[(Int,Int,Int)]=Some((1,2,3))}
defined module X

scala> "" match { case X(b) => b }
res0: (Int, Int, Int) = (1,2,3)
```

This is problematic because there is no warning (except in certain lucky cases) if argument patterns are forgotten, resulting in a case statement which will never match, e.g. `case X(x: SomeTrait)`.
Thanks Paul for digging up the ticket in which I flip-flop and argue (almost) both cases: #6111

I think this is currently as specified, but reasonable people could disagree on this.
Basically, we kill ourselves by using the same type for wrapping up multiple values as we do for encoding information about an extractor. If you want to say "extractor is arity 1, here is an ((Int, Int))" you are screwed. Possibly enhancements include
```scala
def unapplyArity: Int
```
for those cases where you want them to differ. But the worst scenario is the present one, where the pattern matcher is "flexible" in regards to the arity - maybe it's 1, maybe it's 3, let's see what works. We should be looking for more type safety in the matcher, not less.
I find this particularly egregious:
```
scala> "" match { case X((b)) => b }
res3: (Int, Int, Int) = (1,2,3)
```
That's a pretty emphatic way to say you expect Tuple1, but the parentheses are discarded and you are happily handed a 3tuple. (Typing out Tuple1(b) correctly fails.) 
Can we document it as a known issue in 2.10.0 which will be fixed in 2.10.1? If the policy doesn't already enable that approach, it should be crafted to do so, especially if "timely releases" is something to which we aspire.
I would have argued to revert the change and thinking more about it, since there are conflicting language design issues here. To me, "we changed the implemented language but we didn't figure out something quite annoying about it" would be enough for revert, at least before RC time.
I do see your point on timely releases, and documenting it as a known issue sounds good. The confusing part is that the old behavior also gave problems (in #6111), so we might want to leave the future behavior not entirely specified in the release notes, which is quite annoying.

Finally, legalese-speaking, the current spec indeed supports Adriaan; but pedagogically speaking, this behavior is allowed so implicitly that I suspect who wrote the text did not mean to allow this behavior, or simply did a very poor job at explaining it, so that even Adriaan was confused.
That's the risk of treating the spec as holy writ. A common understanding of it shared by multiple parties should not be treated as an unnecessary luxury.
Marking as fixed, even though we require you to compile with `-Xlint` to be notified about this.
The warning seems to overstretch, only the first should warn below:

```

     |   def unapply[A](value: Either[A, A]): Option[A] = value match {
     |     case scala.Left(x) => Some(x)
     |     case scala.Right(x) => Some(x)
     |   }
     | }
defined module LeftOrRight
