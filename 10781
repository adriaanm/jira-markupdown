Partest doesn't force it, which is why the flag is supplied by tests that need it.

Just for fun, the comment from the transitional period before the switch:
{code}
-    /** I have distilled everyone's classpath hopes and dreams into the
-     *  question of how to resolve this boolean.  Right at this moment if I
-     *  do anything but default to true right here, partest chokes.  I'm
-     *  steadily reworking all the places partest gets its hands on the
-     *  classpath so eventually I'll be able to remedy that, at which point
-     *  my current plan is to have this default to false unless some
-     *  property or command line option is supplied.  This is negotiable,
-     *  but at this point I can say with confidence that less magic and
-     *  less autodetection is more better.

-    def useJavaClassPath    = true
-    // hypothetically:
-    // def useJavaClassPath = propIsSet("scala.classpath.guess")
{code}
That's four years ago, right after the "Decade of Sane Class Paths" initiative was announced.
