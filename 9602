The problem is when scalac reads the class file {{Vector.class}}. If a Scala class extends {{JList}}, even indirectly, SBT's custom compiler phase that extracts the API of all classes in your project will end up forcing the type of this constructor:

{code}
public JList(final Vector<?> listData) {
{code}

which triggers loading of {{Vector.class}}.

You might have more luck by wrapping, rather than inheriting from JList.
