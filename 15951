= problem =

the companion object for collection.mutable.Queue does not provide an empty method.

= analysis =

basically all collections provide an empty method in their companion objects (List.empty[A], IndexedSeq.empty[A], Set.empty[A], collection.immutable.Queue.empty[A], etc.)

for the mutable Queue, you currently need to use collection.mutable.Queue[A]()

= enhancement recommendation =

add the missing empty method.
