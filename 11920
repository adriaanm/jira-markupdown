The problem here is that the Scala classfile parser doesn't use the real classfile flags for java annotations, but makes them look like scala classes: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/ClassfileConstants.scala#L345

In reality, a classfile for a java annotation has the flags {{ACC_ANNOTATION}}, {{ACC_ABSTRACT}} and {{ACC_INTERFACE}}. They are all skipped when creating the symbol.

We also have to see what the java source parser does to java annotations in terms of flags.
