I realize only now. With the following change in trait 

`scala.tools.nsc.ast.parser.Parsers`

a compiler plugin can see range positions, irrespective of `-Yrangepos`
```scala
def r2p(start: Int, mid: Int, end: Int): Position = new util.RangePosition(source, start, mid, end)
```

I mean, you don't need the rest of `-Yrangepos` functionlity, right? 

Higher up in the override hierarchy one can also do that change at
```scala
method rangePos in 

trait scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Positions
```

(call it a workaround if you like).
