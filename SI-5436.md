Compiler will not accept the line,

`val c: Char = '\u005C'`

The error message on the console from 2.10.0-M1 is

<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
       val c: Char = '\005C'
                     ^

Instead I expect to see,

c: Char = \


(The specified character is the *backslash* character.)
This is as specified.  You have to escape backslashes, presenting them in \u form doesn't change that.
```
scala> val c: Char = '\u005C\u005C'
c: Char = \
```
