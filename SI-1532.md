Add the convenience method RichString.takeRight(n: Int)

e.g.

scala> "123" takeRight 1
res0: scala.runtime.RichString = 3

similar in spirit to

scala> List(1,2,3) takeRight 1
res1: List[Int] = List(3)
This should be part of the new collections library redesign that Martin is working on. Please look at https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/branches/devel-base-2.8.0/src/library/scalax for at snapshot of the new work.
