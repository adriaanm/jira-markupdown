Only people who spend all day in REPL sessions remember options like -raw for pasting. Are there any such people?

Maybe REPL could please just infer -raw mode when it needs to.

This suggestion brought to you by Poker Face a/k/a extempore.

Maybe infer paste mode if I enter class Foo and then object Foo, which is an important use case, to glue companions together.
