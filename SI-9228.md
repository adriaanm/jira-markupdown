The attached program causes a compiler error, resulting in the attached backtrace.

I haven't yet found a way round it (although I'm new to Scala) so I can't yet send you the most similar program that does work (and still does what I want); commenting out the line "propmap += newBinding" does get it to compile.

I've looked for an existing similar bug and couldn't find any.

The compilation is happening inside gradle, and I can't get it tell me the compiler version, so I've reported it against the library version it says it's building with.
Hi John,

I tried to reproduce the error by compiling your program with a variety of Scala versions, and with http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/google/code/gson/gson/2.3.1/gson-2.3.1.jar on the classpath.

However, I wasn't able to trigger the same crash.

% scalac-hash v2.11.5 -classpath /Users/jason/Downloads/gson-2.3.1.jar sandbox/test.scala
% scalac-hash v2.10.4 -classpath /Users/jason/Downloads/gson-2.3.1.jar sandbox/test.scala
% scalac-hash v2.11.0 -classpath /Users/jason/Downloads/gson-2.3.1.jar sandbox/test.scala
% scalac-hash v2.11.6 -classpath /Users/jason/Downloads/gson-2.3.1.jar sandbox/test.scala

Could you please try to reproduce the error with the command line compiler, outside of Gradle?
Thanks --- I'm using whatever version(s) my work desktop (Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS --- unfortunately that's still our preferred company version) provides by default.  Having hit another similar problem, I'll uninstall the version ubuntu provides (which identifies itself as "Scala code runner version 2.9.1 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL", and try installing the latest from scala-lang.org.
