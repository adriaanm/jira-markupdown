In 2.9.0.r24324-b20110222020042
```scala
import scala.util.Sorting._

val a = Array("a", "c", "b")

println(a.toList)
stableSort(a: Seq[String])
println(a.toList)
stableSort(a)
println(a.toList)
```

outputs:
```scala
List(a, c, b)
List(a, b, c)
List(a, b, c)
```

This means that both sort in-place now.

Can this considered to be fixed?
