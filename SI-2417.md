When multiple threads start with a shared immutable.HashMap or immutable.HashSet and perform removals, the resulting maps or sets can incorrectly report a size that is too large.  This is a problem in itself, but is also a problem when calling toArray, because the returned array contains an uninitialized trailing element.

There seem to be known problems with the current implementation (SI-1610), this may be another manifestation of a shared underlying synchronization error.

Attached is a small program that reproduces the problem on my dual-core laptop.
I am reassigning to Tiark, since this ticket is indeed related to SI-1610. A solution should fix both tickets.
See Martin's and my comments at SI-1610, the current immutable.HashMap implementation will be replaced. I'm leaving the ticket open for the test case, though.
