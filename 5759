It's better to crash at runtime because we do not want to spec anything about arithmetic errors. It would be piece-wise and messy (btw Scala is in agreement with basically every other language that has a spec here). Consequently elidable gets a tree as an argument just as if you had written.
```scala
elidable{x * x}
```
So, everything as it should be, AFAICS.
