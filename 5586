(In r24510) Removed long deprecated and obscure CloneableCollection.
Discovered we have a scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable which
does not extend java.lang.Cloneable, which is why Array is not
considered cloneable.  That seems wrong, but to be conservative
I gave Array the Cloneable interface without altering the scala
trait.

Also, if @serializable is deprecated in favor of Serializable,
should not @cloneable be deprecated analogously? Closes scala/bug#4307,
and a commit-question review by rytz.
