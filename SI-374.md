This is coming from #324. The `scala.BigInt` object keeps a cache of BigInts. This cache is unsynchronized and may result in different threads recreating `BigInt` objects for the same value (it can be reproduced on our sunrays). It remains to be seen if the cost of the synchronization is worth the savings. Here is the solution proposed by the original poster:

```scala
    private @volatile var sync = 0; // value irrelevant

... ...

    def apply(i: Int): BigInt? =

        if (minCached <= i && i <= maxCached) {

            val offset = i - minCached sync // acquire var n = cache(offset) if (n eq null) {

                n = new BigInt?(BigInteger?.valueOf(i)); cache(offset) = n;

                    sync = 0; // release

            } n

        } else new BigInt?(BigInteger?.valueOf(i))

... 
```
