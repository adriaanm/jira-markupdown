Those two projects work for me if I configure the Java builder for the Scala project correctly. To do this, right context menu click on the Scala project in the Package explorer, then Properties => Java Compiler => Building, then enable project specific settings, followed by disabling "Scrub output folders when cleaning projects" and add *.scala as a filtered resource.

These settings should have been selected if the Scala project was created using the New Scala Project wizard but won't have been if the project was created by hand.
