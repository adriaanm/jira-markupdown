The scala library documentation is quite poor in terms of crosslinks between methods. It would be a very helpful enhancement to point out in the method descriptions to related methods.

E.g. when I was looking for the "take" method in IterableLike, i wasn't aware of its name, but i remember "drop". In the text of "drop" there should be crosslinks to "dropRight" and "take". In "take", there should be crosslinks to "drop" and "takeRight", etc. This is particularly important for classes that have a lot of methods, i.e. where it is not easy to quickly go through the method list to determine the right method.
