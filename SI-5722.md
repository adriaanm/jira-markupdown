I'm not sure whether this can be called a bug or a missing feature, but I'd like to get this fixed in the long-term.

If you provide a tag for {{new Array\[T\]}}, it works. I think it is reasonable to expect the same for {{classOf\[T\]}}.

Maybe a future me is experienced enough to tackle this.

That thread doesn't convince me that this should have been reopened. `classOf` has a very specific meaning in Scala as is does in Java, it is our class *literal*.
