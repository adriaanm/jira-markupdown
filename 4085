Ok, but are they supposed to be equivalent all of the time?

Using TFn1 from above:
```scala
trait TFn1[I, O] {
  type app[i <: I] <: O
}
```

B and B2 below should be equivalent, right?
```scala
trait Test {
  type a
  type b
  type f = TFn1[a, b]

   // compiles,
   //  browsing the tree shows TypeRefs only
  type B = f#app[a]

   // should be equivalent to B?
   //  does not compile though,
   //  tree shows Existential as expected
  type B2 = x.app[a] forSome { val x: f }
}
```

The compile error related to B2 is the same as in the original report:
```scala
type arguments [Test.this.a] do not conform to type app's type parameter bounds [i <: I]
        type B = x.app[a] forSome { val x: f }
                          ^
```
