When the immutable HashMap is being updated by many threads simultaneously, exceptions occur:

java.lang.NullPointerException

I've just been bitten by this bug too, in 2.7.7.RC2.

I assume that the comment above by DRMacIver that immutable hash maps are broken by design in concurrent situations does not reflect the overall goals of the Scala team. An immutable data structure that is not thread-safe does not have much reason for existing.

The Clojure folks have made a big deal of their immutable maps (see, for example, http://blog.higher-order.net/2009/09/08/understanding-clojures-persistenthashmap-deftwice/), so to see whether they indeed behave better, I downloaded Clojure 1.0.0 and replaced scala.collection.immutable.Map with a wrapper for its PersistentHashMap:

```scala
    import clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap
    
    object Map {
    
        def empty[A,B]: Map[A,B] = new PersistentMap[A,B](PersistentHashMap.EMPTY)
    
        def apply[A,B] (elems: (A,B)*) = empty[A,B] ++ elems
    
    }
    
    class PersistentMap[A,B] (private val m: PersistentHashMap) extends Map[A,B] {
    
        def empty[C]: Map[A,C] = Map.empty[A,C]
    
        def get (key: A): Option[B] = {
            val e = m.entryAt(key)
            if (e == null) None
            else Some(e.getValue.asInstanceOf[B])
        }
    
        def update[B1 >: B] (key: A, value: B1): Map[A,B1] =
            new PersistentMap[A,B1](
                m.assoc(key,value).asInstanceOf[PersistentHashMap])
    
        def - (key: A): Map[A,B] =
            new PersistentMap[A,B](m.without(key).asInstanceOf[PersistentHashMap])
    
        override def size: Int = m.size
    
        def elements =
            new Iterator[(A,B)] {
                val it = m.iterator
                def hasNext = it.hasNext
                def next: (A,B) = {
                    val e = it.next.asInstanceOf[java.util.Map.Entry[A,B]]
                    (e.getKey,e.getValue)
                }
            }
    
    }
```

I reran my test where scala.collection.immutable.HashMap had failed, and the test completed without error.

Other tests I have performed suggest that, when a map has been extensively modified, clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap also has a much smaller memory footprint than scala.collection.immutable.HashMap.

You may want to consider reimplementing Scala's hash map to resemble Clojure's.
David McIver is right: the current immutable.HashMap is fundamentally broken (immutable data structures should be good for concurrent programs, right? So apart from the exceptions, locking on **every** read operation is, ... well, you name it). I'm working with Phil Bagwell (the original inventor of Hash Array Mapped Tries) on an improved implementation. It will not be part of the first 2.8 beta, but we hope that we can ship it as part of one of the later betas. As a workaround for Scala 2.7, I'd suggest using TreeHashMap when necessary.
Testing the attached Test.scala with the new immutable Map doesn't reproduce the bug anymore (as expected, of course :).
