According to SLS ch. 2 second para,

"Bindings of different kinds have a precedence deﬁned on them: Deﬁnitions (local or inherited) have highest precedence, followed by explicit imports, followed by wildcard imports, followed by package members, which have lowest precedence."

However, scalac (both 2.7.x and trunk) behave differently as illustrated,

A.scala:
```scala
package p

class BitSet
```

B.scala
```scala
package p

import scala.collection.BitSet

object Test {
 val b : BitSet = new scala.collection.mutable.BitSet
}
```

scalac produces the following output,
```scala
B.scala:3: warning: imported `BitSet' is permanently hidden by definition of class BitSet in package p
import scala.collection.BitSet
       ^
B.scala:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.mutable.BitSet
 required: p.BitSet
 val b : BitSet = new scala.collection.mutable.BitSet
```

indicating that the package-local definition p.BitSet has taken precedence over the explicit import of scala.collection.BitSet in B.scala.

The spec and the compiler should agree, and arguably the specified behaviour makes more intuitive sense than the current actual behaviour.
