The problem is that math.round(n) (== java.lang.Math.round(n)) is only defined for Float and Double. If called with Int or Long arguments, they are converted to Float/Double, resulting in an loss of precision.
Example:

```scala
math.round(123456789)
res17: Int = 123456792
```
A way to fix it is adding two additional overloaded methods round() to the math object:

```scala
/** This method prevents the implicit type promotion of Long to Double, which would lead to a loss of precision. */
  @deprecated("Rounding Long won't do anything. There is a high chance that calling this method is a bug in your code.")
  def round(x: Long): Long = x
/** This method prevents the implicit type promotion of Int to Float, which would lead to a loss of precision. */
  @deprecated("Rounding Int won't do anything. There is a high chance that calling this method is a bug in your code.")
  def round(x: Int): Int = x
```

Another possibility, which might be more correct (but I haven't thought deeply about this):

Move math.round(x: Double) to the Double class as an instance method and math.round(x: Float) to the Float class as an instance method.
Correction: Long doesn't seem to get promoted to Double, it returns Int.MaxValue/Int.MinValue with 
```scala
math.round(_x_L) // x being a sufficiently small/large number
```

But that's a Java feature, too. So I'll just leave it closed.

Locke would call that "Argument from authority" :-)
