@retronym - It's rather fiddly.  I keep losing the effect when I try to generalize tests because the JVM doesn't do a very robust job of fully optimizing the 2.11 code either.

However, the best I've got so far is at https://gist.github.com/Ichoran/94b4698905b905934dfd644f6cef7b4b

This is using Thyme (now up in a snapshot for 2.11 and 2.12) so I can iterate quickly on ideas.  (Note--some machines may need the `Thyme.warmed(0.03)` to be changed to `Thyme.warmed(0.05)`; the number is a target stability, and some machines never meet the smaller number.)  Given the relative lack of stability of results, though, it may be better to switch to a JMH-based test suite.  On the other hand, given the lack of stability I am uncertain how microbenchmarking results are going to translate into real-world performance.
