Hi,

When I use as signature for a method this one:

def foo(block: Unit @suspendable   ): Unit @suspendable =  {
      
}

it gives me:
compile: java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed
Thank you in advance,

Pierre
reproduced with trunk
```scala
import scala.util.continuations._
object Test{
  def foo(block: Unit @suspendable ): Unit @suspendable = {}
}
```
This is a workaround I am using:
```scala
import scala.util.continuations._
object Test{
  def foo(block: => Unit @suspendable ): Unit @suspendable = {}
}
```
