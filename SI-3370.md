I am using scala 2.8.0RC1 on java 1.6.0 on Linux Ubuntu.

The weak map in Symbol.scala (rev. 20028) stores WeakReference objects.  Upon creation (line 81), those objects are associated to a java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue, which collects them after gc.  The issue is that the queue is never emptied, and keeps on growing.  I don't see the purpose of this queue there.

The statement
```scala
scala> for (x <- 1 to 10000000) { Symbol(scala.util.Random.nextInt.toString) }
```
runs the JVM out of memory, while nothing should be kept in memory.

Applying the attached patch on Symbol.scala fixes the issue by simply removing the queue.  With this, the statement above runs successfully.
(In r21752) Removes pointless reference queue from the Symbol cache.
Closes #3370, no review.
