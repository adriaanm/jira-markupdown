I'll add that, if you're going with the narrowing type-range idea, you may not actually need the whole type range. You may be able to just use the bottom, which you repeatedly LUB with parts of the argument types, based on references in the parameter types. This is because you are just going to end up using the bottom of the range, anyway. If ends up not being below the upper limit created by the type of one of the arguments, I think it will end up shaking out after you are done inferring the outer type argument, when you move across the value arguments to compute *their* inferred types.
