If you try parsing the following file, parsing fails with an OutOfMemoryError:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<result>
   <title><![CDATA[Truthdig - Cartoons - <b>Iran</b> <b>Election</b> [Revised]]]></title>
</result>


The problem is the "]" at the end of the CDATA. Removing the final "]" makes the file parse fine.

A CDATA segment should end with the first occurrence of "]]>". As such, it should be legal to include a "]" at the end of the CDATA.




I just tested this again on a recent nightly build of 2.8 and it seems to still be broken.

Sorry for not including a test case. I thought that the test case I gave earlier still failed.

Here is a simple test case that definitely fails on the latest nightly build:

import scala.xml.parsing._
import scala.io.Source

val xml_good = "<title><![CDATA[Hello [tag]]]></title>"
val xml_bad = "<title><![CDATA[Hello [tag]  ]]></title>"

val parser_good = ConstructingParser.fromSource(Source.fromString(xml_good),false)
parser_good.document  

val parser_bad = ConstructingParser.fromSource(Source.fromString(xml_bad),false)
parser_bad.document


BOOOM!!!!

Please read how to do markup.  Use triple curly braces to bookend code.

Here is my comment in MarkupParsers which may serve to explain how this bug still exists after I already fixed it.  I guess cutting and pasting huge swaths of code might cause a maintenance issue.  Alert the media.

```scala
// XXX/Note: many/most of the functions in here are almost direct cut and pastes
// from another file - scala.xml.parsing.MarkupParser, it looks like.
// (It was like that when I got here.) They used to be commented "[Duplicate]" but
// since approximately all of them were, I snipped it as noise.  As far as I can
// tell this wasn't for any particularly good reason, but slightly different
// compiler and library parser interfaces meant it would take some setup.
//
// I rewrote most of these, but not as yet the library versions: so if you are
// tempted to touch any of these, please be aware of that situation and try not
// to let it get any worse.  -- paulp
```
Your link didn't work and so does the 'help' link at the top. Where should I read how to do markup?

Does this comment imply that there is an alternative XML parser available that works reliably?
(In r20582) More work consolidating the XML code needlessly duplicated
between the compiler and the library.  Having to fix #2354
in two completely different places was I found very motivating.
