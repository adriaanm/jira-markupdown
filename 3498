I misspoke.  "elements" was replaced with "iterator" in 2.8 so in light of that, "keysIterator" and "valuesIterator" make sense, though they are unfortunately verbose.

iterator() = iterator over this collection (of key-value pairs in the case of Map)
keys() = a new collection consisting of the keys of this Map
values() = a new collection consisting of the values of this Map
keysIterator() = an iterator over "keys"
valuesIterator() = an iterator over "values"

But the problem is that "keys" and "values" **also** return iterators in 2.8, so the API as a whole doesn't make sense.

I created another issue scala/bug#3145 for this.
