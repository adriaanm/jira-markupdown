There seems to be some limitation in the type inference when manifests are involved. See the following example:
{code}
object test {
  class A[T]
  implicit val aInt = new A[Int]
  
  def foo1[T](implicit a : A[T]) = 1
  foo1  // Works fine

  def foo2[T](implicit a : A[T], m : Manifest[T]) = 1
  foo2[Int]  // Works fine
  foo2       // Compiler infers T = Nothing and fails to find the aInt implicit
}
{code}
I've not been able to reproduce the problem if I replace Manifest with another kind.

Compiler: Scala compiler version 2.8.0.final
