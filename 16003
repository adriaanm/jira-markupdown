= problem =

Code with many nested closures will result in class files with very long file names.

= analysis =

Long file names are problematic on Windows:

– Windows 7 Explorer is not able to delete, rename, compress, or copy files with very long names, say 200 chars.

– The Windows API calls used by most Windows programs are limited to a path length of 260 chars. Hence, most Windows programs won't be able to access such files unless they are close to the top level of the file hierarchy.

= enhancement recommendation =

Generate class files with short file names.
