There at least two easy ways this ticket could be fixed:
(1) Trac SI-2540 suggests an efficient implementation for Iterator.withFilter.
(2) Declare
        def withFilter(p: A => Boolean) = filter(p) 

The commented out implementation using toStream is inappropriate as Scala's streams are not sufficiently lazy for such usage: the iterator's hasNext and next would be called too early.
