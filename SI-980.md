As posted on scala-user:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java
1.5.0_13).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> class A
defined class A

scala> case class AB extends A
defined class AB

scala> case object ABC extends AB
defined module ABC

scala> case object ABD extends AB
defined module ABD

scala> ABC == ABD
res0: Boolean = true
```

Change AB to a non-case class and the case objects stop equaling each other.
This is essentially the same as bug #883 (they differ in the details but it's the same phenomenon)
This is a duplicate of #883. A fix is forthcoming...
