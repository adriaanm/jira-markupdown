I've got {{-Xfatal-warnings}};

{code:scala}
case class PersonInfo(id: Option[ParticipantId],
                      gender: String,
                      rankPayEtc: Unit,
                      maritalStatus: String)
{code}

I'm getting the (fatal) error:
{{comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true}}

(a) I know that.  
(b) The warning is misleading, since I didn't use {{==}}; it's auto-generated.  
(c) How can I suppress this (fatal) warning?
It's just a field placeholder for a type that doesn't exist yet.

Using {{Unit}} is convenient because there are already {{Unit}} instances for 4 typeclasses I'm using for serialization and autogeneration of documentation.

I naively tried using {{Nothing}} (comparing {{Nothing}} with `==' doesn't elicit a warning), but then I can't declare instances.

I could also use a {{case object Dummy}} singleton of {{Dummy.type}}, which also doesn't elicit a warning, even though it's just as right or wrong in a "comparisons always return true" sense as using {{Unit}}.  Plus then I have to implement extra TC instances.
