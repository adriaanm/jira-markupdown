I simplified the example a bit further:

first file:
{code}
trait Foo {
  def receive[R]: R = error("")
}

trait Factor extends Foo {
  override def receive[R]: R = super.receive
}
{code}

second file:
{code}
abstract class Buggy extends Factor
{code}

I couldn't think of any further simplifications that still result in a crash
