I simplified the example a bit further:

first file:
```scala
trait Foo {
  def receive[R]: R = error("")
}

trait Factor extends Foo {
  override def receive[R]: R = super.receive
}
```

second file:
```scala
abstract class Buggy extends Factor
```

I couldn't think of any further simplifications that still result in a crash
