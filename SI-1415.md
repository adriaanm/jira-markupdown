```scala
trait Foo{
  trait Bar{
    private[Foo] def baz: Nothing
  }

  object Blip extends Bar{
    def baz = ???
  }
}
```

The method baz should be visible in Blip because it is scoped to Foo, but its presence in Blip is ignored and the compiler thinks the method has not been implemented. 
For what it's worth, if Blip is a class instead of an object AND you respecify the scope, this works.  Neither of those alterations by itself changes the outcome.
```scala
trait Foo {
  trait Bar {
    private[Foo] def baz;
  }

  class Blip extends Bar {
    private[Foo] def baz = { }
  }
}
```
