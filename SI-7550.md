First of all, bundles defined in REPL currently can't be found by scala.reflect.macros.compiler.Resolvers, because when one writes "def foo = macro Bundle.impl", the MacroHandler.referencedNames set doesn't contain TypeName("Bundle"), hence Imports.importsCode fails to import Bundle when compiling the macro def.

However even if this issue is fixed, e.g. by defining "override lazy val referencedNames = ImportVarsTraverser(member).flatMap(name => List(name.toTermName, name.toTypeName))" in MacroHandler, we still got a problem with the fact that macro bundles can only be defined as top-level classes or traits.
Here's a partest:

{code}
import scala.tools.partest.ReplTest

object Test extends ReplTest {
  def code = """
    import scala.language.experimental.macros
    import scala.reflect.macros.Macro
    trait Foo extends Macro { def foo(x: c.Expr[Int]) = x }
    def foo(x: Int) = macro Foo.foo
    foo(2)
  """
}
{code}
