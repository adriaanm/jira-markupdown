Sorry, a late correction:

[null]
"eq(x ) returns true iff the argument x is also the “null” object."

would need to be

[null]
"eq(x ), ==(x ) return true iff the argument x is also the “null” object.
ne(x ), !=(x ) return true iff the argument x is not also the “null” object." 



The correction is needed because section 6.3 later says "A reference to any other member of the “null” object causes a NullPointerException to be thrown"  and no NullPointerException is thrown for eq, ==, ne or != (only equals)
 

No change in my suggestion for section 12.1 (== and != are final, so the definitions need to be correct in Any)
