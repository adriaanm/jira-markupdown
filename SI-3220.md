Consider this code:
{code}
object LinePrinter {
  def main(args: Array[String]){
    // Note: \u000A is Unicode representation of linefeed (LF)
    val c: Char = 0x000A
    print(c)
  }
}
{code}
This code does not compile, giving the following error method:

{code}
LinePrinter.scala:3: error: not found: value is
  // Note: \u000A is Unicode representation of linefeed (LF)
                  ^
one error found
{code}

The problem is that the compiler transforms unicode escapes before removing the comments, leading to the following code given to the next compile phase:

{code}
object LinePrinter {
  def main(args: Array[String]){
    // Note:
 is Unicode representation of linefeed (LF)
    val c: Char = 0x000A
    print(c)
  }
}
{code}

This feature/bug is described in the Java book "Java Puzzlers" (see the sampler, it is Puzzle 2) as "thoroughly confusing". Corresponding Java spec is [JLS 3.4].

I would like to suggest removing lines of comments before converting escapes, because how it works now is highly surprising and unexpected.




Hi imaier,

sorry for reopening, but after re-reading the spec, I'm quite sure that the procedure suggested is well within the bounds of the specification.
Imho the removal of the //-comments especially fulfills the rule that: 

{code}
This transformed version is equally acceptable to a compiler for the Java programming language ("Java compiler") and represents the exact same program.
{code}

The second half of [JLS 2.2] reinforces my impression that it is not intended that parts of the comments should survive their removal before the program source enters the next phase, where only syntactic grammar is allowed:

{code}
These input elements, with white space (�3.6)  and comments (�3.7)  discarded, form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for the Java programming language and are called tokens (�3.5).
{code}

To wrap up my arguments, I think that is a good idea to remove comments before entering the next phase of compilation because:
  - It stays within the Java language specification
  - A comment should not be able to change the behavior of a program
  - It behaves like detailed in the ECMA-334 spec (tested with Mono) which is the "other platform" Scala wants to run on
  - The removal is sensible, because it reduces unexpected side-effects
  - The 'feature' never had - to my knowledge - any support of an IDE, a text editor nor a syntax highlighter
  - I never have seen this behavior in any reasonable use, except to present this behavior to a unsuspecting audience of course :-)

An additional problem with the current situation is that Scala will not even be syntax-compatible between the JVM- and the .NET-platform.

If, in your opinion, the current behavior is the only valid one according to the JLS, it won't be possible to both fulfill the JLS and the ECMA standards. Having to choose between which spec to slightly 'adjust', I would suggest choosing the one which is more sensible (the ECMA one imho, which discards the comments).

Eventually I want to point out that this is not a VM spec which we closely have to follow, but the spec of the Java Language, so we should have a bit more freedom to improve upon it in the Scala language.

I would be really happy if you would kindly reconsider your decision based on the additional arguments and thoughts I tried to provide on that matter.

Thanks!  
Since string literals tolerate the unicode escape, so should comments.
{code}
scala> "\u000A"  // \u000A is LF
{code}
Somehow, Scala progressed over Java.
