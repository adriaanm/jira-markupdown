The reported issue was fixed in 2.10.1 (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2094), but this closely related one was not.
```scala
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.tools.reflect.Eval
 
trait A { type B }
 
object Test {
  def expr[T <: A : WeakTypeTag] = reify {
    null.asInstanceOf[T#B]
  }
 
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    assert(expr[A].eval == null)
  }
}
```

I have submitted a test case for the first issue and a fix for the second here:
