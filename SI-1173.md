This would help smooth over the differences between scripts and full fledged programs.
(In r23026) Fixed long standing annoyance which prevents the same source file
from being used as both a script and a program.  If a script has
only a single top level object with a main method, then that is
the object to which arguments will be passed.  (Contrast with the
current situation, where a wrapper object is wrapped around it and
the script will never do anything since there is nothing which can
reference the object.)

So now you can do this:

% cat script.scala
object FiddleDeeMain {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(args mkString " ")
  }
}
% scala -nocompdaemon script.scala a b c
a b c
% scala script.scala a b c
a b c
% scalac script.scala
% scala FiddleDeeMain a b c
a b c

Closes SI-1173, review by community.
This machinery behind this fix is pretty surprising, and leads to:

{code}
object Test {
  def x = "!!!"
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    Test.x
  }
}
{code}

{noformat}
qbin/scala -nc -Xprint:typer sandbox/test.scala
sandbox/test.scala:4: error: not found: value Test
    Test.x
    ^
[[syntax trees at end of                     typer]] // test.scala
package <empty> {
  object Main extends scala.AnyRef {
    def <init>(): Main.type = {
      Main.super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def x: String = "!!!";
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = <error: <none>>.x
  }
}
{noformat}
I was thinking: if the script contains only object/class/trait definitions, we could generate:

{code}
object O1
object O2 { def main(args: Array[String]) {}} }
class C

// Generated
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    runMain
  }
}
{code}

Where {{runMain}} is a macro that inspects the current compilation unit to find an one-and-only-one object with a main (other than Main itself), and then delegates to that.

This would then work for classes that extends {{App}}, too.
Or, don't generate a {{Main}} at all and just have the script runner call the user's {{main}}.
