For the attached source, the compiler crashes with `java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Settings.this.fromBuilder(new Test.this.SettingsBuilder) at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.NamesDefaults$class.baseFunBlock$1(NamesDefaults.scala:228)`

The mistake in the code is that `Settings` cannot access the SettingsBuilder` constructor any more. Thus, if I correct to `val sb = SettingsBuilder()`, the compiler does not crash any more. Expected behaviour: The compiler should report the invalid access to the private constructor.
#4645, #4685, #4707, #4987, #5058 are all the same bug.  Consolidating under #4987.
