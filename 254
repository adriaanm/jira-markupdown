I've been trying this periodically since it was reported fixed with no luck.  If there's some subtle requirement for making this work it's eluding me.  Here's as simple a test case as I can imagine compiled the 07/30/08 trunk - it doesn't run with or without a main method in the class.  Comment out the empty class and it runs as expected.

{code}
leaf:tmp paulp$$ cat Hello2.scala 
object Hello2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) =
    println("Hello " + args(0) + "!")
}

class Hello2 { }
leaf:tmp paulp$$ scalac Hello2.scala 
leaf:tmp paulp$$ scala Hello2
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Hello2.main([Ljava.lang.String;)
leaf:tmp paulp$$ scala -version
