It's not thread-safe. But the old builder using SetBuilder relies on updating a var without any synchronization, so it isn't thread-safe either, and neither were any of the other Builders I looked at (for List etc.). If it needs to be thread-safe, only the += method needs to be synchronized.
{code}
def +=(x: Int): this.type = synchronized {self += x; this}
{code}
