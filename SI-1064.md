scala.concurrent.Channel implements the read method as:
```scala
  def read: a = synchronized {
    if (null == written.next) {
      nreaders = nreaders + 1; wait(); nreaders = nreaders - 1
    }
    val x = written.elem
    written = written.next
    x
  }
```

The if (null == written.next) should be written as while (null == written.next) to avoid spurious wakeups and condition changes by new readers.
