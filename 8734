Paul: I've been poking around at this one, it seems similar to the problems we're trying sort out in macro-land.

This will fix it:

But I expect we can do a bit better, seems like it should be handled in the existing {{wasEmpty}} checks. Any insights to share? I'm all ears.

By resetting that return type, we only end up with one {{$anon}} symbol after typer.

Before:

{noformat}
*             object transformer1#12052
*                 constructor transformer1#15334
*                 value <local transformer1>#15335
*                     anonymous class $anon#15341 (final)
*                     anonymous class $anon#21138 (final)
*                         constructor $anon#21139
*                         value <local $anon>#21141
*             object transformer1#12051 (private)
{noformat}

After:

{noformat}
  object transformer1#6962
* object transformer1#6963
*     constructor transformer1#15504
*     value <local transformer1>#15505
*         anonymous class $anon#21364 (final)
*             constructor $anon#21365
*             value <local $anon>#21367
{noformat}
