=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
  fsc -verbose
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

should run and print options

=== What do you see instead? ===

On my Mac, about 3 out of 4 times, I see:
```scala
[Server arguments: -d /classes -verbose]
[VM arguments: ]
[Temp directory: /var/folders/3D/3DUozqrKEb8+epi1k+gn3k+++TM/-Tmp-/scala-devel/odersky]
[Port number: 63850]
java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
[Connecting to compilation daemon at port 63850 failed; re-trying...]
[Executing command: List(/Users/odersky/workspace/scala/build/pack/bin/scala, scala.tools.nsc.CompileServer)]
```
and then it's dead. The other, rarer time when it works, I see
```scala
[Server arguments: -d /classes -verbose]
[VM arguments: ]
[Temp directory: /var/folders/3D/3DUozqrKEb8+epi1k+gn3k+++TM/-Tmp-/scala-devel/odersky]
[Port number: 63832]
[Connected to compilation daemon at port 63832]
Usage: fsc <options> <source files>
where possible standard options include:
...
```
So it seems if fsc does not get a connection the first time around it never comes back.

I marked this high priority, as I wanted to use fsc in the course on Monday, and would hate to have to fall back to the last stable release.

I noticed it first around last Wednesday. At the time I was too busy to follow up. Could well be older than that, though.

(In r24148) Closes #4204, an issue with fsc.  When I switched to process
I mistakenly used a synchronous call when creating the server.
No review.

But, if we start server manually using command 

$ scala scala.tools.nsc.CompileServer -v

server starts normally (giving us it's port)

and fsc is able to connect it with "-server" option provided

but it's very inconvenient to pass -server option and start server manually all the time

That doesn't happen in the general case so I need some more clues why it's happening for you.

- What happens if you give -ipv4 ?
- What is the output of hostname on that machine? Can you ping it?
- Can you ping localhost?
I've been seeing this same symptom for a couple of days.
I finally tracked it down to a bad entry in /etc/hosts (specifically, while running scala scripts on 'myhost' with an /etc/hosts entry 'myhost 1.2.3.4', where 1.2.3.4 was incorrect).
The fix was to comment out the /etc/hosts entry (or correct it).  Strangely, the only problem was with scala, lots of other stuff (apache2, etc.) has been working fine for months.

The following program is useful for diagnosing this problem.  If it reports an incorrect IP address for the host, scala.tools.nsc.CompileServer will try to connect to the bogus host address:

    object InetLocalhost {
      def main(args:Array[String]){
        printf("%s\n",java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost())
      }
    }

Even if the bogus address is to a server running the scala compile server, the port address would almost certainly be incorrect, resulting in the failed connection problem.

Hopefully, this comment will help other hapless souls with this type of misconfiguration.
