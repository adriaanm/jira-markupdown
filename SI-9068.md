There is just no reason to keep this class, it is only a wrapper around a mutable reference to `List`. `immutable.Stack` has already been deprecated (in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/3cc99d7b4aa43b1b06cc837a55665896993235fc), to me it looks like it is just an oversight that the mutable variant isn't deprecated as well.
Is this about discouraging impurity, or are you saying that you don't think {{mutable.Stack}} adds any value over a {{var}} of type {{List}}?

If the deprecation instructions would be to rewrite

```scala
val stack: collection.mutable.Stack[A] = ???

val x = stack.pop()

stack.push(y)
```

as

```scala
var stack: List[A] = ???

val x = stack.head
stack = stack.tail

stack +:= y
```

then I think the result is clearly worse.
[~chris-martin] The specific example you give adds value, but not very much value.  And you lose value at the same time.  Take for instance

```scala
  var stack: List[A] = ???
  stack = prefix ::: stack
```

You'd think that

```scala
  var stack: mutable.Stack[A] = ???
  stack = prefix ++: stack
```

might work, but you'd be wrong because ++: isn't overridden.  (Even +: isn't overridden.)  You have to use {{pushAll}} instead.  And {{dropWhile}}?  Nope, it defers back to {{TraversableLike}}, which makes a new builder and reallocates the tail all over again.

So you are left with a convenience class that looks like it nicely encapsulates mutability, but in fact is full of unexpected performance gotchas because it turns out that to override everything relevant is actually really tedious and difficult to keep straight, especially as the library evolves.

It's better to just be honest about the situation and deprecate it than to try to fix all the problems now and then maintain the fixes every time the library changes.
Would it be feasible to deprecate only the inheritance, and let a simpler `Stack` class survive on its own?

I'd find it rather disheartening if Scala lost its stack as a result of getting lost down rabbit holes like `++:` which are so distant from the purpose of a stack.
Java has the `Deque` interface, you can use that one if you really want a push/pop API.
