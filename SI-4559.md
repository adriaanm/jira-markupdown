The following code compiles under Scala-2.8.1.final but causes the compiler to crash under Scala-2.9.0.RC4.

{code}
package mypkg {

  trait M { type C <: M }
  trait F extends M { type C = F }

  // requires private[mypkg] to reproduce
  private[mypkg] abstract class Private[E <: M] {
    type Sub <: Private[E#C]
    final val sub: Sub = null.asInstanceOf[Sub]

    def foo: E
  }

  trait Public[E <: M] extends Private[E] {
    type Sub = Public[E#C]
  }
}

import mypkg._

object Test {
  val seq = null.asInstanceOf[Public[F]]
  seq.sub.foo
}
{code}

The only workaround I can think of is to strip all the package private modifiers. Of course that would expose internal implementation as public API.


=== Versions ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC4

I think the bug is that it ever compiled.  If you make Private just plain private, it gives the message I would expect.
{code}
./a.scala:15: error: private class Private escapes its defining scope as part of type mypkg.Private[E]
   trait Public[E <: M] extends Private[E] {
                                ^
one error found
{code}
That is just as true a statement if Private is private[mypkg] as if it's private.

I've never heard of public classes with private parents.  Is this supported in the spec?
