This has already been fixed.  I have attached a patch that moves phaller's test from pending into files/continuations-neg and corrects the expected output.  It's not a very deep patch, but it does allow this bug to be closed.

Being that this moves files, you'll want to apply it with:
```
patch -p0 -E -i t3628.diff
svn rm test/pending/continuations-neg/t3628.check test/pending/continuations-neg/t3628.scala
svn add test/files/continuations-neg/t3628.check test/files/continuations-neg/t3628.scala
```
