It's not spurious.  Until better script support, maybe it could refrain from emitting either `args` or `argv`, especially if it appears to be unused.  Is there anything in the contract that says it must provide `argv`?  or was that a sop to early adopters?  I mean the official Typesafe support contract.

I was going to switch it back to Misc Compiler, but it would be a nice feature if you could turn off warnings about clunky synthetics.  That's not to say that generated code doesn't collect lint.  Whether you notice depends on whether the lint tool is one of those rollers with the sticky tape or the aerosol spray that eliminates all static cling within a one meter radius.  I guess it also depends on if you have a dog that sheds.

I sure hope Seth doesn't use argv.  I suspect he's just old-school enough that it's not outside the range of possibility.
