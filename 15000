I have installed the current nightly build (2.8.0.r2080-b20100208044206) and am unable to use either the *Refactor->Move* action in the Package Explorer or the *Move...* action in the Project explorer view. Likewise the common shortcut key *Ctrl+Alt+V* does not work.

Upon uninstalling the plugin I am able to move files as normal.

This problem is not present with the 2.7.7 final version of the plugin.
