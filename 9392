[~shinolajla] [~bmjames] Throwing exceptions is an inherent part of the design of the {{Duration}} interface.  Allowing time units at all, but enforcing a base of nanoseconds, means that the user can enter, either in a {{String}} or as a {{Long}}, an invalid value that will generate an exception (e.g. try 107000 days).  One can suggest that the interface be deprecated and improved somehow (make everything return {{Option}}?), but I think that goes beyond what is asked for here.  Even {{+}} on a {{FiniteDuration}} can throw an exception.

The simple change of making this particular method checked at compile-time when possible doesn't really fix the generic issue, and the generic issue isn't a minor change.  You can open a bug request against the tougher issue that {{Duration}} uses exceptions to communicate error states, but it doesn't make sense to try to fix this piecemeal.
