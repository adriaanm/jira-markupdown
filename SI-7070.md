The implementation restriction created from #5954 has two problems. 1) The problematic code works fine if compile with sbt. That means the restriction is breaking some people needlessly. 2) It's not binary compatible. The implementation restriction needs to be turned into a warning and the setting to get around the restriction needs to be removed.
