it looks to me like this ticket should be closed as "not a bug". the link warnings can be disabled with `-no-link-warnings`, and if you don't want to disable them, you can use `-doc-external-doc` to make the links work. the regex gunk in the SO answers being needed seems like a bug, but that would be a different ticket.

James, I'm guessing you just didn't know about the existence of these Scaladoc options — neither did until I investigated just now.

the off-by-one-line problem seems like a bug as well, but that seems like it should be a different ticket, too.

@VladUreche @gourlaysama what do you think?
