@sjrd - Yes, that's what I'm getting at, and change the docs to really clearly specify what behavior can be expected.

The only wildcard is how big of a performance benefit it would be for Scala.js.  If it's absolutely trashes JS performance for all array creations to have the 100% guarantee, well, maybe that's too great a price to pay.  I think ensured 0% is better than 94% with no warning on the 6% failures (well, not exactly 6%, really p(n = 16) + p(n = 32) + p(n = 64) + ...).
