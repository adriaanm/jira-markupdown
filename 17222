isEqual should be added to Option as a convenience method in order to compare a value with the value contained in an Option

def isEqual(other: Any): Boolean

so that you can write

Some(123) isEqual 123 = true

You can't use equals, because the other value is no option. This is a pure convenience method, one can do something like:

-Some(123).getOrElse(false) equals 123
-Some(123).exists(_ equals 123)
 
this should be a very easy addition.
