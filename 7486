What do you mean "bundling mac in the package"?

I'm not a Homebrew user, so somebody else would need to manage that.

I know you guys are really busy, I would rather see work done on the language than work on packaging that can be handled by the packaging people, as it distributes work amongst the community.

It sounds like you want to host a MacPorts repository yourself?  MacPorts is only started having binary downloads and there isn't a fixed and public repository API yet that I would want to code to.  I don't know if MacPorts supports multiple repository URLs like yum and apt-get.

If you make a scala-dist list, I'll join it.  You'll need to decide if there's enough traffic and discussions to warrant it.  But since you're making your own yum and apt-get repositories, it sounds like there could be.
