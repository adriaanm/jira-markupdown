The current REPL output for definitions is very confusing because it is almost, but not quite valid Scala and also inconsistent.

Some examples:
```scala
scala> case class Foo()
defined class Foo
```
```scala
scala> trait Bar
defined trait Bar
```
```scala
scala> type Qux = Nothing
defined type alias Qux
```
```scala
scala> val a = 1
a: Int = 1
```
```scala
scala> var b = 1
b: Int = 1
```

The Scala REPL's response should be more consistent reporting about definitions.
Possible solutions
- no output in the success case (as does the Python REPL)
- display the type definition (as it is currently the case but without "defined" )
- display the type definition as valid Scala
- ...
