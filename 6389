The issue isn't particular to getClass. The change that was made to getClass merely exposes something about the least-upper-bound algorithm that hasn't changed in many years. 2.9, 2.8, and 2.7 all show:

{noformat}
scala> abstract class A { def f: Class[_] }
defined class A

scala> class A1 extends A { override def f = classOf[Int] }
defined class A1

scala> class A2 extends A { override def f = classOf[Char] }
defined class A2

scala> List(new A1) ++ List(new A2)
res2: List[A{def f: java.lang.Class[_ >: Int with Char <: AnyVal]}] = List(A1@52ac5024, A2@2ec195e3)
{noformat}
