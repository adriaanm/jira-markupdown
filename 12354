New scaladoc still generates old URL to external dependencies.

For example: [Binding.scala's API documentation](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/com/thoughtworks/binding/unidoc_2.12/9.0.4/unidoc_2.12-9.0.4-javadoc.jar/!/com/thoughtworks/binding/FutureBinding.html) contains many old style links to Scala standard library, e.g. http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.0/index.html#scala.concurrent.Future . All the links are broken.
