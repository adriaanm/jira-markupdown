It is surprising when `splitAt` is not equivalent to a `take` and a `drop`.  For most collections (e.g. HashMap) the two are the same.  But with mutable.LongMap:

```scala
scala> collection.mutable.LongMap(0L -> "", 1L -> ".", 2L -> "..")
res48: scala.collection.mutable.LongMap[String] = Map(0 -> "", 2 -> .., 1 -> .)

scala> res48.take(1)
res49: scala.collection.mutable.LongMap[String] = Map(0 -> "")

scala> res48.drop(1)
res50: scala.collection.mutable.LongMap[String] = Map(1 -> ., 2 -> ..)

scala> res48.splitAt(1)
res51: (scala.collection.mutable.LongMap[String], scala.collection.mutable.LongMap[String]) = (Map(2 -> ..),Map(0 -> "", 1 -> .))
```

These should be made consistent (might have to wait for 2.12 for full bincompat overridden method--check).

Additionally, takeWhile and dropWhile don't seem to traverse the elements in the same order (so you can't split with them), and the Right versions need to be consistent with everything else also.
