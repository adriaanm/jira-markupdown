In the syntax summary of the Scala Specification (as of May 5th, 2008), the syntax for subclassing is given as:
```scala
ClassTemplateOpt ::= Extends ClassTemplate | [[Extends] TemplateBody]
TraitTemplateOpt ::= Extends TraitTemplate | [[Extends] TemplateBody]
Extends          ::= `extends' | `<:'
```

However, the alternative `<:` token doesn't seem to be supported by the compiler. Moreover, the `Extends` non-terminal is not mentioned elsewhere in the specification, and in 5.3 we have
```scala
ClassTemplateOpt ::= `extends' ClassTemplate | [[`extends'] TemplateBody]
TraitTemplateOpt ::= `extends' TraitTemplate | [[`extends'] TemplateBody]
```

Hence the syntax summary seems to be erroneous.
