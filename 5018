(In r23934) Closes SI-3984 by the most arduous and indirect route imaginable:
abstracts the common code out of the TrieIterators in HashMap
and HashSet.  When I raised this flag to find out if anyone would
open fire, all was quiet on the western front.  Although I wouldn't
want to write code like this as an everyday thing, I think it serves
as a nice showcase for some of the abstraction challenges we're up
against: performance looks the same and I will never again have to
fix the same bug in two places.  Review by rompf.
