I believe we should deprecate in 2.13 `scala.collection.immutable.Stream`. There are two reasons:

1. The current definition of `Stream` is awkward in that it is strict in its head. User code
    is cleaner and with fewer surprises if Stream is lazy in head and tail.

2. The term "Stream" is misleading in that it suggests some similarity with Java streams. 

I would propose to add in 2.13 a new type `LazyList` that can be used as a replacement for `Stream` but that is lazy in head and tail.
