I haven't been able to get a pip out of Scala with regards to SIP-18 and Dynamic. I can extend Dynamic (and scala.Dynamic) from objects and classes, create instances out of them, assign them to vals, and use those instances without any SIP-18 message.

This happens on REPL and Compiler. Trivial example to reproduce:

{code}
class X extends Dynamic {
  def selectDynamic(name: String) = s"Called $name"
}
val x = new X
x.test
{code}
