I haven't seen the tests pass on the command line in almost a year. I thought I could wait for someone else to run into it and fix it. I don't know why I ever think that.

Anyway, please don't use relative paths like "." in *.flags files because then those tests won't pass unless you are in the anticipated location. I habitually run test/partest from the repository root, not ./partest from the test subdirectory. Until a year ago it wasn't a problem.
```
% test/partest  test/files/neg/t6446-additional test/files/neg/t6446-list test/files/neg/t6446-missing test/files/neg/t7494-after-terminal test/files/neg/t7494-before-parser
Selected 5 tests drawn from specified tests
