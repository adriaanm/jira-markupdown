This is as designed. You can suppress the semi-colon inference by enclosing the entire application in parentheses:
```scala
scala> def greet(firstName: String, lastName: String) = println(s"Hello $firstName $lastName")
greet: (firstName: String, lastName: String)Unit

scala>  (
     |    greet
     |    ("", "")
     | )
Hello

scala> {
     |   greet
     |   ("", "")
     | }
<console>:14: error: missing argument list for method greet
Unapplied methods are only converted to functions when a function type is expected.
You can make this conversion explicit by writing `greet _` or `greet(_,_)` instead of `greet`.
         greet
         ^
```
