In a snippet code below, the function equalTrue is never called when the "case (caller:Actor, number: Int) occurs:

val primeTeller = actor {
    var continue = true
    var result = false
    while (continue) {
      receive {
        case (caller: Actor, number: Int) => caller ! (number,     equalTrue(number))                                             
        case "quit" => println ("quit"); continue = false
      }
    }
  }
It doesn't seem to be valid in Scala version 2.8.0.r18913-b20091004172123. I tried to reproduce it with following and it worked fine.
```scala
scala> val primeTeller = actor {
  def equalTrue(x: Int) = { println("equalTrue is called with " + x); x}
  var continue = true 
  var result = false 
  while (continue) {
    receive {
      case (caller: Actor, number: Int) => 
         caller ! (number, equalTrue(number)) 
      case "quit" => println ("quit"); continue = false
      case x => println("primeTeller: dint go in any case")
    }
  }
}
     |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | primeTeller: scala.actors.Actor = scala.actors.Actor$$$$anon$$1@ed6f0d

scala> primeTeller ! (self, 4)
equalTrue is called with 4
```
