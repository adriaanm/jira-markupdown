=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
trait A {
	def f() = println("A")
}

class B extends A {
	def g() = for(i <- 0 until 1) super[A].f()
	def h() = for(i <- 0 until 1) B.super[A].f()
}

val b = new B()
b.g() // ClassCastException
b.h() // ClassCastException
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The expected output is
{code}
A
A
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===

`ClassCastException` is thrown, as the compiler tries to cast the anonymous function to A.
