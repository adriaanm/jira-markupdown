I'm very glad to hear that you need them! Because there's no way I'm going to iron out the extractor issues on my own in the near future.  I have already sunk soooo much time into it and when I weigh the likely outcomes of ways I can spend time, choosing between fixing fifty things for sure and extractors maybe, "extractors maybe" loses.

So if you want to make extractors "our problem" that would provide me with some new enthusiasm, but I can't do it right now when there is so much else that only I can (or will) do.
