This is "fixed" in the [Ammonite REPL](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL), which doesn't use special colon-commands at all
```scala
@ 42
res4: Int = 42
@ ::
res5: scala.collection.immutable.::.type = ::
```

I have never used vim mode, but since we're not hogging syntax you could give it a shot
