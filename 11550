[~travisbrown] reported a similar problem related to name based patmat that I'm fixing here: https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.11.x...retronym:ticket/9029?expand=1
```scala
class Y(val _2: Int, val _1: String)

object X { def unapply(u: Unit): Option[Y] = Some(new Y(42, "!")) }

object Test {
  def test1 = {
    val X(y) = ()
    val yy: Y = y
    assert(yy._1 == "!")
    assert(yy._2 == 42)
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    test1
  }
}
```

I'm planning to look into the issue reported here as well as part of this work.
