That might seem reasonable, except that the container classes all fail to check for null elements before calling `##` on them, so for example `List(null).##` also throws. By contrast a `java.util.ArrayList` containing nulls hashes just fine.

Since this isn't a real method, it's easy to fix: add a null check to `ScalaRunTime.hash(Any)`, returning zero.

Seeing this with Scala 2.8.1, but looking at the new code including Murmur hash I don't think anything's changed.
You have to convince martin, I wanted to define ## as NPE-free up front but he doesn't want it any slower.

That List(null).## is an NPE is unrelated to ##.  It has been always.

Umm... seriously?

As I hope you're both aware, JVMs have to insert null checks _every time they dereference a pointer_. Consequently, they've got pretty good at eliminating repeated checks on the same pointer. Further, null checks (implicit or not) can generally be folded into another instruction using the bus logic.

So, what we're talking about here is replacing the current effective code:

`if (x == null) throw new NPE() else x.hashCode`

With:

`if (x == null) 0 else x.hashCode`

That's no change to the main code path and a probable reduction in bytes of machine code emitted...

Of course theory demands experimentation. So, Scala 2.8.1 compiling itself, which calls `hash` over 170 million (!) times:

Unmodified: 7m 23s

With null check: 7m 23s

Additionally, a microbenchmark (attached) showed a ~4% speedup with the change.
(In r24393) And extempore's original plan carries the day: null.## no longer
throws an NPE.  Took advantage of feature to simplify a bunch of
sharp-sharp calculations.  Closes SI-4311, no review.
