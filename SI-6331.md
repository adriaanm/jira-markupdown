Scala incorrectly optimizes away the if statement (without -optimize) in the following:

{code:lang=java}
scala> val x = if(error("x")) 0d else -0d
x: Double = 0.0

scala> val x = if(error("x")) 1d else 1d
x: Double = 1.0
{code}

The main problem is that although `0d == -0d` is true, it is wrong to treat them as the same.  It seems plausible this kind of constant equality check might be applied elsewhere as well.

Second, the side-effect in the if statement is discarded, although I don't know if there is a scenario where this could possibly matter.
`typedIf` lubs the branches of the conditional:

adapt replaces `<expr>: ConstantType\(x)` with `x`

https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Typers.scala#L1067

Probable fixes:

 1. call {{.deconst}} before lubbing the types of the branches; make sure treatment is consistent in other places lubs are taken. (Or maybe: Do this in lub/glb itself)
 2. Update {{Const#equals}} to differentiate +-0d (it already has similar handling for {{NaN}}). I think we can use {{Double.doubleToRawLongBits(this.value) == Double.doubleToRawLongBits(that.value)}} (and the equivalent for {{Float}}) to handle all the floating point esoterica correctly.

My last comment wasn't accurate: `deconst` was already called by `ptOrLub`. The real problem was a new fast path that avoids lubbing, which was added by virtpatmat.
