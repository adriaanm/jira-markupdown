When you create a collection, a lot of unnecessary work is done.

I think there's a middle ground between what we have now and macro/builtin compiler support. This reminds me an idea I had (and Miguel also mentioned to me) of early inlining. The current state of affairs is that code with foreach call like List(1,2,3) foreach println we first expand lambda to a class, we typecheck everything and generate lots of trees, then icode and only then we realize (if we are lucky) that we can inline foreach implementation, inline apply of a closure and throw away the whole class we generate for the closure. That's a huge amount of wasted work.

Many of these performance problems can go away with MethodHandles and invokedynamic. Therefore this bug should be broken up into pre-JDK7 and JDK7 versions.

The cases of particular interest to me are List and Array.

- List(1, 2, 3) leads to approximately this:
{noformat}  val arr = new Array[Int](3)
  arr(0) = 1
  arr(1) = 2
  arr(2) = 3
  val wrapped = new WrappedArray(arr)
  List.apply(wrapped) 
  val cbf = implicitly[CanBuildFrom[...]]
  val builder = cbf() // new ListBuffer[Int]
  builder ++= wrapped
  builder.result
```
When it could be done like this:
```
  new ::(1, new ::(2, new ::(3, Nil)))
```

- Array(1, 2, 3) leads to approximately this:
```
  val arr = new Array[Int](3)
  arr(0) = 1
  arr(1) = 2
  arr(2) = 3
  // Hey, stop right there! Scala, stop! Oh no...
  val wrapped = new WrappedArray(arr)
  Array.apply(wrapped) 
  val arr2 = new Array[Int](wrapped.length)
  var i = 0
  // throw in a closure and a boxing trip through Seq#foreach
  for (x <- wrapped.iterator) { arr2(i) = x; i += 1 } 
  arr2
{noformat}
Primitive array creation using `Array.apply` has now been hand-optimized in `Cleanup`, as was already done for reference arrays: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/8265175e
