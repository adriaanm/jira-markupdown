{code}
    trait ListParsers extends Parsers {
        def chrSuchThat(p: Char => Boolean): Parser
        def chr(c: Char): Parser = chrSuchThat(d ==)

        def letter  : Parser = chr(Character.isLetter)
        def digit   : Parser = chr(Character.isDigit)
        ....
{code}

The d == causes the compiler to barf due to an unbound variable d.


The chr(Character.isLetter) and chr(Character.isDigit) both cause compiler errors as well, but these differ by version. In version 2.6 the error is that there is an ambiguous call, i.e. isLetter(Int), isLetter(Char), and it doesn't know which one to use. In 2.7 the error is "error, missing arguments for method isLetter in object Character. Follow this method with '_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function." 

Neither set of error messages is much help (the '_' doesn't help). I'm just learning and trying to get the examples to run. So I don't know what the real problem is, but the examples in the book should compile, yet they don't.

There is also a problem with the use of curly quotes in the examples in the book. They are treated as an illegal character by the compiler. It would be very helpful if you could copy/paste from the PDF and have it compile.
