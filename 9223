Regressed with the new encoding of PartialFunctions: 383d28daa16

But it's possible that this just lifted the lid on some existing problem in erasure; I'm trying to track down why `x1` in the non-bridge signature below erases to `Object`, rather than `Container`.
```scala
        final override def applyOrElse(x1: Object, default: Function1): Object = {
        final override <bridge> def applyOrElse(x: Object, default: Function1): Object = $anonfun.this.applyOrElse(x.$asInstanceOf[Container](), default)
```
