For example, the comment below from src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/icode/Opcodes.scala causes the syntax higlighting to render the code following the comment as if it was commented out (see attached screenshot).
```scala
/** This class represents a CHECK_CAST instruction
 * Stack: ...:ref(oldtype)
 *    ->: ...:ref(typ <=: oldtype)
 */
 case class CHECK_CAST(typ: TypeKind) extends Instruction {
```

This behavior can be fixed by using `keepend` option when defining `scalaDocComment` group.
The `keepend` option keeps the contained matches from going past the end pattern defined by the containing region.
