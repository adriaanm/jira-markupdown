A small behavioural bug with remote actors. When sending messages to a RemoteActor which is not yet live, TcpService cannot connect and buffers messages. When a connection is formed, TcpService sends the message that prompted the connect(), and then drains the buffer.

Messages arrive at the sink in LIFO order, rather than FIFO order, which may break developer's assumptions on how queue handling works.

I have attached a diff from my local copy of the SVN tree that solves the problem.

Steps to reproduce follow. Given this code:

{code}
import scala.actors._
import scala.actors.Actor._
import scala.actors.remote._
import scala.actors.remote.RemoteActor._

object BasicSourceApp {
  def main(args: Array[String]) : Unit = {
    if (args.length == 2) {
      val remoteport = args(1).toInt
      val peer = Node(args(0), remoteport)
      val source = new RemoteSource(peer)
      source.start()
    }
    else {
      println("usage: scala BasicSourceApp [RemoteHostName] [RemotePort]")
    }
  }
}

class RemoteSource(peer: Node) extends Actor {
  def act() {
    RemoteActor.classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader()
    val sink = select(peer, 'SinkApp)
	var counter = 0
    link(sink)

    while (true) {
	  println("Sending... "+counter)
      sink ! counter.toString

	  counter += 1
      Thread sleep 500
    }
  }
}

object BasicSinkApp {
  def main(args: Array[String]) : Unit = {
    if (args.length == 1) {
      val port = args(0).toInt
      val sink = new RemoteSink(port)
      sink.start()
    }
    else {
      println("usage: scala BasicSinkApp [LocalPort]")
    }
  }
}

class RemoteSink(port: Int) extends Actor {
  RemoteActor.classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader()
  def act() {
    alive(port)
    register('SinkApp, self)

    while (true) {
      receive {
        case msg =>
          println(msg)
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}

First run: {{scala BasicSourceApp localhost 55000}}

Wait a few seconds for some messages to be sent, then in another terminal, run: {{scala BasicSinkApp 55000}}


=== Expected behavior ===

For messages sent prior to running BasicSinkApp to have been dropped and therefore not arrive, or for messages to arrive in order.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Messages arrive in reverse order.

=== Solution ===

The fix is a slight tweak in TcpService. I have attached a diff that solves the problem.
