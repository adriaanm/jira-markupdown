As defined in Syntax Summary and start of Chapter 6:

{code}
  ResultExpr ::= Expr1
               | (Bindings | Id ‘:’ CompoundType) ‘=>’ Block
{code}

However in Section 6.23 (Anonymous Functions) the second alternative is defined as:

{code}
  ResultExpr ::= (Bindings | Id [‘:’ CompoundType]) ‘=>’ Block
{code}

I think the latter is correct.

----

Also in 6.23 this appears as 'Expr1'

{code}
  Expr1 ::= (Bindings | Id) ‘=>’ Expr
{code}

However elsewhere this definition is part of 'Expr'

{code}
  Expr ::= [(Bindings | Id) ‘=>’] Expr
         | Expr1
{code}

So I think the 'Expr1' in 6.23 should be 'Expr'

Finally a question: why is it not 

{code}
  Expr ::= (Bindings | Id [':' CompoundType]) ‘=>’ Expr
{code}
