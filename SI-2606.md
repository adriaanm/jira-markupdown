2.7.7:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.7.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
scala> List(1).isInstanceOf[List[String]]
warning: there were unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details

{code}

trunk two weeks ago:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r19281-b20091026023411 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).

{code}

trunk today:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r19460-b20091109085801 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
scala> List(1).isInstanceOf[List[String]]       
res1: Boolean = true
{code}

I'm guessing this happened as an unintended side effect of r19453 (and there was no test coverage
to catch the regression).

reopened SI-2517
well, Martin closed SI-2517, but the test case in this ticket isn't fixed, so I'm reopening this one. I suggest treating them as separate tickets since the test cases and failure modes are different (and both test cases should be in the test suite)
I think it's fixed:

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r0-b20091113160310 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> List(1).isInstanceOf[List[String]]      
warning: there were unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
res0: Boolean = true
{code}

please reopen if I'm missing something
my mistake â€” I apologize.

I hope the test case made it into the suite, though? test/files/run/t493.scala (SI-493) and test/pending/run/t0727.scala (SI-727) look related, though 0727 is marked as pending (should it be moved out now that new arrays are in?), and I don't know partest well enough to know whether the presence/absence of compiler warnings is checked for.
