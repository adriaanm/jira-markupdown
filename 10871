It regressed between 2.10.2 and 2.10.3. Bisecting is tricky, because, in this range, it both flailed between compiling and not-compiling and running and not-running. Another reason I don't think we should treat it as a blocker for 2.11.0.
```scala
g bisect start
g bisect good v2.10.2
g bisect bad v2.10.3
g bisect run scala-run-head /Users/adriaan/Desktop/Bugs/t8431.scala

    SI-7638 Superaccessor lookup after specialization

I mean "regression" as in change in behavior. The above patch may very well be correct and an improvement (it compiles!), but likely revealed mixins was not prepared with the corner case in this ticket.
```scala
# scala-run-head
#!/bin/bash
rev=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
tmpBisect="$(mktemp -d -t bisect)"
cd "$tmpBisect" && RUNNER=scalac scala-hash $rev $@ || exit 0 # ignore compiler errors, which muddy the waters further in this case
scala-hash $rev Test
```
