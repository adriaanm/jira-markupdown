> You've misunderstood it:

I don't think so. I got that you have to write that. I am only saying, people would expect to have to write

{code}
val xs = (1 to 3).map { i => q"val ${TermName("foo" + i)}: Int" }
q"f(implicit ..$xs)"
{code}

But have to write
{code}
val xs = (1 to 3).map { i => q"implicit val ${TermName("foo" + i)}: Int" }
q"f(..$xs)"
{code}

which is not intuitive because it differs from the way you write it in Scala. But I am sure you have good reasons for this syntactic departure.
