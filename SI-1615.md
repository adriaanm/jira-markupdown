"scaladoc -access private" does not show this class:

private[mypackage] class A

In general - all classes, methods or fields with the private[*] modifiers (e.g. private[this]) are not included in the generated documentation.
can I also request that the ant task now support the access attribute.

```scala
BUILD FAILED
/home/mbana/workspace/x/build.xml:106: scaladoc doesn't support the "access" attribute
```
Original no longer applicable to Scaladoc 2, updated request duplicate of #3807.
