To follow up to Philipp's above list, I believe that all which remains is documentation-related.

- More docs (if you meant API comments, I actually think we're OK on docs...)
- SIP-14 spec needs to be updated to reflect Try-based signature change
- The specific members/entities which need improved/corrected documentation in scala/bug#6099
