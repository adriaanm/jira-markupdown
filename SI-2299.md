this started with r18589 and it appears from the comments to the commit that Martin is aware of the problem. nonetheless, I thought there should be a ticket.
Still present in r18652. It seems tied to the new array implementation, so directing the ticket to Martin.
Please reassign to scala_meeting if it requires more detailed discussion.
