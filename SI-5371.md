To quote:

{{flatMap}}
bq. Builds a new collection by applying a function to all elements of this $coll and concatenating the results.

{{flatten}}
bq. Converts this $coll of traversable collections into a $coll in which all element collections are concatenated.

This strong suggests that these methods are equivalent to {{reduceLeft(_ ++ _)}}, in that the type of the result depends on the type of the elements, not the type of {{$coll}}.
