I write a (java) class name that is not yet imported and get a squiggly line. I then hit ctrl-shift-m to create an import. An error dialog pops with the message:
AST must not be null

The file has been compiled before.

  Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r20585-b20100119041018	ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.feature.group
I can verify this happens with 2.8.0.r21649-b20100422035237 as well.

The same action fails if the class is fully qualified as well, i.e. running Organise Imports (Ctrl + Shift + O) or Add Import (Ctrl + Shift + M) on the following
{code}
var pattern: java.util.regex.Pattern;
{code}
results in the same error.
