Yep, its as I suspected:
```
public class com.aldebaran.proxy.Variant
  SourceFile: "Variant.java"
  InnerClasses:
       public static final #44= #43 of #31; //typeV=class com/aldebaran/proxy/Variant$typeV of class com/aldebaran/proxy/Variant
  minor version: 0
```

Not sure why Variant$typeV is missing from that JAR. I've googled around for similar problems with SWIG, but nothing obvious appears. Maybe you could check on a SWIG mailing list?

How does this work with javac? As a workaround, you could create a Java wrapper class manually for Variant, and refer to that from Scala. So long as scalac never needs to load Variant.class, you will be able to compile.

I'll leave this open pending a report of how javac works. Maybe we can demote the error to a warning.
