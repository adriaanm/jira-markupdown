scala> List(Some(1), None, Some(2)).flatten

<console>:5: error: could not find implicit value for parameter asArray: (Option[Int]) => Array[U]

It looks like arrays can only flatten other arrays, or things which can be implicitly converted to arrays (which isn't much of anything I think.) I am not sure why it operates on arrays and not traversables.  I suppose given the fact that you can't overload on the implicit parameter and that Arrays are no longer Traversables, it's an either/or decision unless some way is devised to say asSomething: A => Traversable[B] or Array[B]...


flexibility will cost you a ClassManifest, methinks:

{code}
  def flatten[U, To](implicit asTrav: T => collection.Traversable[U], m: ClassManifest[U]): Array[U] = {
    val b = Array.newBuilder[U]
    b.sizeHint(map{case is: IndexedSeq[_] => is.size case _ => 0} sum)
     for (xs <- this) b ++= asTrav(xs)
     b.result
   }
{code}
(In r22797) closes SI-2788. flatten now works for arrays of traversables, not just arrays of arrays

the added flexibility'll cost ya one ClassManifest
