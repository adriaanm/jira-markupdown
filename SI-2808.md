Given the definitions:

trait A { def foo: string = "foo" }
trait B { self: A => override def foo: string = "bar" }

class C extends A with B

scala gives the error:

error: overriding method foo in trait A of type => String;
 method foo in trait B of type => String cannot override a concrete member without a third member that's overridden by both (this rule is designed to prevent ``accidental overrides_)
       class C extends A with B
             ^

Since methods of self-types can now be overridden (spec will soon be updated to reflect this), the accidental override error should not be given in this case.
(In r20186) Fixed #2808. Review by odersky.
(In r24706) Fixes #2808 without redefining what override means. Review by extempore.
