Could be because the file is not in git or could be because my commits broke something. Need to investigate.
This doesn't seem to still be the case. (That is, I'm assuming you're referring to the contents of [src/library/rootdoc.txt](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/library/rootdoc.txt) being displayed). Probably OK to close this one.
