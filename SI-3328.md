I just noticed that the description of {{scala.xml.Node's}}
(from http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/rc-api/index.html)
{code}
 def   \(that: String): NodeSeq
{code}

and 
{code}
 def   \\(that: String): NodeSeq   
{code}
are almost identical. I think it should be added that {{\\}} recursively returns any child nodes.

Furthermore, there seems to be a small typo in the description of {{\\}}:

{code}
Similar to XPath, use this \\ 'foo to get a list of all elements
{code}
should read 
{code}
Similar to XPath, use this \\ "foo" to get a list of all elements
{code}
