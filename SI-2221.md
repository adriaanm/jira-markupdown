object test {
  
    def g(v:(Int)=>Unit):Unit = v(3)
    
    def h = g(println(_.toString))

}

fails to compile with the following error :
missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$$1) => x$$1.toString)

Should the compiler not be able to infer that _ can only be an Int, given g signature ?
your example expands to
{code}
g(println(x => x.toString))
{code}
which does not type check.

since you just filed three invalid tickets, here's a friendly advice: if you are not absolutely sure about a bug, do your research and/or consult the mailing lists before creating a ticket (and using time of the core-developers).
Scalding comment.

I will then leave you and *I urge you to close my account here* as I have no wish to participate any more in a community that doesn't seem to value the input of professionals who actually put new technologies in use in the industry. My time is at least as precious as yours, as I'm not get paid for investigating scala and am doing this in overtime.

As for cases 2210 and 2219, they actually should have been left open but retyped as "language enhacements" rather than closed and left as "computer defect". I won't bother doing this anyway.
