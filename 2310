It is a duplicate of SI-1787, yes.  You'd think it'd be a simpler matter to call .toString() automatically, but because of curse-inducingly poorly considered semantics, you will end up with Strings like "Some(5)" where you would currently receive "5".  The correct fix requires breaking the current interface which means it has to wait.
