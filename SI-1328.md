I suggest adding

{code}
   def indices = new Range(0, size,1)
{code}

to _Seq_ and removing it from _Array_. 
Otherwise it would become incompatible, but _array.indices.toArray_ does the same so I think one can live with it.

If compatibility is a must I suggest adding the following instead:
{code}
   def indices : Seq = new Range(0, size,1)
{code}
and using the override modifier for _Array_. This enhancement is not so nice, since to get the _Range_ one has to call _array.projection.indices_.
