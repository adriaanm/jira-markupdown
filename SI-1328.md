I suggest adding

```scala
   def indices = new Range(0, size,1)
```

to *Seq* and removing it from *Array*. 
Otherwise it would become incompatible, but *array.indices.toArray* does the same so I think one can live with it.

If compatibility is a must I suggest adding the following instead:
```scala
   def indices : Seq = new Range(0, size,1)
```
and using the override modifier for *Array*. This enhancement is not so nice, since to get the *Range* one has to call *array.projection.indices*.
