They are not equivalent.

In:
```scala
  implicit class IntToMultiplier(val int: Int) {
    def intToMultiplier: Multiplier = Multiplier(int)
  }
```

The only implicit conversion created is from `Int => IntToMultiplier`.

Implicit classes are designed for the Extension Method pattern. You are using implicits instead to convert from one type to another, which requires use of implicit defs (and is subject to a warning because it sacrifices some typesafety).
