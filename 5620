Of course, I must respect your decision.
Where will Scala converts some from? Wait a generation for
new programmers to be trained or from existing Java
programmers. I have always argued that Scala is a better Java;
setting aside Scala's functional half, its just a better Java. 
Now, in the case of post-construction behavior, Scala
will be just like Java, error prone at best.
I do not believe that the limitations of Java should
be the measure for Scala:
"If it makes sense to add it to Scala why has it not been added to Java?"
Oh well ...
