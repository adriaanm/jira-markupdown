{code: title=Example}
    object Main extends App {
      val iterations = 1000000000
      
      private def slowtime(fn: => Unit) = -(System.nanoTime - {fn; System.nanoTime}) / 1000000
      
      private def time(fn: => Unit) = {
        val start = System.nanoTime
        fn
        (System.nanoTime - start) / 1000000
      }
      
      var i = 0
      
      println(time(while(i < iterations) {i += 1}))
      
      
      i = 0
      
      //comment out this line to improve performance with -optimize
      println(slowtime{while(i < iterations) {i += 1}})
    }

This snippet of code produces code that is in the worse case over 1000x  slower after the optimizer is finished with it. In the best case it produces code that is only 53x slower. Commenting out the last two lines results in the optimizer producing code that is 1:1 with standard scalac output bytecode.
This pathology can be reduced to
{code}
object Main {
  private def f(body: => Unit): Unit = body
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = println(f(0 to 1000000000 foreach (_ => ())))
}
{code}
The inlining of the Range defeats on-stack replacement - "COMPILE SKIPPED: OSR starts with non-empty stack (not retryable)" - and when you see "COMPILE SKIPPED" a 1000x slowdown starts to look pretty good.

Symptomatic workarounds:

a) @noinline annotation on the private method
b) scalac -Ydelambdafy:method -optimise
c) A less sucky Range class, like this one. https://github.com/paulp/scala/blob/5732b9a7/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/IntRange.scala
