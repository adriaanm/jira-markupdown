One more to test (I'll check it tonight if noone beats me to it)

{code}
scala> class X[T](val i: T) extends AnyVal
defined class X

scala> (new { def y[T, XT <: X[T]](xt: XT) = xt.i }).y[Int, X[Int]](new X(0))
java.lang.VerifyError: (class: , method: <init> signature: ()V) Expecting to find object/array on stack
{code}

UPDATE:

This example work fine. The error I was seeing was from an older milestone, M5.
