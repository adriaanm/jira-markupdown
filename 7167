The bug manifests itself even if the entire thing is in an empty package. Also, enabling -uniqid in settings has provided sort of more accurate error message

{code}
scala.reflect.internal.Types$TypeError: type mismatch;
 found   : Test2.CoffeesTable#1915 => Boolean#196
 required: Test2#1910.CoffeesTable#1915 => Boolean#196
