"val (a,b) = 1" in fact fails to compile.

"val (a,b) = 1: Any" is pretty strange code. The ": Any" tells the compiler, "forget
everything you know about this expression, just treat it as Any".  Then when compilation
succeeds, it's a little funny to complain that the compiler didn't use its knowledge of
what "1" is, when you explicitly told it not to.

Why I would be using practically useless, vague types like Any and Product anyway...?

I'm not critiquing your overall goals here, I'm just saying you need more compelling
use cases if you want to build support for changes in this area.
