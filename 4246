Going to say RC3 is correct.  Buffer is not and cannot be covariant, and it has no basis for assuming Buffer(new B) has any type but Buffer[B].  Do this:
```scala
Buffer[A](new B)
```
And thank the compiler for making you do it explicitly, since I find myself burned far more often by the cases where it does do this (e.g. assuming you mean List[Any] because you accidentally threw a wrong type in there.)
