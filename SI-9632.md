The implementation of the ZipArchive abstract file backend

https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/reflect/scala/reflect/io/ZipArchive.scala

never releases the streams to jar files that it is opening as part of providing the classpath to the compiler and (more importantly) interactive compiler.

This is not so bad on Linux, it's just wasteful, but on Windows it can be really bad as the OS locks the file and does not allow it to be deleted.

The effect is that if the user's IDE (or in my case ENSIME) is using the user's jars as the classpath definition, then the build tool (in my case, sbt in exportJars mode) cannot delete / replace the jars. The result to the end user is that the build tool is a no-op.

The problem can be fixed by releasing references to the jar file.

I am currently looking for a workaround that we can implement within ENSIME to alleviate the problem *now* for our users.
I just tried something new, which I think might avoid the need to copy files.

This was enough to auto-close in a direct "unit test" of this class:

I confirmed with {{lsof}} that this the file was closed.

However, when I tried:

{{lsof}} reported that the file was still open. I took a quick look with {{YourKit}}-s file system probes, but I didn't find any record of closes or opens of that file, which probably means I was using the tool incorrectly.

Hopefully this gives you a starting point.

I think this ticket is a duplicate of SI-5207. I'm going to close that one as a duplicate of this one.
I was using the "events" tab of YourKit, which does show File open/read/write/close events, with stack traces at each of them. But I didn't spot events for the JAR I was testing against at all.

You can always put your own version of {{FileZipFileArchive.class}} ahead of {{scala-reflect.jar}} in the JVM classpath of Ensime if you want to "monkeypatch" in a new version.
[~retronym] great, thanks!! :)

Your code seems pretty sensible, but I'm a bit confused by {{lsof}} claiming the file is closed and then open...
So I've spent a bit of time attempting to write automated tests for this. Using [~retronym]'s change as a starting point (the "make it work" flag is really useful for testing, but I'm guessing no one wants to keep it like that) it's easy enough to create tests that will fail on Windows.... but pass on unix.

Does anyone have any advice on how to check if a file is open in general? I know it's one of those annoying java problems, but expected to find something clever in the tests around io.Source (which I can't). Right now I'm assuming that's because they ran into exactly this problem and decided it had to be tested manually.

I'll keep working on this over the next day or so, but so you can see roughly what I'm trying to add to {{ZipArchiveTest}}

{code:scala}

  @Test
  def closeFile: Unit = {
    System.setProperty("scala.classpath.closezip", "true")

    val f = createTempZipFile
    val fza = new FileZipArchive(createTempZipFile)

    fza.iterator

    System.clearProperty("scala.classpath.closezip")

    assertTrue(f.canWrite) // ie File is closed (on Windows)

    f.delete
  }

  @Test
  def leaveFileOpen: Unit = {
    val f = createTempZipFile
    val fza = new FileZipArchive(f)

    fza.iterator

    assertFalse(f.canWrite) // ie File is still open (on Windows anyway)
  }

  def createTempZipFile = {
    val f = JFile.createTempFile("test", ".zip")
    val zf = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(f))
    zf.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry("data"))
    zf.close()
    f
  }
