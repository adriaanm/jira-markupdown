The sample is scala API itself. Take a look at
[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/annotation/target/package.html the target package] and its classes (so called meta annotations). They are introduced just as a hint to which element of a definition compiler shall apply annotation. However, compiler makes now checks is this appliance valid or not.

Here the "classical" example is ctor annotation. Most people write

{code}
@annot
class MyClass(a: A) {}
{code}
instead of 
{code}
class MyClass @annot()(a: A) {}
{code}

and compiler gives even no warning despite that annotation has ctor @target. I understand that this case completely depends on language knowledge and developer's attention, but all people have mistakes and it's compiler's job to detect as many as possible.
