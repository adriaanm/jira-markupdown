classOf[java.lang.Integer] gets compiled to something like:

{code}
   0:   getstatic       SI-38; //Field class$$Cache0:Ljava/lang/Class;
   3:   ifnonnull       14
   6:   ldc     SI-40; //String java.lang.Integer
   8:   invokestatic    SI-46; //Method java/lang/Class.forName:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Class;
   11:  putstatic       SI-38; //Field class$$Cache0:Ljava/lang/Class;
   14:  getstatic       SI-38; //Field class$$Cache0:Ljava/lang/Class;
{code}

while Java's java.lang.Integer.class is compiled to the much simpler code:

{code}
   3:   ldc_w   SI-3; //class java/lang/Integer
{code}

Seems like Java's way of compilation of getting class object works faster.
What I meant here was that if you pass "-target:jvm-1.5" you get the desired behavior.

Replying to [comment:1 dragos]:
> Class literal constants are generated only when the target is jvm-1.5, otherwise it's the workaround cited by the OP. I believe java does the same thing.
