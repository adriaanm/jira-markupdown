Using Scala Eclipse Plugin   2.8.0.r20214-b20091218041230    

Importing the attached project into a blank workspace I can

1) Right click on App.scala -> Run As -> Scala Application -> The app
prints Hello World
2) Right click on the class SimpleUnitTest -> Run As -> JUnit Test ->
Error dialog "The input type of the launch configuration does not
exist"

If I then do 

 1. Select your project
 1. Go to "Build Path / Configure Build Path"
 1. In the "Libraries" tab, "Add Class Folder"
 1. In the "Class Folder Selection" dialog, do "Create New Folder"
 1. In the "New Folder" dialog, select "Advanced" and "Link to folder in the file system"
 1. Select the output folder of your project 

I can then launch the unit test correctly in step 2)
