Welcome to Scala version 2.7.3.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.5.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val & = "abc"
&: java.lang.String = abc

scala> &
     | ;
<console>:2: error: illegal start of simple expression
       ;
       ^

scala> val x = &
     | ;
<console>:2: error: illegal start of simple expression
       ;
       ^

scala> $$amp
res0: java.lang.String = abc
{code}

(Assigning to myself, ticket for my reference.)
This behaves differently now.  & works:
{code}
scala> val & = "abc"
&: java.lang.String = abc

scala> &
res0: java.lang.String = abc

scala> val x = &
x: java.lang.String = abc
{code}

But ! doesn't, and with backticks at least it really should:

{code}
scala> val ! = 5  
!: Int = 5

scala> !
     | ;
<console>:2: error: illegal start of simple expression
       ;
       ^

scala> val x = !;
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple expression
       val x = !;
                ^

scala> val x = `!`;
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple expression
       val x = `!`;
                  ^

scala> val `!` = 10
!: Int = 10
{code}

This works in a pinch:

{code}
scala> $$bang
res2: Int = 10

scala> val p = $$bang
p: Int = 10
{code}

Lowering priority.
I'm not sure what the interpreter has to do with this.

{code}
object Tilde {
  val ~ = 5
  println(~)
}
{code}

{code}
yuvi@types$ scalac Tilde.scala 
Tilde.scala:3: error: illegal start of simple expression
  println(~)
           ^
Tilde.scala:4: error: ')' expected but '}' found.
}
^
two errors found
{code}

As I noted in a comment above yours, albeit perhaps unclearly, it is not an interpreter issue per se, but the way it manifests in the repl is more of a problem because you cannot easily work around it with the full path when the full path involves a secret hidden object.
{noformat}
scala> object ~ { val x = 5 }
defined module $tilde
scala> ~.x
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple expression
       ~.x
        ^
// can't really expect people to figure this one out
scala> $line27.$read.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.$iw.~.x
res4: Int = 5
{noformat}
I think you could quite easily fix the parser so that it would accept +,-,~,! as identifiers as a simple expression. However, that wouldn't be usable in many cases because this introduces a possible ambiguity between a name being meant as a prefix operator or as an identifier.

E.g. what should be the meaning of 

{code}
val + = 12
+ + + // should that mean (+).+(+) or the invalid (+ +).+
{code}

I'm calling wontfix since it seems to be of limited scope.
I suspect people experimenting in the repl would either chose a different name or put the one-who-shall-not-be-referenced-without-prefix in a prefix that can be written down:

{code}
scala> object foo { object ~ }
defined module foo

scala> foo.~
res4: foo.~.type = foo$$tilde$@560e018a
{code}

Community, feel free to reopen (preferable with a pull request in hand).
The examples work now.

The triple plus is not invalid:
{code}
scala> val + = 12
+: Int = 12

scala> + + +
<console>:9: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method + in class Int of type (x: Char)Int
and  method + in class Int of type (x: Byte)Int
match expected type ?
              + + +
                  ^

scala> val f: Int => Int = + + +
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
f: Int => Int = <function1>
{code}
The rule is that it takes the first plus in the traditional way if it can.
