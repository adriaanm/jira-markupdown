lazy vals highlighted as vars. Probably inheriting from vals o defs is more expected.
The original behaviour (highlighting lazy vals as vars) is definitely wrong. Highlighting them as vals is clearly better and addresses the original report.

Still, as I mentioned when I closed this, it might be preferable to have a separate category for lazy vals. Be my guest and create a fresh enhancement ticket for that. A patch would also be very welcome.
Have no idea why to multiply tickets :-) Ok, #1706 is created.
