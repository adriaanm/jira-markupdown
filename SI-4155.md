=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
scala> Double.MinValue
<console>:6: warning: method MinValue in object Double is deprecated: use Double.MinNegativeValue instead
       Double.MinValue
              ^
res0: Double = -1.7976931348623157E308
```

This appeared in the current 2.9.0 trunk a while ago.
Additionally MinNegativeValue and MinPositiveValue were added.


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Double's (and Float's) MinValue should not be deprecated, because it is consitent with integer types like Int.MinValue and Long.MinValue.

While the current naming is a change to Java's naming it actually improved the consistency within numeric types.

I suggest removing MinNegativeValue again and moving MinPositiveValue to better name (maybe "SmallestValue").
The current naming creates the impression that there is an relationship between those two fields like MinNegativeValue == -MinPositiveValue, which is false.

=== What do you see instead? ===

The naming has regressed to an level of inconsistency below Java's.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r23982-b20110114020143
  - Java: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.10
