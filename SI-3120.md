I have this Java class with inner class:

MyClassWithInner.java:

```scala
public class MyClassWithInner {
    public class MyInnerClass {}
}
```

Then another Java class using MyInnerClass:

MyBaseJavaClass.java:

```scala
public class MyBaseJavaClass {
    public void passInner(MyClassWithInner.MyInnerClass myInner) {}
}
```

Finally, this Scala class:

MyDerivedScalaClass.scala:

```scala
class MyDerivedScalaClass extends MyBaseJavaClass {
    override def passInner(myInner: MyClassWithInner#MyInnerClass) = {}
}
```

Compiling:

scalac scala/*.scala java/*.java

java/MyBaseJavaClass.java:2: error: not found: value MyClassWithInner
    public void passInner(MyClassWithInner.MyInnerClass myInner) {}

Same result with 2.7.7 and 2.8.0.Beta1.

Sorry, I was going to open this, hadn't gotten to it.  Here is the issue.  Observe these classes:
```scala
public class J1 {
  public class Inner1 { }
  public static class Inner2 { }
}
public class J2 {
  public void f1(J1.Inner1 p) { }
  public void f2(J1.Inner2 p) { }
}
public class Q {
  public void passInner(J1.Inner1 myInner) {}
}
```
When scala parses the method signatures in J2, it treats them as member selections.  In scala we write J1.Inner1 for the static version and J1#Inner1 for the instance, but java offers no such crutch.  The reason I couldn't dash off an easy fix is that at the parsing stage it doesn't yet know which it is.

In JavaParsers I could do this:
```scala
- Select(qual, name.toTypeName)
+ SelectFromTypeTree(convertToTypeId(qual), name.toTypeName)
```
and in fact that fixes this bug, but then breaks anything that needed the guess to go the other way.  So I will need some input on how to defer it long enough to obtain the type information.
(In r21157) Closes #3120. Review by extempore.
