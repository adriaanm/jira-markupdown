Judging from the lack of strong reactions against getting rid of this item in https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/q1YX7NC1geM/discussion I think we can create an issue to track it.

```scala
trait Foo { def foo }
abstract Bar { def bar }
```

The fact that this is accepted by the compiler is incredibly surprising, because it goes against the intuition that the compiler needs either a body to infer the type or an explicit type annotation.

Adding to the unintuitiveness is that in most cases where a type is missing the compiler infers Nothing (for better or worse), but doesn't do it here.

The suggestion is to deprecate the syntax for 2.11 and start requiring a type in 2.12:

```scala
trait Foo { def foo: Unit }
abstract Bar { def bar: Unit }
```

The behaviour is described in chapter 4.6.3 of the spec. Getting rid of this special-cased behaviour would allow getting rid of the whole chapter.

I don't think https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2604 was merged, and I can't find a follow up PR.
Rescheduling for 2.11.1-RC1, but feel free to fix my oversight, note the PR that fixes this and mark it as fixed.
Please use the same approach as in #7629,  where issues correspond to work items, so that we can close the issue that corresponds to a PR when it's merged. This is the only way we stand a chance at keeping jira in synch with github.

I think these warnings are really important, so I just want to make sure we don't forget about them / include them properly in the release notes.
