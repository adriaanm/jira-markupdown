@Jason Yes, the {{A[_ <: B]}} seems to be natural for Dotty. For current Scala, the existential interpretation gets in the way. 

Problem with collections: Indeed, collections use the F-bounded pattern systematically and pervasively. E.g.
{code}
  class List[T] extends .... LinearSeqOptimized[T, List[T]]
{code}
But these recursive occurrences are covariant. So a translation to
{code}
   class List[T] extends .... LinearSeqOptimized[T, _ <: List[T]]
{code}
looks feasible (although I have not tried it).
