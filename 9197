@Jason Yes, the `A[_ <: B]` seems to be natural for Dotty. For current Scala, the existential interpretation gets in the way. 

Problem with collections: Indeed, collections use the F-bounded pattern systematically and pervasively. E.g.
```scala
  class List[T] extends .... LinearSeqOptimized[T, List[T]]
```
But these recursive occurrences are covariant. So a translation to
```scala
   class List[T] extends .... LinearSeqOptimized[T, _ <: List[T]]
```
looks feasible (although I have not tried it).
