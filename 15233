I just noticed that the description of `scala.xml.Node's`
(from http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/rc-api/index.html)
```scala
 def   \(that: String): NodeSeq
```

and 
```scala
 def   \\(that: String): NodeSeq   
```
are almost identical. I think it should be added that `\\` recursively returns any child nodes.

Furthermore, there seems to be a small typo in the description of `\\`:
```scala
Similar to XPath, use this \\ 'foo to get a list of all elements
```
should read 
```scala
Similar to XPath, use this \\ "foo" to get a list of all elements
```
