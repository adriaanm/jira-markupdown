According to scala spec we have two following syntax endpoints that start with `val` keyword:

{noformat}
Dcl               ::=  `val' ValDcl | ...
ValDcl            ::=  ids `:' Type

PatVarDef         ::=  `val' PatDef | ...
PatDef            ::=  Pattern2 {`,' Pattern2} [`:' Type] `=' Expr
{noformat}

From here it's easy to see that val followed by a parenthesis can only mean a pattern which implies runtime type check rather than current compile-time one.
