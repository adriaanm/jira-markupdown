Add a convenient method RichString.dropRight(n: Int)

e.g.

scala> "123" dropRight 1
res0: scala.runtime.RichString = 12


This should be part of the new collections library redesign that Martin is working on. Please look at https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/branches/devel-base-2.8.0/src/library/scalax for at snapshot of the new work.
