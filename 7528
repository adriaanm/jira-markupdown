But the quoted text is an observation on the *default* implementation of serial UID.

Considering the prevalence of case objects **and the fact they are by default `Serializable`**, I would expect a *sensible* implementation, *not the default implementation*. The sensible implementation for the serial UID of a singleton is a pure function of its "path".

If I'd had to mark it as `Serializable` myself, I would (of course) agree with you.
