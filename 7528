But the quoted text is an observation on the _default_ implementation of serial UID.

Considering the prevalence of case objects *and the fact they are by default {{Serializable}}*, I would expect a _sensible_ implementation, _not the default implementation_. The sensible implementation for the serial UID of a singleton is a pure function of its "path".

If I'd had to mark it as {{Serializable}} myself, I would (of course) agree with you.
