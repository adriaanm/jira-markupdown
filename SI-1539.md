I am using a Java library called Jersey in Scala:

  http://jersey.dev.java.net
 
If i refer to the WebResource class:

  https://jersey.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/jersey/tags/jersey-1.0/api/jersey/com/sun/jersey/api/client/WebResource.html

for example:

{code}
class Foo {
    var r : WebResource = _
}
{code}

then the Scala compiler fails with:

{code}
[WARNING] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: internal error: illegal class file dependency
[WARNING]         at scala.Predef$$.assert(Predef.scala:92)

{code}

Attached is a simple maven project that reproduces the error. To reproduce using Maven 2.0.9 and do mvn clean test.
Here is the minimal error producing case:
{code}
// A.java
interface Inter<T> { }

public class A implements Inter<A.Inner> {  
  public class Inner { };
}
{code}
Now reference A from scala and see the crash.  As you can surely see from the test case, it's a result of a class parameterizing an implemented interface with its own inner class.  I am not sure I will look further at this anytime soon, so if someone wants to run with that info, please feel free.
Same here, blocked on this.  It is one of the few edge cases where I still need to write Java :-(

> Any plans to have this fixed for 2.8. For the past 8 months i am blocked from using the Jersey client API with Scala :-(

There's ticket SI-2433 for that (this one is fixed and a test case is in the test suite, so no regression here). In order to keep things well organized, please add any additional information you may have under the relevant ticket.

FYI SI-2896 was introduced in r18616.
