First, if we can get this little part fixed so that the check does what it's supposed to do, I have a workaround for the larger problem.

Now, I figured out what's wrong with the current fix; I just don't know how to fix it.

The static check added can't tell if classes defined in other translation units are serializable or not. Or rather, the symtable doesn't keep track of classes' annotations that it's not currently generating. What's needed is for the check to actually look for the classes and check their annotations. I don't know nearly enough to do this myself.

Thanks!
