Scala 2.7.2 final produces invalid parsing errors when loading a file into an interactive shell. This happens when either an object or a class definition has a newline between the `id` and the `TemplateBody`'s opening curly brace.

Let's say we have the following code in a file called `Foo.scala`:
{code}
object Foo
{
    def bar = 0
}
{code}

When we load `Foo.scala` by running `scala -i Foo.scala`, the parsing fails, causing an error:
{code}
<console>:3: error: block must end in result expression, not in definition
{code}

After removing one newline character, the following code works:
{code}
object Foo {
    def bar = 0
}
{code}
But when running either version directly with the scala interpreter - as in `scala Foo.scala` - they both work.


Running with -i and :load is intended to simulate what would happen if the file specified were entered in at the interactive shell.  Given that, this is the expected behavior.

For what you are after you should just run
{code}
% scalac Foo.scala
% scala
