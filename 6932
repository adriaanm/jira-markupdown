My whole point in opening this ticket was that more rigorous performance tests be done to determine whether changing the default implementation would make sense. If those tests have already been done, great, just point me to where the results are summarized and I'll shut up. :) If they haven't been done, why was this closed as wontfix?

It looks like Ismael has already done some testing - Ismael - can you explain what the numbers in the table mean in the link you gave? You did not actually explain that anywhere in your message. :) Either OpenHashMap was significantly worse for this benchmark, or significantly better... Besides that randomized search test what other tests did you do and can you summarize your general results?
