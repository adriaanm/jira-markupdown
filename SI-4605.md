When I compile finalval.scala with content:
{code}
object A {
   final val c = 1234
}
{code}
an unused private attribute "private final int c;" in A$$.class is created (JD-GUI output):[[BR]]
[[BR]]

Scala version was 2.9.0.final
java compiler version was 1.6.0_18
In the reported case, we could potentially avoid creating the field. In
addition there is the "final val vs. val" issue covered in the following
email excerpt from rex kerr.
{noformat}
Scala knows that it is not a mutable int because it's marked "val". And
furthermore it knows that it won't be overridden because it's in an
object or final class.

The JVM as far as I know doesn't have the level of effect tracking
needed to optimize things _annotated_ as final; there is not any
restriction on bytecode that actually prevents code from writing
multiple times to a "final" field (as far as I can tell from the spec).
In fact, Scala uses this ability when overriding vals--it doesn't
override the method, it instead overwrites the java-private-final value
of the field in the constructor.

So the Scala compiler is the only place where the knowledge exists that
this is a safe optimization.

You don't even have to give up the I-really-am-a-constant vs.
I-am-a-method-masquerading-as-a-constant thing since the JVM is
perfectly well able to elide methods that return a constant. The problem
is that Scala actually stores the value in a field, not that it uses a
method. So if you compare

  object Rng3 {
    val IA = 3877
    val IC = 29573
    var last = 42
    def next = { last = (last*IA + IC); last }
  }

  object Rng4 {
    final val IA = 3877
    final val IC = 29573
    var last = 42
    def next = { last = (last*IA + IC); last }
  }
  object Rng8 {
    def IA = 3877
    def IC = 29573
    var last = 42
    def next = { last = (last*IA + IC); last }
  }

you find that the performance is identical for 4 and 8. In the Rng4 case
the constants are pushed into the next method, but in Rng8 the code for
next is bytecode-identical to that for Rng3. The difference is

// Rng3 -- val
public int IA();
  Code:
   0:    aload_0
   1:    getfield    #20; //Field IA:I
   4:    ireturn

// Rng8 -- def
public int IA();
  Code:
   0:    sipush    3877
   3:    ireturn

and in the former case, the JVM is, as far as I know, powerless to elide
the field access.

Scala meeting: is there a reason we must generate the field? Not generating the field would cure this and SI-4742.
By the way, there are two incorrect statements in Rex's email:

"it doesn't override the method, it instead overwrites the java-private-final value of the field in the constructor"

This is not true.

"The JVM as far as I know doesn't have the level of effect tracking
needed to optimize things _annotated_ as final; there is not any
restriction on bytecode that actually prevents code from writing
multiple times to a "final" field (as far as I can tell from the spec)."

Not true again. David Homes, a HotSpot committer, says:

"So the compiler can optimize away re-loading of final fields, even if
reflection (or Unsafe) is mis-used. (Though compilation of deserialization
code would have to be handled specially.)"

This bug makes it impossible to expose a stable identifier in a class without creating a useless field. This limitation becomes particularly disheartening when dealing with small objects that implement an interface that exposes a stable identifier (e.g. a vector that exposes its vector space).

An alternative solution might be to permit {{@uncheckedStable}} to apply to defs (wouldn't that open up a nice can of worms?).

Please unburden our precious little stable identifiers from the crushing weight of gc-intensive java fields.
To reinforce Paul's point about fields not serving a useful purpose for Java interop, remember that scalac already elides field definitions for abstract vals.
