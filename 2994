I can reproduce the problem with the following minimized example,

Enum.java
{code}
public enum Enum {
  VALUE;
}
{code}

Ann.java
{code}
public @interface Ann {
  Enum value();
}
{code}

Use.scala
{code}
class Use {
  @Ann(Enum.VALUE)
  def foo {}
}
{code}

And in this case an error is reported by command line scalac,

{code}
src/bug2764/Use.scala:4: error: annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: Enum.VALUE
  @Ann(Enum.VALUE)
            ^
one error found
{code}

So it looks like the Eclipse vs. command-line build issue might be a red-herring.

In both cases scalac is seeing a UniqueConstantType in a context where it's expecting to see a Literal (in Typer.typedAnnotation).
