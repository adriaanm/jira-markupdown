It would be nice if I could ask the repl to javap synthetic artifacts using less than the raw name.

It's possible to do the raw name, by javap -raw Foo to see what the raw names are, and then pasting.

One easy shortcut is to support javap -app Test to mean show me Test$delayedInit$body.

Maybe there are similar mnemonics for anonfuns.
