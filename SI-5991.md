(Using Manifests to avoid interacting with SI-5990.)

{code}
def isItInferableAsATypeArg[A : Manifest](f: A => Unit) = manifest[A]

object Repeated extends ((Int*) => Unit) {
  def apply(x: Int*) {}
}

object ByName extends ((=> Int) => Unit) {
  def apply(x: => Int) {}
}

isItInferableAsATypeArg(Repeated)
{code}

{noformat}
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Repeated.type
 required: Seq[Int] => Unit
{noformat}

Okay, so no then!

{code}
isItInferableAsATypeArg(ByName)
{code}

{noformat}
error: No Manifest available for => Int.
{noformat}

Okay, so yes then?

Somewhere in here is a bug, right?
In total, the solution(s) to SI-4176 leave us in a situation where we can write:

{code}
object Repeater extends ((Int*) => Unit) {
  def apply(x: Int*) {}
}
{code}

but not do much more with it; it is treated as a subtype of {{Seq\[Int\] => Unit}}

More discussion over at SI-6016.

It might be prudent to disallow {{*}} in non method types altogether.

{{=>A}} hasn't suffered the same scrutiny. It remains expressible in function types (and it's pretty commonly used as such):

{code}
scala> def f(a: (=> Any) => Any) = a(???)
f: (a: => Any => Any)Any

scala> f(x => 0)
res1: Any = 0
{code}


Eta expansion retains the by-name-ness:

{code}
scala> def foo(z: Any)(a: => Int) = z
foo: (z: Any)(a: => Int)Any

scala> (foo(0) _)(???)
res2: Any = 0
{code}

So I'm not sure where to take this. If we're going to follow through with the tough stance on {{*}}, we should do it completely. But we should also have a clear story about why we have different rules for {{=>}}.
