In 2.7, both "keys" and "values" returned an Iterator.

The 2.8 collections specification defines new methods "keysIterator" and "valuesIterator" and redefines the original "keys" and "values" methods to return Sets.

However, the actual 2.8 code takes a worst-of-both-worlds approach, deprecating "keys" and "values" but still returning Iterator from both, adding the new "keysIterator" and "valuesIterator" methods with the same functionality, further retaining "keySet" from the original Map API, and adding a new method, "valuesIterable," which as its name suggests, returns an Iterable instead of a Set.

I think that at the least, Map should implement the behavior defined in Martin's collections SID.  Someone reading the SID will reasonably expect the keys and values methods of Map to return Sets.

However I think that "values" should return an Iterable rather than a Set.  After all the values in a Map may not be intended to be used in a Set.  For example we might have a Map of Dates to Users, with each entry representing the state of a User at that point in time.  The User instances are all "equal" from a business key perspective in that they all have the same name;  we just have different snapshots.  But someone calling a Set-returning "values" method would just get back one user.
I think that you're correct about the motivation, but I think that there's plenty going on with the collections that will developers to change code.  I think asking them to make all of the changes now (when they know they're going to have to take a look at their collections usage) is better than essentially **suggesting** a change now (by deprecating the method but keeping the behavior) and then requiring a change later, because with the latter approach, developers who write new code to the 2.8 API now will **also** have to make a change later (when presumably "valuesIterable" will be deprecated and they'll be asked to use "values").
To amplify the above, the policy that makes the most sense to me is, "2.7 code that uses collections may have to change when migrated to 2.8, but code written to the 2.8 API will not need to change when migrating to 2.9."

Right now we have "2.7 code may have to change when migrating to 2.8, and also new 2.8 code may have to change when migrating to 2.9."
Replying to [comment:8 extempore]:
> I interpret that to mean that I can use -Xmigration and restore keys and values to their useful undeprecated status? In that case howdy do, it is A-OK.

Yes. As for their return type - we are probably also going to make `keys` and `values` return sets or iterables, and `*Iterator` return iterators. However, Martin said to assign #3089 to him. I believe he still wants to take a look into it.
(In r21167) Leveraged -Xmigration to burn off some warts which arose in the
new collections.  Warnings put in place for behavioral changes,
allowing the following.  1) Buffers: create new collections on
++ and -- like all the other collections.  2) Maps: eliminated
never-shipped redundant method valuesIterable and supplied these
return types:

  def keys: Iterable[A]
  def keysIterator: Iterator[A]
  def values: Iterable[B]
  def valuesIterator: Iterator[B]
  def keySet: Set[A]

I concluded that keys should return Iterable because keySet
also exists on Map, and is not solely in the province of Maps
even if we wanted to change it: it's defined on Sorted and
also appears in some Sets.  So it seems sensible to have keySet
return a Set and keys return the more general type.

Closes #3089, #3145.  Review by odersky.
