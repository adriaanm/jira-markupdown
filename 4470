FYI, I posted this issue to the mailing list, and Phillip Haller doesn't believe this is a bug, he believes its correct behavior.  Here is a previous thread regarding the issue.  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/28381/

I still think that the default thread pool should grow, as I believe "correct" behavior should trump performance for the default, and only with configuration should you be able to sacrifice correctness for performance.
