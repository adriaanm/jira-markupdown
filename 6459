-sourcepath is also used in the presentation compiler. And it seems pretty standard:
```scala
$ javac -help 2>&1 | grep sourcepath
  -sourcepath <path>         Specify where to find input source files
```

EDIT: regarding the -sourcepath semantics clash in scalac vs scaladoc, the meeting decision was to disable the bootstrapping semantics from sourcepath when running scaladoc. So (still) WON'T FIX, sorry.
