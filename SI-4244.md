If I compile Reactor.scala like so, either all by itself or in concert with other files:

{code}
% scalac -d out1 src/actors/scala/actors/Reactor.scala
% scalac -d out2 src/actors/scala/actors/*.scala
{code}
Then I find the following difference in the bytecode for scala.actors.Reactor$$$$anonfun$$2.
{code}
< const SI-39 = Asciz	(Lscala/actors/Reactor<TMsg;>;)V;
---
> const SI-39 = Asciz	(Lscala/actors/Reactor$$class;)V;
{code}
Of less importance (I think) are these differences in scala.actors.Reactor.  I expect a certain amount of skew in the compilation products is unavoidable, but this looks avoidable.
{code}
<    public final SI-97 of SI-99; //class scala/actors/Reactor$$$$anon$$2 of class scala/actors/Reactor
<    public final SI-101 of SI-99; //class scala/actors/Reactor$$$$anon$$1 of class scala/actors/Reactor
---
>    public final SI-97 of SI-99; //class scala/actors/Reactor$$$$anon$$1 of class scala/actors/Reactor
>    public final SI-101 of SI-99; //class scala/actors/Reactor$$$$anon$$2 of class scala/actors/Reactor

I just tested against master (0c16bb0af13c1b30224dcb9de0b88354663d834b) and the bug with {{$class}} resurrected itself. Such are joys of committing [fixes|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/0444c81889] without proper tests.

I'm trying to see if this can be minimized a bit.
