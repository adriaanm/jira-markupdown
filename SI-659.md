The proposal for scala.Either (SI-251) has functions mapN and mapLeftN where N is 2,3,4 or 5. I have recently noticed that object scala.List also has functions of these names, however, although they have the same signature (except that they are on the object and not the class (why?)), they have very different semantics to the functions written on scala.Either.

Those on scala.Either are equivalent to "lifting" and effectively call flatMap N-1 times plus one call to map.

I am proposing that these functions be renamed to flatMapN and flatMapLeftN in order to prevent confusion for users.
