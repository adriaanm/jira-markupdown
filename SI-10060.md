scala> Range.Long.inclusive(111, 999, -1).max
res28: Long = 111
{code:scala}

I expect `Range.Long.max` to throw java.util.NoSuchElementException to be consistent with `Range.Long.min` and `Range.max` instead of returning a wrong value.

I agree this is a bug, and it seems the minimal fix could be taking this patch for #7432:
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/357c2df4766a35089d91f92067b0cb87924f0ec9

and porting it to NumericRange:
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.0/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/NumericRange.scala#L116-L126

Looking at https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.0/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/Range.scala#L78-L82, it seems the intention is that range creation should create an empty range.

But looking at https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.0/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/NumericRange.scala#L49-L53 (which seems relevant for Range.Long stuff), and at NumericRange.count, it's not obvious that's actually the case.

Since you wrote on Gitter you'd like to work on this: it'd be great, if you can, to also add some testcases at least for this behavior (possibly applying to both sort of ranges?). But a patch would already help.
