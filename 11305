How about:

{code}
trait A{ trait Foo; type FooA = Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
{code}

Generally I would recommend against defining an inner classes with the same name as one in a parent. Use type aliases instead, in the style of scala-reflect. Following that discipline avoids unsoundness traps like SI-6161.
