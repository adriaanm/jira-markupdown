How about:
```scala
trait A{ trait Foo; type FooA = Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
```

Generally I would recommend against defining an inner classes with the same name as one in a parent. Use type aliases instead, in the style of scala-reflect. Following that discipline avoids unsoundness traps like scala/bug#6161.
