```scala
trait AbsA {
  type A
}

trait SomeImplA extends AbsA { self: SomeImplA{type A = ImplA} =>
  // self type reveals self.A = ImplA inside SomeImplA, while leaving A abstract outside
  // the "equivalent" of sealing is to leave the abstract type abstract
  // it does not actively hide anything
  class ImplA
}

// the Deploy* traits are artifacts of encoding sealing
// -- you should only use them when assembling the application from its components (i.e., during deployment)
// components should never refer to the deployment traits directly
trait DeployImplA extends SomeImplA { self: DeployImplA{type A = ImplA} =>
  type A = ImplA
}
```

```scala
/Users/adriaan/Desktop/bugs/encoding_sealing_mixml.scala:15: error: illegal inheritance;
 self-type DeployImplASI-8591{type ASI-10104 = this.ImplASI-8600} does not conform to SomeImplASI-8590's selftype SomeImplASI-8590{type ASI-8603 = this.ImplASI-8600}
trait DeployImplA extends SomeImplA { self: DeployImplA{type A = ImplA} =>
                          ^
one error found
```

expected the following to hold -- could there be an `asSeenFrom` missing that should align the different ThisTypes?
```scala
DeployImplA{type A= this.ImplA}  <: SomeImplA{type A= this.ImplA}
```
Note that omitting `DeployImplA`'s selftype does not solve the problem:


```scala
/Users/adriaan/Desktop/bugs/encoding_sealing_mixml.scala:15: error: illegal inheritance;
 self-type DeployImplA does not conform to SomeImplA's selftype SomeImplA{type A= this.ImplA}
trait DeployImplA extends SomeImplA {
                          ^
one error found
```
several weird things seem to be happening: the implicit `this` in `self: SomeImplA{type A = this.ImplA}` points to the refinement, not to `SomeImplA`. Even after correcting this to `self`, the program won't type check.

Anyway, I guess this is as spec'ed after all, since it's the class's *self type* that must conform to the inherited self types, not the class's type.
