As part of https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2575 , akka-actors was built using the new backend , which revealed that existential types were reaching the bytecode emitter. 
```
[error] ExistentialType reached GenBCode: akka.dispatch.RequiresMessageQueue[_]
```

The relevant code section in GenASM is:
```
// !!! Iulian says types which make no sense after erasure should not reach here,
// which includes the ExistentialType, AnnotatedType, RefinedType.  I don't know
// if the first two cases exist because they do or as a defensive measure, but
// at the time I added it, RefinedTypes were indeed reaching here.
case ExistentialType(_, t)           => toTypeKind(t)
case AnnotatedType(_, t, _)          => toTypeKind(t)
case RefinedType(parents, _)         => parents map toTypeKind reduceLeft lub
```
