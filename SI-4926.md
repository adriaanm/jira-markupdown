Compilation of the following scala code generates different errors for line 9 and 10:

```scala
import collection.parallel.mutable.ParHashMap

class Person(id: String, name: String)

object Sample {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        val person = Some(new Person("id", "name"))
        val users =  new ParHashMap[String, Person]()
        users += (person.get.id, person.get)
        users += person.get.id -> person.get
    }
}
```
For line 9: {code}users += (person.get.id, person.get){code}:
```
Sample.scala:9: error: too many arguments for method +=: (kv: (String, Person))users.type
        users += (person.get.id, person.get)
              ^
```

For line 10: {code}users += person.get.id -> person.get{code}:
```
Sample.scala:10: error: value id is not a member of Person
        users += person.get.id -> person.get
                            ^
```

As for me the second is correct error description, but first is wrong
There is nothing wrong with this error message, it is indeed the correct error message that you should receive. It was correctly closed and labeled "Not a Bug" by Paul. So, it probably should've remained closed.

I think there are multiple points of confusion here, so let me try to elaborate.

In the first case you present, (without the `val`) the error message is to be expected, because, in fact, two things are wrong when it appears you thought that there was only one error. In addition to `id` not being a member of `Person`, \+= is a method which takes only one parameter-- a tuple. While it might appear that you've indeed used a tuple, this is in fact interpreted as an invocation of \+= with multiple parameters, and of course there is only one variant of \+=, and it has a single parameter. So you get an error.

In the second case, you've removed the one error (you've made `id` a field of `Person`), which enables the compiler to attempt to resolve the other error for you. That is, upon finding that you've passed multiple arguments to \+=, the compiler first attempts to typecheck both arguments (which is now successful since `id` is a field), and at the very last step, it attempts to "auto-tuple" your multiple arguments into a single tuple argument. In this case, the transformation is successful and your code compiles. This auto-tupling is indeed expected behavior.

I think the issue here also relates to the documentation for `ParHashMap` (and other `HashMap` variants), which in the 2.9.2 API docs says only:
```scala
def +=(kv: (K, V)): ParHashMap.this.type
```

Applying your example to the API comments, you could write:

```scala
val pair = (person.get.id, person.get)
users += pair // you don't need parentheses in this case because it's clear that there's a single parameter here
```

Which is the same as:
```scala
users += ((person.get.id, person.get)) 
```

In the case where `id` wasn't a `val`, you'd get the error you expected. In the other case, this would compile without issue.

The way it relates to the docs is that if there was a usage example, you probably would not have had to encounter any auto-tupling.

I can clarify the API documentation to add usage examples to illustrate the following two recommended ways to use the `+=` on `HashMaps`:
```scala
users += ((person.get.id, person.get))
users += (person.get.id -> person.get)
```

Here, the second example is a shorthand for tuples, e.g. `val pair = person.get.id -> person.get` is the same as writing `val pair = (person.get.id, person.get)`.

Hope this helps to clear up any confusion.

Anyway, since this isn't a bug, I'm closing this ticket.
