In theory, mutable.MapLike.+ fulfills the contract of collection.MapLike.+ via the mutable.MapBaseLike hack. In practice, it means that + has a different meaning depending on the static type of the map.

I understand that this was needed in order to retain backwards compatibility, but with the usage of @migration in tickets SI-3089 and SI-3145, it seems to me that the same solution could be applied here and MapBaseLike could be removed.
