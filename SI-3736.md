On runime it fails with NoSuchMethodError, what is wrong.
I am happy to say that I thought of this case when implementing ##...
{code}
  // Intercept super.## and translate it to this.##
  // which is fine since it's final.
  case Select(sup @ Super(_, _), nme.HASHHASH)  =>
    Select(gen.mkAttributedThis(sup.symbol), Object_##) setType IntClass.tpe
{code}
...and sorry to say it didn't occur to me that previously existing code might need the same handling.  Makes the fix easy enough.
(In r22702) Disallowed super.XX calls to Any methods which are presently either
crashing the compiler (isInstanceOf) or leading to runtime failure
(== and !=) in addition to one which was being rewritten to a this call
but makes more sense disallowed like the others (##).

Closes SI-3736, review by odersky.
