Syntax highlighting in the context of multiline string literals is broken. It appears to take only the current line into account for determining whether a character is part of a string literal or not.

For example, in the following piece of code, 'arno' is formatted as not part of the string, whereas '+ 7*9' is formatted as being part of a string literal.

println (""" hello 
    		arno""" + 7*9)
(In r19771) Fixed SI-2468. Added indenter tests. Many thanks to Colin Howe for the patch.
