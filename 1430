Because syntax highlighting and code completion in the plugin depend on scalac, if the latter fails (in this case with a StackOverflowError) then so will the former. When this happens it would be extremely helpful if you could try and isolate a minimal test case which reproduces the problem with the command line tools and open a ticket with the component set to "compiler".

It's also possible that you haven't given scalac or Eclipse enough stack for you specific codebase: have you tried increasing it from the default, and if so, to what?
