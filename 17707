The API docs say that isPackage should imply isTerm, which makes sense. However, in 2.10-RC2, isPackage returns true for both packages and package classes, which are not terms.

Example repro code:
```
import scala.tools.nsc
val compiler = new nsc.Global(new nsc.Settings)
new compiler.Run
val sp = compiler.definitions.ScalaPackageClass

println("isPackageClass: " + sp.isPackageClass)
println("isPackage: " + sp.isPackage)
println("isTerm: " + sp.isTerm)
```

This prints:
```
isPackageClass: true
isPackage: true
isTerm: false
```

Something should give. In my opinion, the public API docs make more sense than the current behavior, so change the implementation. Have isPackage return false for package classes.
