The request was filed as an "enhancement" instead of a "bug" because the specification, while accurately followed, is awkward.  It seems that the correct status would be "wontfix" in that case.

Also, the "invalid" resolution does not address the complaint that the generic applied to a singleton returned a type that I cannot refer to.  It inferred _something_, just not anything that I could specify (see REPL output res0 and compare to res1).

(I do not intend to start a debate, just clarify the original posting; if this matter requires further discussion, I'll pick it up on scala-debate or some other appropriate venue.)
