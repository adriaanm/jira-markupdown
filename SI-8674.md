I came across a subtle bug, which occurs when a TreeMap is created with a custom ordening. When the ordening for two keys ends up being the same, the items appear to be "merged", and indexing the Map uses the ordening instead of the actual key.

    val x = TreeMap(("foo", 1), ("bar", 2))(Ordering.by(_.size))
    x("bar") // 2
    x("foo") // 2
    x("nan") // 2

From a Map (with any implementation), I would expect the following:

    x("bar") // 2
    x("foo") // 1
    x("nan") // RuntimeException

It seems strange to me that adding an ordening can affect the number of items in the Map. If this is the intended behavior, what is the benefit of using TreeMap over HashMap with "bar".size as key?
I think there is a misunderstanding as to what an `Ordering` signifies in the context of a `TreeMap`: its main purpose is not to arrange the keys in a particular order (use `x.keys.toSeq.sorted(Ordering.by(\_.size))` for that if your order is in fact only a preorder), but it is used to relate objects according to a total order for the purpose of internal organization. In particular, this comprises treating objects `x` and `y` as **equal** if `Ordering.equiv(x, y)` is `true`. Since by passing Ordering.by(_.size) you establish equality between all strings of the same length in the context of the created map, the output is in fact correct/as expected.

What you would need in this context is a canonical ordering on strings, which could be implemented like this:
```scala
object CanStringOrd extends Ordering[String] {
  def compare(x: String, y: String) =
    if (x.length != y.length) x.length - y.length
    else x.compareTo(y)
}
```
