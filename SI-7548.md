Targeted type-checking in the presentation compiler is sometimes too precise. `askTypeAt(pos)` stops type-checking as soon as the smallest enclosing tree for `pos` has been typed. However, for overloaded method calls this is too early, since the type is not known before looking at the arguments.

This happens for any overloaded method call.

`askTypeAt` should be smarter, and continue type-checking if `tree.tpe.isOverloadedType`.

Observable outcomes of this (in the IDE) are unknown 'hovers', broken hyperlinking that suddenly starts working, unresolved ScalaDoc comments.
Hey Iulian,

That's a great idea to formalize the contract! What you say is the type returned by targeted type-check (if any) is the same as the type obtained by full type-check, right?
That would be great to have. However may it be that `tree.tpe.isOverloadedType` is not only true for method calls?
Seems analyzing tree structure is safer than type-checking enclosing tree unconditionally?
