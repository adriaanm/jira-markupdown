Wow, nice. That sounds about right. It should not be necessary to ensure singletoness on the nested object, since both the nested object and its surrounding object are fresh and unique after deserialization anyway.

Still, I believe that my comment about the {{attr$module}} being volatile stands - that would make nested singleton objects more consistent with the top-level singletons.
