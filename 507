Fixed by reverting change in r14428. But issue scala/bug#602 is broken again.

I wonder if fixing the array copy mechanism wouldn't be better. The fact that it has to unbox each null value in the array to Integer(0) before overwriting it with the copied value just seems wrong.

I reassign this bug to devteam so that the Array expert, whoever that is, can have a look.

If you choose to correct `copy`, please reapply fix for scala/bug#602 that is commented out in scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime in the Java  and CLDC libraries.
