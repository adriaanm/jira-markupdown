Interestingly if I filter out (_.isDeferred), there is still one which gets through, which must be another bug somewhere.
```scala
scala> (typeOf[scala.reflect.api.Universe].members filterNot (_.isVal) filterNot (_.isDeferred) map (_.defString) filter (_ startsWith "val ")).toList.sorted >
val treeCopy: Trees.this.TreeCopier
```
