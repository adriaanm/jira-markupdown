We can write:
{code}
object Obj extends Clss[T forSome { type T }]
{code}
but we cannot write:
{code}
object Obj extends (Clss[T] forSome { type T })
{code}
Why? Is it correct that the first works while the second doesn't? The error is:
{code}
<console>:5: error: illegal inheritance;
 self-type Obj.type does not conform to Clss[T] forSome { type T }'s selftype Clss[T]
{code}
which I frankly admit I don't understand. If, following my only hunch, I try this:
{code}
object Obj extends Clss[T forSome { type T }] with (Clss[T] forSome { type T })
{code}
then the compiler crashes.
I think that's probably an ok solution, and in fact it's the solution I sort of expected to see. But I'm a little concerned about prematurely ruling out something that might actually be useful. I don't really understand yet whether there are reasonable uses for this kind of inheritance. If there are, or even if we don't yet know for sure, I'd sort of prefer that the language allow it.

As far as mixing in non-traits, I would agree that it should be illegal, except that currently in the presence of existentials, it sometimes seems to be meaningful (see bug SI-519). But I assume SI-519 is indeed a bug...

Finally, if this is the solution, the restriction should be documented in SLS.
You now get:
{code}
  <console>:5: error: class type required but Clss[T] forSome { type T } found
       object Obj extends (Clss[T] forSome { type T })
                                   ^
{code}
which is a bit more explicit.
The second example still crashes the compiler:
{code}
object Obj extends Clss[Int] with (Clss[T] forSome {type T})
{code}

In addition, I remain a little concerned about this fix. Why should Clss[T forSome {type T}] be legal while (Clss[T] forSome {type T}) is not? It seems that the only difference is the scope of T. I would prefer to understand the meaning of the construct, if any, before we decide whether to forbid it.

Anyway, sorry to reopen, but I think at least the compiler crash should be recorded.
The second example is now also fixed (in r14136).

> Why should Clss[T forSome {type T}] be legal while (Clss[T] forSome {type T}) is not? 

Because the first is a class type and the second is an existential type.
The spec restricts parent types to be class types. I don't have the time to work out all the ramifications of allowing existentials in parent types. I suspect there will be quite a few subtle ones. That's why I keep to the spec and disallow it. If someone (you?) wants to start research on FS with existentials (and universals?) in parents, that would be very interesting. But that would be for the long term.
