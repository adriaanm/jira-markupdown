Using the collection API I discovered one way to filter out a subtype of a collection (I'll use List in my example):
```scala
scala> class Foo
defined class Foo

scala> class Bar extends Foo
defined class Bar

scala> val list = List(new Foo, new Bar)
list: List[Foo] = List(Foo@71f84d01, Bar@6487b71b)

scala> list collect { case x: Bar => x }
res0: List[Bar] = List(Bar@6487b71b)
```

... so I have extracted all the Bars from a List[Foo] and now have a List[Bar].


It would be even nicer and shorter to write something like this:
```scala
scala> list narrow Bar
res0: List[Bar] = List(Bar@6487b71b)
```

For this to work, one would need a method signature like in the following example:
```scala
scala> class RichList[A](l: List[A]) {
     |   def narrow [B] (c: Class[B]): List[B] =
     |     l collect { case x: B => x }
     | }
<console>:10: warning: abstract type B in type pattern B is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
           l collect { case x: B => x }
                               ^
defined class RichList
```

... but, as you can see, this won't work due to type erasure. I'm also not sure whether to use 'c: Class[B]' for the parameter is the right choice.

The question remains, whether there is a type-safe way to implement this filter method to have the advantage of using the short syntax I presented above to filter a List by a single type.
