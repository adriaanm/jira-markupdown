If you are saying the error message should be tailored to the original syntax, then I would say absolutely it should. But it sounds like you're saying not to warn at all, and the logic of that escapes me.

No, no, no, I didn't make it clear enough, sorry: the warning is useless only for the syntax in question, no doubt about its usefulness in the general sense.
