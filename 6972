I did not see this warning with 2.9.1-final.

The only reason this code exists is due to issue https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5281
Where it seems that if class[@specialized T] A { def f[@specialized W](a:T):W}

is not specializing across the cross product of T and W.  This was a workaround to force
specialization across the input and output.
