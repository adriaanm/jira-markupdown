Issue: have 3 or more dependent classes spread across projects: Project1 ( Class1 <- Class2) <- Project2 (Class3).

If Class1 is broken, then Class2 is correctly not compiled. However, Project 2 is compiled and Class3 fails with "not found: type Class2".

In multiple projects, this cascades and causes an unholly mess of hundreds of errors, every time a "base" class is saved with an error - actually hiding the original error.

Solution seems simple enough: if pre-requisite projects have compilation errors, do not compile dependent projects - especially during incremental builds. Maybe should still try them when clean/build...
