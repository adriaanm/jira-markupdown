If you try this:
var source = scala.io.Source.fromURL("http://www.itsascam.co.nz","UTF-8")
source.foreach(line => ())

you get this:
java.nio.BufferUnderflowException
        at java.nio.Buffer.nextGetIndex(Buffer.java:474)
        at java.nio.HeapCharBuffer.get(HeapCharBuffer.java:117)

The problem doesn't seem to occur if UTF-8 is not specified, but then of course one gets all quote characters replaced by funny characters.
That's because the encoding is not UTF-8.
```scala
var source = scala.io.Source.fromURL("http://www.itsascam.co.nz","ISO-8859-1") source.foreach(line => ())
```

works just fine. You can check the encoding in your browser.
I still think this is a bug.

If the API crashes unless the correct encoding is given then how can one use this API to read a file, while preserving unicode characters, if one doesn't know what encoding the file uses? If one doesn't specify an encoding then unicode characters are lost for pages that use them.

Also, even if it is correct to fail to read a URL unless the caller specifies the correct encoding then failing with an underflow exception seems to be the wrong behaviour.

I'm currently using the standard Java IO APIs from Scala and that works fine. 

OK! Here's a little transcript with today's trunk.
```scala
scala> val source = scala.io.Source.fromURL(new java.net.URL("http://www.itsascam.co.nz"))(io.Codec("ISO-8859-1"))             
source: scala.io.Source = non-empty iterator

scala> io.File("/tmp/1883-iso8859-1.html").writeAll(List(source.toList.mkString))(java.nio.charset.Charset.forName("ISO-8859-1"))
```
Now /tmp/1883-iso8859-1.html is identical to the file obtained by "wget http://www.itsascam.co.nz".

You can read it as if were UTF-8 too, even though it isn't:
```scala
val source = scala.io.Source.fromURL(new java.net.URL("http://www.itsascam.co.nz"))(io.Codec("UTF-8"))                                                          source: scala.io.Source = non-empty iterator

scala> io.File("/tmp/1883-utf8.html").writeAll(List(source.toList.mkString))(java.nio.charset.Charset.forName("ISO-8859-1"))                                                            
```
And the erroneous characters by default are ignored.  Notice it's 9 bytes shorter, because they were dropped.
```scala
[paulp@jon tmp]$$ ls -l *.html
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  wheel  18100 Aug 16 15:59 1883-iso8859-1.html
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  wheel  18091 Aug 16 16:01 1883-utf8.html
```
Precise interface remains in flux.
