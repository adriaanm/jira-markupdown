Re deprecation, as I indicated up top you can overload them.  The question is whether the implicits will be ambiguous.  I think the ambiguity can be evaded.

As to it trying to find a manifest for A, it looks like something is breaking down during its confusion, and it winds up inferring A as the type argument to toArray.  It makes no sense, and if you write super.toArray[B] the error is more to the point.
