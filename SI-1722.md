Spinoff of #1107, whose resolution will depend on this being resolved.  Both sealed and private must be present.
```scala
sealed trait Top
trait C {
  private object P extends Top
}                                                                                                                     
  
$$ scala -e 'new AnyRef with C'
error: error while loading Top, class file '/private/tmp/bobobo/./Top.class' is broken
(error reading Scala signature of /private/tmp/bobobo/./Top.class: malformed Scala signature of Top at 185; reference value P of trait C refers to nonexisting symbol.)
one error found

```
I am becoming frustrated with this bug, but someone else who picks it up should note this:
```scala
% scalac -Ylog:jvm T.scala
// if P is not private
[log jvm] Generating method C.P
// but if P is private
[log jvm] Generating method C.C$$$$P
```
It all seems to tie into EXPANDEDNAME (I'm not shouting, it's a flag.)
