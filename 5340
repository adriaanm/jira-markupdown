first step in fixing this: https://github.com/adriaanm/scala/tree/2d61c08

I think adapt should turn repeated paramtypes into the corresponding type after uncurry since the spec says 'The type of such a repeated parameter inside the method is then the sequence type scala.Seq[T]'. 

I don't know what to derive from this concerning the type of the argument of the method and its eta-expansion since these are *outside* of the method, and the spec fragment talks about *inside* the method.
