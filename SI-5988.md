For code that must deal with precise values using BigDecimal, having to use string literals (i.e. BigDecimal("3.14159")) or the value/scale factories to create new values can be unwieldy. Using doubles can cause floating-point representation issues.

Other languages have defined the m/M suffix for decimal literals directly (e.g. 3.14159m).
With macros + string interpolation, you could build something like: 

```scala
d"3.14159"
```

I demonstrated something similar for binary literals: https://github.com/retronym/macrocosm/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/github/retronym/macrocosm/Macrocosm.scala#L52
Closing: Other proposals for new literals haven't gained traction, the string interpolation approach+macro works well, e.g https://github.com/non/spire provides `dec"3.1415"`.
