I find that resolution somewhat surprising, because this has little to do with AnyRef specialization or the specialization of Function1.  It is true that specializing Function1 on AnyRef makes it easier to encounter this pre-existing bug, because Function1 is everywhere.  I'm not contesting it, but I hope the bathwater bucket doesn't turn out to have nothing but baby in it.
