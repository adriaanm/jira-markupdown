Java arrays are cloneable. I've expected Scala arrays to be cloneable too, but:

scala> val a = new Array[Int](4)
a: Array[Int] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0)

scala> val b = a.clone
<console>:5: error: method clone cannot be accessed in Array[Int]
       val b = a.clone
                 ^

boxed arrays are not cloneable, too:

scala> def c[T] (a: Array[T]) = a.clone
<console>:5: error: method clone cannot be accessed in Array[T]
       def c[T] (a: Array[T]) = a.clone

is it possible to make arrays cloneable? I know I can make a new array and call copyToArray but cloning is faster and simpler.

I also would love to have some means for quick array resizing, i.e. creating a new array of new size and copying `(new.length min old.length)` elements. In some future, when Scala will drop Java 1.5 compatibility it could even be done with `java.util.Arrays.copyOf`
