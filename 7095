Looks like the underlying problem isn't solved, it's just masked by SI-5923. As soon as the latter was fixed (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2464), the troubles manifested themselves again.

{code}
scala> lub(List(typeOf[Array[String]], typeOf[Array[Nothing]]))
res2: reflect.runtime.universe.Type = Array[_ <: String]
{code}

I wonder how to reconcile this behavior of `lub` with the fact that arrays of Nothing are represented as arrays of Objects at runtime.
