The below REPL examples shows the observed behavior under Scala 2.9.0.1 and 2.9.1.RC1. Under 2.9.0.1 there seem to be two bugs, one regarding type inference and the other regarding abstracting over sequential and parallel Seqs (that might also apply to other collections). Under 2.9.1.RC1 only the later occurs, yet the type inferencer seems to use a structural type instead of GenSeq.

The real issue from a user's perspective is, that even if a parallel Seq is returned by the numbers-method, map won't be executed in parallel, i.e. abstracting over sequential and parallel collections is broken.

The type it is inferring is GenSeq[Int] { refinement }.  This is by definition also a GenSeq[Int].  You're seeing the the same thread in all 8 because 8 is such a low number it doesn't bother spreading the load.

First (the more important comes below), it doesn't work for 1000 elements, neither:

scala> def numbers(isPar: Boolean) = if (isPar) (1 to 1000).par else 1 to 1000
numbers: (isPar: Boolean)scala.collection.GenSeq[Int] with Serializable{def companion: scala.collection.generic.GenericCompanion[scala.collection.GenSeq{def seq: scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Any]}]; def par: scala.collection.parallel.immutable.ParSeq[Int]; def seq: scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Int]; def distinct: scala.collection.GenSeq[Int]{def seq: scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Int]; def distinct: scala.collection.GenSeq[Int]{def seq: scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Int]; protected def parCombiner: scala.collection.parallel.Combiner[Int,scala.collection.parallel.immutable.ParSeq[Int]]}; def intersect[U >: Int](that: scala.collection.GenSeq[U]): scala.collection.GenSeq[Int]{def seq: scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Int]; protected def parCombiner: scala.collection.parallel.Combiner[I...
scala> numbers(true) map { _ => Thread.currentThread.getName }
res8: scala.collection.GenSeq[java.lang.String] = ParVector(Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, Thread-17, ...

Second: How can the collections know whether the load is high or not? Even for a small number like 8 or even 3 it could make sense to perform operations in parallel. Example using a collection of functions making web service requests:

object Weather {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val locations = Seq(
        ...
        "Berlin-Germany",
        "San Francisco-USA")
    val isParallel = args.headOption map {_ == "par"} getOrElse false
    val time0 = System.currentTimeMillis
    val currentTemperatures =
      if (isParallel) (locations.par map currentTemperature).flatten.seq
      else (locations map currentTemperature).flatten
    val time1 = System.currentTimeMillis
    val averageTemperature = currentTemperatures.sum / currentTemperatures.size
    println("Calculated average temperature of about %s Â°C in %s ms.".format(averageTemperature, time1 - time0))
  }

  def currentTemperature(location: String): Option[Int] = {
    def extractTemperature(weatherResponse: Elem) =
      (weatherResponse \\ "current_conditions" \ "temp_c").headOption flatMap { temp =>
        catching(classOf[NumberFormatException]) opt { (temp \ "@data").text.toInt }
      }
    val weatherRequest = :/("www.google.com") / "ig" / "api" <<? Map("weather" -> location, "hl" -> "en")
    Http(weatherRequest <> extractTemperature)
  }
}
a) It does work, for significantly fewer than 1000 elements, as I already demonstrated.

b) "How can it know whether the load is high or not" is a question about the design, not a bug.  Please give me a chance to have something else in my life besides this bug database by reserving the bug database for bugs.
This isn't fixed in 2.9.1.RC1. So it is still a bug.

```

Aleksandar fixed that in r25235 but it was apparently not yet chosen for 2.9.1 probably also because I didn't report the bug earlier.
Oh, it's 2.9.1 we're worried about.  You derailed me with the structural type talk.  Have to see about anything else for 2.9.1.
Here's a workaround for a few of those cases where you have control over the call-sites:

Put a definition like at a place where it can be seen from the call-sites of `map` etc.

```scala
implicit def possiblyParallelCanBuildFrom[Elem]: CanBuildFrom[GenSeq.Coll, Elem, GenSeq[Elem]] =
  if (isPar)
    ParSeq.canBuildFrom[Elem].asInstanceOf[CanBuildFrom[GenSeq.Coll, Elem, GenSeq[Elem]]]
  else
    GenSeq.canBuildFrom[Elem]
```

You can, of course, only use it if you manage to pass isPar around, as well. Overall not very usable in the end but it did work for us in one place because we configured isPar globally anyways.
