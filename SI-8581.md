It seems some features were not correctly transferred between Scala versions 2.10.x and 2.11.0. In particular Auto-complete feature does not recognise functions or objects that were imported. 

Example in 2.11.0:
{{scala> import Math.cos}}
{{import Math.cos}}
{{scala> co<tab>}}
{{com   collection   compat   concurrent}}

While in 2.10.4 it was:
{{scala>import Math.cos}}
{{import Math.cos}}   
{{scala> co<tab>}}
{{cos          com          collection   compat       concurrent}}

This feature is highly desired as it allows to quickly access method that were automatically imported. It also does not work for objects - this is very useful as it used to be possible to do this in 2.10.x: 
{{CustomObject.<tab>}}
{{gives methods}}
This also does not work anymore. Hopefully these great features can be revived. Thank you!
Thanks for verifying that some features used to work.
