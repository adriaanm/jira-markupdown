Casting a numeric value type to another will result in a conversion:

{code}
5L.asInstanceOf[Int]        // --> 5: Int
(5L: Any).asInstanceOf[Int] // throws ClassCastException
{code}

Boxing should be transparent, so they should result in the same behavior.

It is discussable which behavior is desirable:
* From a typing point of view, a {{Long}} is not an {{Int}} and the cast should therefore fail. Also, a cast could/should be considered as a pure type operation and not a conversion/coercion.
* The scala spec supports the behavior of the unboxed version in ยง12.1
