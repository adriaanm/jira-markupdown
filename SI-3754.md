The methods **eq**, **equals** and **==** are still confusing to users, though better than the situation in Java.

This is partly because **eq** is very poorly named:

- it does not describe its function: in fact, it seems to be an abbrevation for the **equals** method!

- it is not a word, unlike *every* other non-symbolic method name in Scala.

Solution: fortunately there is a word in English which describes identity, namely **is**. So deprecate **eq** and introduce **is** instead.

Similarly deprecate **ne**, which is an even worse name (it seems to be an assembler mnemonic!), in favour of **isnt**.

This isn't a drastic change because **eq** should be fairly rare in user code (outside the libraries). Confusion solved!
