This would only be possible with a macro for s-interpolator. Probably there's no reason not to do that, and folks have asked for it. It would enable this issue and also trivial optimizations like {{s"hello, ${"world"}"}}.

Just wanted to say, once more, how I don't like spending time formatting JIRA comments.

I meant s"hello, ${"world"}" where the whole. string is a literal. Wow, it also borked that. No, I refuse to click the question mark link to research the formatting language. I have a life, too.
