The following code causes ParallelMatching to blow up:
```scala
object Test extends Application {
val o = new { self =>
              override def equals(other : Any) : Boolean =
                 other match {
                   case that : self.type => true
                   case _ => false
                 }
      }
}
```
There are fairly good reasons for wanting to write it.  Writing 
```scala
object Test extends Application {
val o = new { self =>
              override def equals(other : Any) : Boolean =
                 other match {
                   case that : self.type => true
                   ...
                   case _ => false
                 }
      }
}
```
is more uniform than writing
```scala
object Test extends Application {
val o = new { self =>
              override def equals(other : Any) : Boolean =
                 (self eq other) ||
                 (other match {
                   ...
                   case _ => false
                  })
      }
}
```
well said, sir. the mood of the moment deluded me into thinking 
{
  case `self` => true
  ...
  case _ => false
}

would *not* lead to infinite recursion. But, regarding alternatives to the use-case at hand, writing ...
{
  case x if (x eq self) => true
  ...
  case _ => false
}
seems ok, too.

Never mind, I'll look into it. 
The problem is not the singleton type, the problem seems to be more the anonymous class. From the stacktrace (-Ydebug)

```

What sense can I make out of this AST, if its type is "template anon", I am not going to be able to create an instanceof check out of it.

I think the semantics of self.type for an anonymous class are not covered by the spec (when it was written, such modern stuff didn't yet exist in any case :-).

It raises interesting possibilities of anonymous-class-self-type-tests to be used for dynamic structural subtype-checking, but the margin of this bug report comment is too small to fit in the proof that it all works out.
Turns out this is excluding code which used to work.
```scala
class A {
  def f(x: Any): Unit = x match {
    case _: this.type => println("this")
    case _ => println("other")
  }                                                                             
}                                                                               

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = new A
    x.f(5)
    x.f(new A)
    x.f(x)
  }                                                                             
}  
```

This prints "other other this" in 2.7.  I will fix it.
(In r23380) Some uninteresting code related to error messages, which I'm
checking in mostly because I booted the r23379 commit in a git-svn
meltdown and posterity demands the message, which was:

You can now use the self-type of an anonymous class as a singleton
type in a pattern match ON THE MOON.  Actual test case excerpt:

  val x4 = new { self =>
    def f(x: Any) = x match {
      case _: x1.type     => 1
      case _: x2.type     => 2
      case _: x3.type     => 3
      case _: self.type   => 4
      case x: Dingus.type => x.IamDingus
    }
  }

Closes #576, no review.
