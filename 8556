We always judge language extensions by their impact on the complexity of the spec.

Can we make a list of all the ways in which we had to restrict value classes because of current implementation restrictions?

I agree it's not a decision we should take lightly, but I feel the burden is on the extension to prove it's worth it.

Also, implicit classes that **directly** extend AnyVal should be supported, but maybe anything beyond directly extending AnyVal should be considered experimental for now.
I'll start a thread on scala-internals to discuss this in detail.
