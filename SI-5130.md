{code}
scala> class A {
     |   this_a =>
     |   def b= new B
     |   class B {
     |     def a: this_a.type= this_a
     |   }
     | }
defined class A

scala> def a= new A {
     |   def c { }
     | }
a: A{def c: Unit}

scala> a.b.a.c
<console>:10: error: value c is not a member of A
       a.b.a.c
             ^
{code}

Checking the type of a.b.a shows why:

{code}
scala> a.b.a
res1: A = $anon$1@fe210a
{code}

Should be A{def c: Unit}

Surprisingly, changing the "def a" into a "val" works around the issue in this particular case:
{code}
scala> val a= new A {
     |   def c { }
     | }
a: A{def c: Unit} = $anon$1@2f0bd7

scala> a.b.a
res3: a.type = $anon$1@2f0bd7

scala> a.b.a.c
{code}

Note that using A.this.type instead of this_a.type doesn't help -- same behaviour.

A general workaround requires passing this_a.type as a type parameter:

{code}
scala> class A {
     |   this_a =>
     |   def b= new B[this_a.type]
     |   class B[E >: this_a.type] {
     |     def a: E= this_a
     |   }
     | }
defined class A

scala> def a= new A {
     |   def c { }
     | }
a: A{def c: Unit}

scala> a.b.a.c

scala> 
{code}

This also affects mix-ins:

{code}
scala>   abstract class A {
     |     this_a =>
     |     class B {
     |       def a: this_a.type= this_a
     |     }
     |     def b= new B
     |   }
defined class A

scala>   trait A2 {
     |     def c { }
     |   }
defined trait A2

scala>   def a= new A with A2
a: A with A2

scala>   a.b.a.c
<console>:11: error: value c is not a member of A
         a.b.a.c
               ^
{code}

I've traced the problem to this fragment in method typeRef in scala.reflect.internal.Types:

{code}     
      val pre1 = pre match {
       case x: SuperType if sym1.isEffectivelyFinal || sym1.isDeferred =>
         x.thistpe
       case _: CompoundType if sym1.isClass =>
         // sharpen prefix so that it is maximal and still contains the class.
         pre.parents.reverse dropWhile (_.member(sym1.name) != sym1) match {
           case Nil         => pre
           case parent :: _ => parent
         }
       case _ => pre
     }
{code}

I don't see why we want to loose type information of `CompoundType`s in this manner. Maybe it is useful to make inferred types wider? I can't see how, except in the presence of a this.type -- which is exactly where it can break things... but of course my sight here is really limited.

That's some good detective work.  I can add the observation that removing the second case in its entirety has zero observable impact anywhere in the distribution or test suite, except that a.b.a.c starts working.  Assigning to martin for an opinion on what it is trying to accomplish.  Any code which can be removed without observable impact must be presumed buggy: either it isn't doing what is intended, or the bug is the absence of a test case which backstops its purpose by breaking in its absence.


I don't know what the proposed fix held, but here is what I meant - at the time I wrote the above, this change had no observable impact except to fix this ticket.
