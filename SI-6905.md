The throwException method doesn't exist on sun.misc.Unsafe on Android,
but good news, it can be emulated in Java without any performance loss.

From jsr116y: http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/ForkJoinTask.java?view=markup
```java
    /**
     * A version of "sneaky throw" to relay exceptions
     */
    static void rethrow(final Throwable ex) {
        if (ex != null) {
            if (ex instanceof Error)
                throw (Error)ex;
            if (ex instanceof RuntimeException)
                throw (RuntimeException)ex;
            ForkJoinTask.<RuntimeException>uncheckedThrow(ex);
        }
    }

    /**
     * The sneaky part of sneaky throw, relying on generics
     * limitations to evade compiler complaints about rethrowing
     * unchecked exceptions
     */
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") static <T extends Throwable>
        void uncheckedThrow(Throwable t) throws T {
        if (t != null)
            throw (T)t; // rely on vacuous cast
    }
```
