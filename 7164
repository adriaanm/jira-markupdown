`nom(<expr>)()` fails to typecheck, because the () is first interpreted as an empty argument list. But in the process of determining this, `<expr>` is wrapped in a `Function0`, and the symbols within have there owner changed. That `Function0` is discarded and things are tried again with a single Unit argument, but by this stage the ownership chain is messed up, and later attempts to patch the owner in `Uncurry` are impeded.
