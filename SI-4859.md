==========================================================================================
This is a bug, affected versions (at least) 2.9.0.1, 2.9.1.RC1 and 2.10 (a recent nightly)
==========================================================================================

Try to compile the following:

object O {
  val o = C().CC(0)
}
case class C(s: String = "") {
  case class CC(ii: Int) {
    val ss = s
  }
}

Will result in
error: java.lang.NullPointerException
	at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Typers$Typer.typedTypeConstructor(Typers.scala:4329)
	at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Typers$Typer.typedTypeConstructor(Typers.scala:4353)
	at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Typers$Typer.typedNew$1(Typers.scala:3185) ...
Minimized.
{code}
object O {
  new C().CC()
}

class C() {
  case class CC()
}
{code}

(extempore in [r25453|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25453]) Don't want to chase NPEs around for the rest of my life. Created
"NoCompilationUnit" and "NoSourceFile" objects to represent not-present
versions of these items. Seems a lot better than null. References
SI-4859, got past NPE only to uncover the actual problem. No review.
NPE fixed, actual problem is shown here (test/pending/pos/bug4859.scala)

{code}
object O {
  // error: C is not a legal prefix for a constructor
  C().CC()
  // but this works.
  D().DD()
}

case class C() {
  case class CC()
}

case class D() {
  class DD()
  object DD {
    def apply() = new DD()
  }
}
{code}

The following is also a manifestation of this bug:

{code}
object Test {
case class B() { case class C() }
var b = B()
var c = b.C()
}
{code}

This bug is now fixed in version scala-2.10.0.r25798-b20111007023456.
That depends on the point of view.  For the compiler developer the "actual issue" might be something different than for the user.  My issue is not that I have to rewrite my code but that I have to spend 2 hours to find out what might be going wrong with the build and which change caused the problem (of course I first think that it's MY fault) and that I have to explain to my team that Scala is a good choice although the compiler crashes without giving a message.  The "actual issue" is not a problem at all because there's an easy workaround. (Replace "C().CC()" with "val c = C(); c.CC()")

My suggestion is to "fix" the problem by giving a helpful message to the user (such as: known bug in the compiler, see issue SI-4859 for suggested workaround"). That shouldn't be much work in the compiler but can save users time and gives a much better impression.  Of course a "real fix" would be better but I'd prefer an earlier release with a message that improves the user experience.
There is no constructor invocation in this code.  The compiler is the only one throwing around constructor invocations.  As far as the author of the code is concerned, it's two method calls. At the point where the compiler should be inserting a constructor call, it does have a stable prefix: "this".
{code}
object O {
  // error: C is not a legal prefix for a constructor
  C().CC()
}
{code}
(From the example in my most recent comment containing code.)
