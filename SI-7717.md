In the following code example, the compiler is completely right by telling me that `SomeClass` could not be found:

```scala
scala> class SomeClass
defined class SomeClass

scala> val xs = Seq(SomeClass)
<console>:16: error: not found: value SomeClass
       val xs = Seq(SomeClass)
                    ^
```

Unfortunately this error message could be improved. The compiler knows that there is a class with the same name, thus it can assume that the user accidentally forgotten the `new` keyword. An improved error message could look like:

```scala
scala> val xs = Seq(SomeClass)
<console>:16: error: not found: value SomeClass. Class SomeClass found instead, did you mean to create an instance of it?
       val xs = Seq(SomeClass)
                    ^
```
It already does this, but I guess it misses repl-defined classes.
```scala
scala> val x = scala.Mutable
<console>:7: error: object Mutable is not a member of package scala
Note: trait Mutable exists, but it has no companion object.
       val x = scala.Mutable
                     ^
```
You're right, "different packages" appears to be the trigger.
```scala
package s1 {
  class SomeClass
}
package s2 {
  object Test { Seq(s1.SomeClass) }
}
// ./a.scala:8: error: object SomeClass is not a member of package s1
// Note: class SomeClass exists, but it has no companion object.
//   object Test { Seq(s1.SomeClass) }
//                        ^
// one error found
```
