I'm not quite sure of the intended behaviour here. I've been trying to serialise an Enumeration (in 2.7 and 2.8), but it doesn't seem to work as I expected.

b: MyEnum.Value = 1

false

After poking around in the (2.7) source a little, it seems that Value is being "resolved", but the actual Enumeration "MyEnum" object isn't (and why values end up non-equal too). I have a work-around - inserting {{def readResolve(): AnyRef = MyEnum}} method in MyEnum fixes it.

Should it be necessary that I provide my own readResolve method on each of my Enumeration objects? It's not really an issue, I just have quite a few in my object model, and I want to serialise the whole thing.

I just thought this was slightly unexpected behaviour, especially if you are used to Enum serialisation in Java. It is also something easily forgotten, and then enum values just end up unequal when you would probably expect they should be.
Doh. The {{reserialise}} should of course be {{serialise}} in the second-to-last line of the REPL session.

Thanks!

I'm reopening (assigning to myself, but anyone else please feel free) for the reasons described in SI-3186.
(In r21235) Fixes SI-3186. Closes SI-2214.
While looking into SI-3616, I noticed that the fix for this bug (in r21235) maintains a strong reference to every user-defined Enumeration.  This is quite bad because as long as there are strong references to Scala library classes, user classes will not be garbage collected.

How do you think we should address this? Would it be enough to use weak references and recreate the enum values if they're collected? It's not entirely clear to me how everything fits together.
Actually: can't I treat this like another Symbol interning cache? Look, I wrote it to be reused:
{code}
/** This is private so it won't appear in the library API, but
  * abstracted to offer some hope of reusability.  */
private[scala] abstract class UniquenessCache[K, V >: Null]
{code}
IS THIS MY BIG CHANCE FOR REUSE?
Weak references for keys and values should work:
{code}
private val emap = new WeakHashMap[Class[_], Reference[Enumeration]]
{code}

I'm not sure why the singleton isn't obtained with reflection, though:
{code}
val enum = getClass.getField("MODULE$$").get(null)
{code}
(In r22463) Took a cue from mharrah that we don't need to build global static
data to keep track of something when we know where it's kept.
Altered the Enumeration deserialization scheme to use reflection, preserving
the singleton property by delivering the MODULE$$ singleton.  This solves
the GC issue and lets us drop synchronization to boot.  Also added
some graceful failure for malformed Enumerations.  All tests look good
but a second opinion is in order: closes SI-2214, review by phaller.
