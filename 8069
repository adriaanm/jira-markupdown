Here's a somewhat terrifying minimization (at least I assume it's the same bug, haven't looked that closely at this one.) Terrifying because commenting out any of the other cases - the one before NoPrefix, or either of the two after - makes the warning go away.  What, it became reachable because of the absence of later cases? Are we moving backward in pattern matcher time? Is this the matcher of adriaan grey?
```scala
trait Foo extends scala.reflect.internal.SymbolTable {
  def g(x: Any) = x match {
    case NoType           =>
    case NoPrefix         =>
    case tpe: Type        => 
    case product: Product => 
  }
}

/*
% m3scalac ./a.scala 
% m4scalac ./a.scala 
./a.scala:7: warning: unreachable code
      case NoPrefix         =>
                            ^
one warning found
*/
```
