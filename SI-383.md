```scala
scala> val s = collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3)
s: scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int] = Set(3, 1, 2)

scala> s map {x => 0}
res5: Iterable[Int] = ArrayBuffer(0, 0, 0)
```

The problem is that `map` is not overriden in `Set`, so the default implementation in `Iterable` is called.

This seems to be fixed in trunk! (Hurray for new collections library!)

```scala
scala> val s = collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3) s: scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int] = Set(3, 1, 2)

scala> s map {x => 0} res2: scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int] = Set(0)
```
