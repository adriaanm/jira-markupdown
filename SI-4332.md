These are particularly bad because they are runtime failures with no obvious way to know what will fail.  Example.
{code}
scala> List(1,2,3).view.dropRight(1)
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: SeqView(...).newBuilder
	at scala.collection.TraversableViewLike$$class.newBuilder(TraversableViewLike.scala:53)
	at scala.collection.SeqLike$$$$anon$$2.newBuilder(SeqLike.scala:978)
	at scala.collection.IterableLike$$class.dropRight(IterableLike.scala:176)
	at scala.collection.SeqLike$$$$anon$$2.dropRight(SeqLike.scala:978)
	at .<init>(<console>:8)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:11)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at $$export(<console>)
{code}
It would make a lot more sense to me if views implemented an abstract interface (and thus the compiler would tell us what methods aren't covered) than having them override all kinds of inherited implementations, with runtime failure for methods which are missed or otherwise elude the concrete barriers.

(Get it, concrete barriers? That is gold.)
For now, scala collection views are not usable at all, see errors below. It is very bad thing, since there are NO WARNINGS about broken feature in API docs. I thought Scala API is more or less stable, disregarding small bugs. I believe it is wrong to leave broken features in Scala releases.

scala> util.Properties.versionString
res9: java.lang.String = version 2.9.1.final

scala> Seq(1,2,3,4).view(1,3).slice(0,1)
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: SeqViewS(...).newBuilder
        at scala.collection.TraversableViewLike$class.newBuilder(TraversableView
Like.scala:69)
        at scala.collection.SeqViewLike$$anon$6.newBuilder(SeqViewLike.scala:80)

        at scala.collection.IterableLike$class.slice(IterableLike.scala:95)
        at scala.collection.SeqViewLike$$anon$6.slice(SeqViewLike.scala:80)
        at scala.collection.SeqViewLike$$anon$6.slice(SeqViewLike.scala:80)
  ... skipped ...

Another kind of gap is operations that don't fail at runtime, but don't give view-like behavior, either. For example, scanLeft on a SeqView is eager in both 2.9.2 and 2.10.0:

{noformat}
scala> List.range(1, 5).view.scanLeft(0){case (a, b) => println(b); a + b}
1
2
3
4
res4: scala.collection.SeqView[Int,Seq[_]] = SeqViewC(...)
{noformat}

The methods that fail with UnsupportedOperationException (as far as I know) are

{noformat}
combinations
distinct
dropRight
inits
permutations
tails
takeRight
{noformat}
Another example from SI-7610

{code}
scala> a.view.map { _+1}.filter{_%2==0}.distinct
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: SeqViewMF(...).newBuilder
at scala.collection.TraversableViewLike$class.newBuilder(TraversableViewLik
{code}
I've hit the problem with the SeqViewLike. all the methods of SeqLike not overriden in the trait are forwarded back to the SeqLike trait, and try to use the standard builder. From what I could see in the code I think this could be case for other collection as well.

I wonder if it would not be safer for the community to deprecate or remove views and favour iterator style in one of the next releases. This is a small non breaking change that will immediately force user to run away from views.
