When I put all members of a package in the same group, the {{@group}} is ignored.

{code:scala}
/** @group foo */
object Bar

/** @group foo */
class Baz
{code}

!same-group.PNG|thumbnail!

I expect that there is one group, "foo", that contains both "Bar" and "Baz". Instead, there are the default groups "Type Members" and "Value Members".

I did some more experiments: When I put the members in different groups, they are shown correctly:

{code:scala}
/** @group foo */
object Bar

/** @group other */
class Baz
{code}

!different-groups.PNG|thumbnail!

When I put only one of them in a group, both are shown correctly:

!ungrouped.PNG|thumbnail!
