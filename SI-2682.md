It would be nice if the new object creation dialog would have the option to add a main method. 

def main(args: Array[String]) {
	
}



For example if you create a Java class you have this option; would be nice to have the same in the Scala plugin.


I've just opened SI-2685 as more general issue to track all the wizard related developments for SDT.
Yes, I think it would make sense to deal with this as part of SI-2685. As with that issue, this might make for an ideal task for someone who wants to make a first contribution to the IDE.
(In r20975) Much improved new Scala class/trait/object wizards. Fixes SI-2685 and SI-2682. Many thanks to Tim Clendenen for the patch.
