Given the following code:
```scala
class A {    
    var current = ">>> "
    def append(str: String) = {
        current = current + str
        this
    }    
}

class B extends A

val a: A = new A() append "hello"
println(a.current)

val b: B = new B() append "hello"
println(b.current)
```

I would expect a correct compilation, as class B does not override append.

Rather than that, I get the following compilation error:
```scala
jponge@eduroinsa143:Temp $$ scala fail_inference.scala 
(fragment of fail_inference.scala):14: error: type mismatch;
 found   : this.A
 required: this.B
val b: B = new B() append "hello"
                    ^
one error found
!!!
discarding <script preamble>
```

If I remove the explicit type on the following declaration:

`val b = new B() append "hello"`

then the code compiles. However, the instance b is really of type B!

This example is a showcase for similar problems we get in our API design.

What versions of the following are you using?
Scala: 2.7.7 or 2.8.0
Java: 6
Operating system: Mac OS X
