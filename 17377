{code}
def foo = {
  var a = ArrayBuffer[Int]()
  println (a.isInstanceOf[Seq[Int]])
}
{code}
gives the following warning under -checked:
{code}
warning: non variable type-argument Int in type scala.collection.mutable.Seq[Int] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
  println (a.isInstanceOf[Seq[Int]])
{code}

Surely there should be no complaint about erasure in a purely local analysis. I'm telling it that it is a buffer of Int, and expect it to infer that it is a seq of Int.
