Ok, nested comments. I actually had the following:

{code}
/**
 ....
 *   &ltpattern&gt/helloworld/*&lt/pattern&gt
 ....
 */
{code}

where the inner start-of-comment was a path element.
It did not occur to me that nested comments were
support (though, thinking back, I now remember reading
about them ... oh well).
