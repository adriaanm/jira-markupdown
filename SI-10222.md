tl;dr: if the compiler implicitly constructs an `Ordering\[T\]` from a `Comparable\[T\]` at some point, then later implicit construction of an `Ordering\[(T, U)\]` from an `Ordered\[T\]` (in unrelated code) will throw a "divergent implicit expansion" error.

This behavior is sensitive to the order in which (otherwise unrelated) files are compiled, and also reliably puts zinc in an inconsistent state where a `clean` changes whether compilation succeeds or fails.

A minimal repro can be found at [ryan-williams/scalac-bug](https://github.com/ryan-williams/scalac-bug), and is reproduced below:

##### B.scala
```scala
trait B extends Comparable[B]
object B {
  /**
   * Iff this line is compiled before [[C]] below, then [[C]] will throw a "divergent implicit 
   * expansion" error, though the compiler should not carry any state from here to there.
   */
  implicitly[Ordering[B]]
}
```

##### C.scala
```scala
case class C(n: Int) extends Ordered[C] {
  override def compare(that: C): Int = n - that.n
}

object C {
  /**
   * Fails to compile when this class is lexicographically greater than [[B]].
   */
  implicitly[Ordering[(C, Boolean)]]
}
```

#### Repro steps

##### Compiling `B.scala` and `C.scala`: **fails**:

```scala
$ scalac src/main/scala/org/abc/{B,C}.scala
src/main/scala/org/abc/C.scala:11: error: diverging implicit expansion for type Ordering[(org.abc.C, Boolean)]
starting with method $conforms in object Predef
  implicitly[Ordering[(C, Boolean)]]
            ^
one error found
```

##### Compiling `C.scala` and `B.scala`: **succeeds**

```scala
$ scalac src/main/scala/org/abc/{C,B}.scala
$ rm -rf org  # clean up generated .class files
```

##### `sbt compile` a working branch causes broken branch to require `sbt clean`

```scala
$ git checkout spoil
$ sbt clean compile    # succeeds, correctly
$ git checkout master
$ sbt compile          # succeeds, (erroneously?)
$ sbt clean compile    # fails, (correctly?)
```

#### Discussion
This looks similar to #8541 and #10080, but I've filed it separately as there are two things on display here that I didn't see explicitly discussed in them:

- the lexicographic ordering of absolute paths to the files in question determines whether compilation will succeed or fail
- the sbt compiler can be put in an inconsistent state where an `sbt clean` changes whether compilation succeeds or fails.

I ran in to this in a very large codebase and had a very confusing time narrowing down the interactions that were causing it, since they turned out to involve a specific lexicographic ordering of two seemingly-unrelated parts of the codebase as well as one kind of compilation corrupting the compiler's state and causing another compilation to succeed or fail depending on whether an `sbt clean` was run.
