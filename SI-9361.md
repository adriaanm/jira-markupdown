The following will evince the compiler crash:

{code}
abstract class Foo[Tc[_]] { def tc: Tc[_] }
object Foo {
  def foo[Tc[_]](): Foo[Tc] { type T = Nothing } =
    new Foo { def tc = null.asInstanceOf[Tc[_]] }
}
{code}

It appears that in the absence of a type parameter to the `new Foo` instantiation, the type inferencer looks to the expected type of `foo` to try to infer it. In the presence of the type refinement in the expected type, this crashes the compiler.

This doesn't crash in Scala 2.10.6 (although it doesn't compile), but does with every version from a random sample of 2.11.x releases.

Could be related to SI-2712.
This regressed in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1564/files

I actually spotted one "non refactoring" amongst that patch when I originally reviewed it. The discussion seems to be lost in the ashes of paulp/scala, but I found this in my email:

With the current typer, they're the same thing. In some hypothetical future typer which doesn't mutate everything in place, only whereClauses1 is correct, because those are the trees which were just typed by typedStats. In principle they might not even be the same trees, although I don't think anyone is planning on a change like that.

I reverted that change and it doesn't fix the crash. So there must be another needle hidden in that haystack.
Based on the stack trace when the compiler crashes, I think I've stumbled across this same bug again, twice in a fortnight (on different projects). Common factor: me.

Here's a different, more complex (but still not easy to reduce much further) test case:

{code}
object Test {
  trait Foo {
    type Inner
    type Result = Ordering[Inner] // any invariant type constructor
    def get: Result
  }  

  trait Super
  trait Bar[T] extends Super { type Result = T }

  def wrap[V <: Super](v: V): Foo { type Inner = this.type with v.type } = ???
  
  val baz: Bar[_] = ???
  wrap(baz).get: Ordering[Foo { type Result = this.type }]
}
{code}

This version *does* appear to crash every version of the compiler between 2.10.3 and 2.12.0-M1.
