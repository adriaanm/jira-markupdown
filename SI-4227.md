Assigning to myself, I'm just opening some tickets for things I know about so I'm not the only one who knows.
Well, at least this is easy to reproduce.  Who can deduce this one.
{code}
% ./partest files/run/t3829.scala |& grep "files/run/t3829"
testing: [...]/files/run/t3829.scala                                  [  OK  ]

% JAVA_OPTS="-verbose" ./partest files/run/t3829.scala  |& grep "files/run/t3829"
testing: [...]/files/run/t3829.scala                                  [FAILED]
{code}
It is indeed failing; one can witness it throw an assertion error, and then it is reported as a success.

This is likely tied to either sys.process, my shotgun blasts into partest, or both.
Actually it's looking like option SI-3, the failing exit code being lost due to changes I made to the bash script in the service of not installing a shutdown hook for jline to restore terminal settings so that sbt wouldn't have a massive classloader leak due to jline's shutdown hook hanging onto everything.

OH WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE.
(In r24270) I chased a lot of ghosts before finding the real culprit
for why partest failures have been unfailing.

  Process(Seq("bash", "-c", "exit 42")) !             // 42
  Process(Seq("bash", "-c", "exit 42")) #> logFile !  // 0

That behavior is not yet fixed, but I altered partest not
to use #> and fixed the test which should have been failing
but wasn't.  Closes SI-4227, no review.
