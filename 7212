I am afraid there may be more consequences to non-deterministic access than this one.  And "contains a dollar sign" would ideally not be a condition upon which anything important is based.  Sometimes I wonder why we work so hard to finesse access when it can generally be evaded anyway.  Just for the sake of argument, what would the consequences be if we always generated public fields (under -optimise and not) for everything accessed from a method marked @inline?
