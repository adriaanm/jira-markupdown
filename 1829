"Is it possible to have a clearer message when this type of exception happens ?"

I'll trade you a clearer error message for at least a hint at what code induced it.  Stack traces aren't much help by themselves.

I would be very surprised if this was not a duplicate of SI-1896 which is fixed in r17719.
