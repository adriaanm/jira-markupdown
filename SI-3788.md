Scala 2.8.0 final,
JDK 1.6.0_20,
Ubuntu Linux 10.04

`CompileServer` uses `java.io.File.createTempFile` indirectly.

This `createTempFile` method takes 5 seconds on Linux because it uses `java.security.SecureRandom` which seems to use `/dev/random`.

So the first run of fsc is fail to start because `CompileClient` waits just 2 seconds for the spawned server, and in many cases fsc is slower than scalac because of this `createTempFile` problem it seems.

VM option `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom` can be used to avoid this delay. But this makes `SecureRandom` a little bit unsecure, which can be used to generate keys for security.

So it would be good to use an alternative to `java.io.File.createTempFile`, as the speed of the compiler is important.
(In r24494) Accumulated work on fsc.  Cleans up a bunch of things, and
adds the following new options.

  -ipv4          Use IPv4 rather than IPv6 for the server socket
  -absolute-cp   Make classpath elements absolute paths before sending to server
  -max-idle      Set idle timeout in minutes for fsc (use 0 for no timeout)

My question marks are what are the right defaults for the first two.
Former behavior is to absolutize the classpath always and never prefer
IPv4 sockets.  I changed the default to not absolutize the classpath,
with the option if you need it; I left the system default in place for
the socket creation, but I have a feeling we should default to IPv4.
My only hesitation is that the only way to request an IPv4 socket from
java involves mutating a global system property.  (Robustness FTW.)
So for now, you have to give -ipv4.
