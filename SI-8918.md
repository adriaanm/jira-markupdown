I saw someone reporting this on irc

val `-` = 2
`-`
1+1 // << illegal start of simple expression

val `+` = 2
$plus // << ok
1+1
why not ?

```
Finally, an identifier may also be formed by an arbitrary string between back-quotes (host systems may impose some restrictions on which strings are legal for identifiers). The identifier then is composed of all characters excluding the backquotes themselves.

I meant it in the sense of, "Mwa-ha-ha!" evil cackling.

But also, an id is an id.  Backquotes don't change anything here.  Reduced:

```scala
scala> val - = 2
-: Int = 2

scala> $minus
res0: Int = 2

scala> -  // newline or semi should disambiguate unary op
     | 1
<console>:2: error: illegal start of simple expression
       1
^

scala> -(      // contrast
     | 1
     | )
res3: Int = -1

```

where they must be followed by a simple expr to be taken as unary ops.
