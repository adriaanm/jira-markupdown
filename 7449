Actually, {{a}} and {{d}} have the same {{hashCode}}. It is {{##}} which returns different results than {{hashCode}} for boxed numeric types (and for {{null}}) as documented.

{code}
scala> val d = (BigInt(1) << 64).toDouble
d: Double = 1.8446744073709552E19

scala> val a: Any = d
a: Any = 1.8446744073709552E19

scala> d.hashCode
res22: Int = 1139802112

scala> a.hashCode
res23: Int = 1139802112
{code}

So if this behavior is changed, do not forget to update the docs of {{##}} as well.
