The test_match attachment minimized is:
{code}
  def foo(h: Any, t: List[Any]) = h match {
    case 5 :: _ => ()
    case List(from) => from
  }
{code}
This one is a buzzkill because it looks to arise from the pattern matcher cheating on case List(...) in a way it doesn't with anything else so as to offer the same performance (i.e. not use unapplySeq.) Thus there is special code for treating List like it's a series of :: and someone, me we can presume, has broken that code.

I'm not sure it's the same issue as the reporter's, except that the pattern matcher can legitimately be viewed as one giant issue.
