If Some("a") == "a', how do you propose to modify final class String such that "a" == Some("a") ? If you think equals calls can be intercepted selectively, there is ("a": Object) == (Some("a"): Object).  If you think we would rewrite every equals call to achieve this end, there is still a whole universe of java code we don't compile but must interoperate with.  It is not no problem.  (This is before getting to the fact that even if it were easy and imposed no cost, we wouldn't do it because it isn't true: Some(x) is not x.)
