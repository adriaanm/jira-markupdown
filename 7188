The error message is misleading, but you can override m2 with an object fine.  You just can't override a method returning "Int" with a method returning "m2.type".  And you have to override it.
```scala
class A2 {
  def m2: Any = 5
}
class B2 extends A2 {
  override object m2
}
```
I've fixed the overriding bug, will check in shortly.
