Today, I spend much time to find out why my reflection code does not work in REPL. And finally, I am sure that I had been cheated by REPL: 
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.7.0_09).

Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> """$line3.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$Hello, World"""
res0: String = Hello, World
```

I consider replacing `$line3.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$` trick as a bug, because it breaks reflect like `class Foo; Class.forName("Foo")` and make people confused.

I highly recommend to remove this trick.
