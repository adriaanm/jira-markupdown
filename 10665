```
Method foo is defined in class G and in class Z. Class G has companion object, which is inherited from Z. So according to SLS 6.26.3 class G is derived from class Z.
```

I believe you have misinterpreted 6.26.3.
```
A class or object C is derived from a class or object D if one of the following holds:
• C is a subclass of D,or
• C is a companion object of a class derived from D, or
• D is a companion object of a class from which C is derived.
```

 1. class G is not a subclass of class G
 2. G is not an object
 3. Z is not an object
