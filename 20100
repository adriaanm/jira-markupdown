I have a package object with many bad links in it bad only the first is reported. I know this by cycling the order of the bad links in the source.
```scala
/** The package object `scala.math` contains methods for performing basic
  * numeric operations such as elementary exponential, logarithmic, root and
  * trigonometric functions.
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce]] - it works
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce gg]] - it works
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce!.max]]
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce!.max*]]
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce.max*]]
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce!.max aa]]
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce!.max* bb]]
  *
  * Test: [[scala.collection.TraversableOnce.max* cc]]
  */
```

I redirect `sbt doc > sbt.out`

then search for link errors in math/package.scala but only see one. There should be six.
```scala
22:09 $ grep math/package sbt.out
[warn] /home/jdb/workspaces/public/scala/src/library/scala/math/package.scala:11: Could not find any member to link for "scala.collection.TraversableOnce!.max".
```

This will be masking other errors.
