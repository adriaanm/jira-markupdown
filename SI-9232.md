The following code compiles without any warning:
{code:scala}
package test

final class Foo(val value: Int)
object Foo {
  def unapplySeq(foo: Foo): Some[Seq[Int]] = Some(List(foo.value))
  /*def unapply(foo: Foo): Some[Int] = Some(foo.value)*/
}

sealed trait Tree
case class Node1(foo: Foo) extends Tree
case class Node2() extends Tree

object Test {
  def transformTree(tree: Tree): Any = tree match {
    case Node1(Foo(1)) => ???
  }
}
{code}

But if you uncomment {{unapply}}, you get:
{code:scala}
test2.scala:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: Node1(_), Node2()
  def transformTree(tree: Tree): Any = tree match {
                                       ^
one warning found
{code}

It'd be nice to give the same warnings when only {{unapplySeq}} is used, for example with {{List}}.
I did not mention it explicitely but replacing {{transformTree}} with:

{code:scala}
  def transformTree(tree: Tree): Any = tree match {
    case Node1(_) => ???
  }
{code}

Also produces the warnings you'd expect:
{code:scala}
test2.scala:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: Node2()
  def transformTree(tree: Tree): Any = tree match {
                                       ^
one warning found
{code}
Which is why I'm saying that having {{unapplySeq}} without {{unapply}} somehow silences even unrelated exhaustivity warnings
Extractor patterns within a pattern match typically disable analysis of exhaustivity and reachability. There is a special case for `unapply` methods that are irrefutable, that is, they statically return `Some[T]` rather than just `Option[T]`. Such patterns are considered to always match for the purposes of analysis.

Guards similarly hamper analysis:

{code}
object Test {
  def noWarningHere(x: Option[Any]): Any = x match {
    case Some(1) if "".isEmpty => ???
  }
}
{code}

Oh, I knew that this happened with guard but not with extractors. I think that two things need to be done at least:
- Have a warning (even an optional one) when the exhaustivity/reachability analysis is disabled.
- Try to do "best effort" analysis, e.g. in your example, replace {{case Some(1) if "".isEmpty}} by {{case Some(1)}} to do a partial analysis, or in my example replace {{case Node1(Foo(1))}} by {{case Node1(_)}}, this would already improve things a lot.

The warning is especially important because a type system is much more useful when it is reliable, it's hard to rely on the exhaustiveness checker because it's so easy to accidentally disable it.

I agree.
See also SI-5365 re guards disabling exhaustivity analysis. I don't see why they need to.
