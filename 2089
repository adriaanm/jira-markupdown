(In r23207) An obviously wrong yet somehow brilliant piece of code
uncommenting.  References scala/bug#2171 without fixing it.  Removes
the non-termination which had caused me to revert r23174, which
itself immediately follows this patch.  No review (but iulian
says he will look at this situation somewhere down the line.)
