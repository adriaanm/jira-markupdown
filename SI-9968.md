I'd like to be able to say

{code}
{ case Good(whatever) => whatever }.andThen { case Even(num) => println("it's even!") }
{code}

But if I use this, although it makes a PartialFunction, it doesn't do what I want it to.  In particular, it will tell me that it's defined at Good(3).  This is because it inherits andThen from Function, and so it takes a Function as its argument.

I think overloading andThen to take a PartialFunction would be pretty disruptive, so I propose two better ways forward:

A.  provide a `compose` method on the PartialFunction object (somewhat confusing because there is also a compose method on the PartialFunction instance, but its behavior is not what we want for composing two PFs)
B.  change andThen to inspect the other function, and if it's a PartialFunction, upgrade its behavior.  (this is a thrilling runtime change, and makes its behavior inconsistent).

What do you think?
Some of the hoops people jump through to try to do this themselves:

For what it's worth, I typically provide

{code}
def composePartial[A, B, C](left: PartialFunction[A, B], right: PartialFunction[B, C]): PartialFunction[A, C] = {
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean = left.isDefinedAt(a) && right.isDefinedAt(left(a))
  def apply(a: A): C = left(right(a))
}
{code}

at the call site and just hate myself.
