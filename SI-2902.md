I've tried both getting a vanilla eclipse and a distribution from yoxus. In both cases I have the spring tools plugin and the scala plugin. The scala plugin is 2.8.0.r20326-b20091229020159

When I create a new scala class, the file is opened in the Java editor, even when the 'open with' radio mark is for 'scala editor'. Naturally, this causes a lot of squiggly lines. 
Sorry, I misread. In that case this is a duplicate of #2745.
