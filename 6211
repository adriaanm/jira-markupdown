Section 4.6.2:
{noformat}
Methods with repeated parameters T * take a variable number of arguments of type T.
That is, if a method m with type (p1:T1,...,pn:Tn,ps:S*)U isappliedtoarguments(e1,...,ek)wherek≥n,
then m is taken in that application to have type (p1 : T1,...,pn : Tn,ps : S,...,ps′S)U,
with k − n occurrences of type S where any parameter names beyond ps are fresh.
{noformat}
To my eye that excerpt definitively marks this as a bug.  "m is taken in that application to have type" (Y)Int.  (X)Int vs. (Y)Int, being applied to Y, where Y extends X.
