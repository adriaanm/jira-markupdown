For some collection classes, the companion method does not work as documented and expected. One of these is immutable.Map:
```scala
scala> val m = Map()
m: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Nothing,Nothing] = Map()

scala> m.companion
res0: scala.collection.generic.GenericCompanion[scala.collection.immutable.Iterable] = scala.collect
ion.immutable.Iterable$$@129dcc0
```
