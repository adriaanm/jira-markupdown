In the past few months I have sometimes wanted a "{{takeTo}}" method, which would take all elements up to and including the first for which a predicate was true. Or, in other words, the following equivalency would be true:

{code}
collection.takeTo(p) == collection.takeWhile(!p).init
{code}

I haven't found easy way to simulate such method using the existing ones. I have either used {{sliding}}, with the inconvenients it presents, or simply went about my code in a completely different manner.

So I ask for this method to be added. The name I propose is based on the {{until}}/{{to}} distinction used for ranges.

I hope this wasn't decided because of my misrepresentation of semantics? The equality I intended was

{code}
collection.takeTo(p).init == collection.takeWhile(!p)
{code}

Though I only now realize I mistyped it.

I realized I never gave a correct definition, so here it is.

{code}
def takeTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val (before, after) = this span p
  before :+ after.head
}

def dropTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = this dropWhile p tail

def spanTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val (before, after) = this span p
  (before :+ after.head, after.tail)
}
{code}
