In the past few months I have sometimes wanted a "{{takeTo}}" method, which would take all elements up to and including the first for which a predicate was true. Or, in other words, the following equivalency would be true:

```scala
collection.takeTo(p) == collection.takeWhile(!p).init
```

I haven't found easy way to simulate such method using the existing ones. I have either used `sliding`, with the inconvenients it presents, or simply went about my code in a completely different manner.

So I ask for this method to be added. The name I propose is based on the `until`/`to` distinction used for ranges.
I hope this wasn't decided because of my misrepresentation of semantics? The equality I intended was

```scala
collection.takeTo(p).init == collection.takeWhile(!p)
```

Though I only now realize I mistyped it.
I realized I never gave a correct definition, so here it is.

```scala
def takeTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val (before, after) = this span p
  before :+ after.head
}

def dropTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = this dropWhile p tail

def spanTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val (before, after) = this span p
  (before :+ after.head, after.tail)
}
```
