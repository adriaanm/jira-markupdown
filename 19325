AFAICS, dealiasing a type lambda seems broken:

I've probably misunderstood something (and lost the link to the Jenkins failure, thanks Github).

In that PR, Jason resorted to working around the bug with:
```scala
if (tp.dealias.isInstanceOf[RefinedType]) tp.dealias else tp
```
on this line:
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3981/files#diff-ecaa4198a04261cd0e00a708b695eafbR1605

I want to record this for posterity, for macro authors to work around, and hopefully for somebody to actually fix.
(I might be missing some detail, but nobody pointed out any mistake yet).
