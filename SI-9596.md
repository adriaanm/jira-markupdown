Scaladoc seems to be in two minds with regard to protected members.

- From the `# A .. Z deprecated` list I pick `S`
- Scroll down to `seedvalue`
- Click on `FlatHashTable`
- Do a browser page search for `seedvalue` -> {color:red}Not found{color}
- Click link to source: Found `@transient protected var seedvalue: Int = tableSizeSeed`

## Index Listing

```scala
seedvalue
