An important remark about the docs:
```
The current documentation for blocking says that it now only is intended to cover external blocking APIs, and that Await.result should be used directly instead.
```

No, it says that you should use `blocking` to designate code that potentially blocks. It does not matter if the code blocks due to `Thread.sleep`, `Await.result` or an I/O operation - these are all examples of blocking.

It also says that waiting until a `Future` object is complete (to get its value) should be done with `Await.result`.
