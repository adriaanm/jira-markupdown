Sorry I was wrong in my last comment. This bug is still valid in r20019 so please ignore my last comment.

The problem with my testing was that I already had a companion object defined and to test this issue I just commented out the companion object and saved the file. Because of scala/bug#2443 Eclipse's model did not get updated correctly so I was still seeing the correct hover because Eclipse believed the the companion object still existed.
