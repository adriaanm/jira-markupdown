No unchecked warning for the 2ed clause:
{code}
class A[K] {
  def receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = {
    case ds: List[Double] =>  // unchecked warning
      println("* List[Double]")
    case kx: Vector[K] =>      // no unchecked warning
      println("* Vector[K]")
  }
}
{code}
Only the 1st unchecked warning is produced: 
{noformat}
$ scalac A.scala
A.scala:3: warning: non-variable type argument Double in type pattern List[Double] (the underlying of List[Double]) is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
    case ds: List[Double] =>
{noformat}
Ooops, I just opened SI-9188 for this.
