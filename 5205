And perhaps even more bizarrely the following is also accepted,
```scala
scala> class Up { def update(as : Int*)(d : Double) {} }
defined class Up

scala> val up = new Up                                  
up: Up = Up@1890c67

scala> (up(0) = 1)(1.0)                                 
```

I'm sure someone can find something useful to do with this.
