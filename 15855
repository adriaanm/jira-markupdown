With 2.8.1-final, code:
```scala
class A(val f : String)

class B(a : Option[String], f : String) extends A(f) {
  a match {
    case Some(`f`) => print(f)
  }
}
```

Causes the compiler to throw `scala.MatchError: B.super.f().asInstanceOf[java.lang.String]`

I think this code ought to compile. It seems to be upset that `Some(`f`)` refers to the constructor argument f which is shadowing the inherited val f.
