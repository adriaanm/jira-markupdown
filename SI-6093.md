The draft of September 28, 2011 (which is newer than what's on scala-lang) declares opchar as "all other chracters in \u0020-007F and Unicode categories Sm, So except parentheses ([]) and periods".

None of the previous definitions includes space (\u0020), so it would follow that space is a valid opchar.
The spec now says:
{code}
1. Whitespace characters. `\u0020 | \u0009 | \u000D | \u000A`.
[â€¦]
1. Operator characters. These consist of all printable ASCII characters
   `\u0020 - \u007F` which are in none of the sets above, mathematical symbols (`Sm`)
   and other symbols (`So`).
{code}
