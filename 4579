I hesitate to even put a toe in this water, but: vars with private setters and public getters are something I'm pretty sure everyone wishes were a lot easier to come by than they are.  The boilerplate tax is presently in the triple digits.  The case class issues all vanish if we have a simple way to achieve that.  :: is welcome to its access restricted vars so long as those restrictions only apply to the setters.  "All case class first argument list *getters* must be public" is just as good, and might even be better.
