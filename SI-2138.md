When generating strings for an XML, each element has its scope -- a NamespaceBinding object -- compared to that of its parent. If they aren't equal, a namespace is added to the string representation of that element.

Unfortunately, NamespaceBinding does define an "equals" method, which means reference equality is used, with unfortunate consequences. Any code that does not cache Namespaces will end up producing XMLs which repeat the namespace.

NamespaceBinding is composed of two strings and a NamespaceBinding, so an equals method can be trivially defined for it.
