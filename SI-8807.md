The presentation compiler reports the type-mismatch error at an offset position, causing the error annotation in the IDE to be just one character.

For example,

{code}
  val foo: List[Int] = List(1).map(_.toString)
{code}

Will issue the error at the application of `map`, using an offset position.

The alternative is to parse around that point in the IDE, but the proper solution would be to use a range position.

I investigated a bit and here's what I found:

* the tree position is already an offset position at the point where the error is issued
* the offset position is related to filled-in implicits. The following code shows the same positioning (though simpler example, with type parameters or not, position the error at a range)

{code}
  def bar(x: Int)(implicit imp: Int) = x
  
  implicit val impimp = 42  
  val sss: String = bar(1)
{code}

Further info: the typer has a second try at finding implicits, and uses duplicated trees. It looks like the duplicator focuses positions, and [~burmako] might know more about it. In 75b44a6 a new `duplicateAndKeepPositions` method is added, but the typer doesn't use it in this case. Could that be it?
