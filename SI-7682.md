The new `:edit` command doesn't like console editors, as foretold.

We will repair this usability deficit.


I'll need some info, since the use case was just to default to :line behavior, which is to put the lines at the end of history so at least you can up-arrow to them.

```scala

1441  val i = 8
1442  :hi

scala> :ed 1441-
Placing text in recent history.

scala> :hi
[snip]
1441  val i = 8
1442  :hi
1443  :ed 1441-
1444  val i = 8
1445  :hi

scala> :q
apm@mara:~/tmp$ echo $EDITOR

apm@mara:~/tmp$ 
```

Maybe the EDITOR isn't actually unset, but is garbage? etc.
DAMN, yes EDITOR was not unset. It pointed to vim which couldn't be loaded. After I unset the variable everything works fine.

I'll close the ticket but if you want you can take a look at the exception that occurs when EDITOR points to an editor that does not exist:

```
java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "": error=2, No such file or directory
```
I was so excited to stumble on the :edit command, and then so confused when it just hung the REPL (with EDITOR=vim).
