Martin, I think this is because of this case in the erasure type map:

{code}
        case st: SubType => // map a TypeBounds to a TypeRef (typically)
          apply(st.supertype)
{code}

the `BoundedWildcardType` case in `mapOver` in `TypeMap` requires `TypeBounds` to be mapped to `TypeBounds`

We've probably starting hitting this path because of r19769, which fixed SI-2635 

I'm not sure what the erasure of a `BoundedWildcardType` should be, so assigning to you.
