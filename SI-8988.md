Calling String.split with a character (e.g. String.split('\t')) escapes the character when converting it to a String (from StringLike.scala):

{code}
  @throws(classOf[java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException])
  def split(separator: Char): Array[String] = toString.split(escape(separator))

  private def escape(ch: Char): String = "\\Q" + ch + "\\E"
{code}

Java 7 includes performance optimizations for String.split: when called with a single character that is not a regex, an optimized code path will be used. Escaping the the character as done in StringLike.split(c) will break this optimization.

Workaround: call String.split("\t") instead of String.split('\t') which does not escape the character and prevent usage of optimized code path.

Are you guys working on this?

I did some speed testing, even with JDK 1.6 (still the standard right).
The results surprised me.

split("\t") is meaningfully faster than split('\t') for all the special characters.
Even split('\t'.toString) is faster than our current implementation of split('\t')
