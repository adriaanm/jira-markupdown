This example is taken from my comments in #5189:
```scala
trait Covariant[+A]
val arr = Array("abc")
case class Invariant[A](xs: Array[A]) extends Covariant[A]
def f[A](v: Covariant[A]) = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
f(Invariant(arr): Covariant[Any])(0) = Nil
```
That is a soundness hole in every version of scala. It is interesting to note however that through scala 2.9.2, you could write f in either of these ways, and it would still compile unsoundly:
```scala
def f[A](v: Covariant[A]) = v match { case Invariant(xs) => (xs: Array[A]) }
def f[A](v: Covariant[A]): Array[A] = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
```
In scala 2.10 those versions no longer compile, BUT the unsound type could still be inferred! My certainty that this is not the only example of that motivates this separate ticket.
```scala
// scala 2.10
scala> def f[A](v: Covariant[A]): Array[A] = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Array[?A1] where type ?A1 <: A (this is a GADT skolem)
 required: Array[A]
Note: ?A1 <: A, but class Array is invariant in type T.
You may wish to investigate a wildcard type such as `_ <: A`. (SLS 3.2.10)
       def f[A](v: Covariant[A]): Array[A] = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
                                                                             ^
scala> def f[A](v: Covariant[A]) = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
f: [A](v: Covariant[A])Array[A]
```
Definitely see also #5585.
One does not need an invariant class to trigger this, nor arrays. Here's a reduced version, inspired to what happens in Lightweight Modular Staging:
```scala
object MinimalUnsoundness {
  trait Exp[+T]
  case class Const[+T](t: T) extends Exp[T] //Making Const invariant makes no difference.
  def interp[T](term: Exp[T]): T =
    term match {
      case Const(t) => t //This should be rejected...
    }

  //Because classes like this can be declared:
  class MyConst(t: String) extends Const[Any](t) with Exp[Boolean]
}
//At the REPL:
scala> import MinimalUnsoundness._
import MinimalUnsoundness._

scala> :type interp(new MyConst(""))
Boolean

scala> interp(new MyConst(""))
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean
```
In the actual code, I want to prevent declaring classes like `MyConst`, so that `interp` is actually accepted, and making `Const` final is often not an option, but that's another story.

A more complete example - an interpreter for embedded simply-typed lambda-calculus with subtyping:

```scala
trait Lambda {
  trait Exp[+T]
  case class Const[T](t: T) extends Exp[T]
  case class App[S, T](fun: Exp[S => T], arg: Exp[S]) extends Exp[T]
  case class Fun[S, T](body: Exp[S] => Exp[T]) extends Exp[S => T]
}

trait Interp extends Lambda {
  def interp[T](term: Exp[T]): T =
    term match {
      case Const(t) => t //Unsound!
      case App(fun, arg) =>
        interp(fun) apply interp(arg) //Unsound!
      case f: Fun[s, t] =>
        //(x: s) => interp(f.body(Const(x)))
        (((x: s) => interp(f.body(Const(x)))): (s => t)).asInstanceOf[T] //What I have to write
      //case Fun(body) =>
        //x => interp(body(Const(x)))
    }
}

object Language extends Lambda with Interp {
  //Demonstrate why all the above branches can trigger an error.
  class MyFun[T]() extends Fun[T, T](x => x) with Exp[runtime.AbstractFunction1[T, T]]
  class MyApp[T](t: T) extends App[Int, List[T]](Fun(x => Const(List(t))), Const(1)) with Exp[Nil.type]
  class MyConst(t: String) extends Const[Any](t) with Exp[Boolean]

  println(interp(new MyApp(1))) //This works thanks to heap pollution
  println("""Executing 'interp(new MyApp(1))' in the REPL won't work -
    |you'll get a ClassCastException""".stripMargin)
  println("""Same for 'interp(new MyConst(""))'""")
}
```
Upon closer observation, the bug you describe is different from the one I mentioned. Moreover, the one you describe cannot be reproduced any more in 2.10.2. Now we get:
```scala
scala> def f[A](v: Covariant[A]) = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
f: [A](v: Covariant[A])Array[_ <: A]
```
hence the soundness hole you describe does not show up:
```scala
scala> f(Invariant(arr): Covariant[Any])(0) = Nil
<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.immutable.Nil.type
 required: ?A1 where type ?A1
              f(Invariant(arr): Covariant[Any])(0) = Nil
                                                     ^
```

But the type of `f` is still very bad, and I can use the technique of my example:

```scala
class Bad extends Invariant[Any](Array(1, 2, 3)) with Covariant[Boolean]

scala> f(new Bad)
res3: Array[_ <: Boolean] = Array(1, 2, 3) //What???

scala> res3(0)
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean
<BOOM>
```

Should I open another bug and close this one?
Amazing. Unlike I said, using an invariant class (here, arrays, which **force** `Invariant` to be invariant) makes a difference.

Usually, to fix the bug I mentioned, the compiler should deduce not `?A1 <: A` (as in your error, which I repasted below) but `?A1 >: A`. But because arrays are involved, it's not clear whether the compiler can deduce a constraint between `?A1` and `A`. On pen and paper, I could only deduce that if the most specific solution for `v` is `Covariant[A2]`, then `A2 <: ?A1` and `A2 <: A`. You can only set `A2 = ?A1`, giving `?A1 <: A`, if you forbid the definition of `Bad`, as done by one sentence in the paper on case classes and extractors, "Matching objects with patterns", ECOOP 2007, by Burak Emir, Martin Odersky and John Williams. However, forbidding that definition will break valid code that doesn't care about pattern matching.

```scala
// scala 2.10
scala> def f[A](v: Covariant[A]): Array[A] = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Array[?A1] where type ?A1 <: A (this is a GADT skolem)
 required: Array[A]
Note: ?A1 <: A, but class Array is invariant in type T.
You may wish to investigate a wildcard type such as `_ <: A`. (SLS 3.2.10)
       def f[A](v: Covariant[A]): Array[A] = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
                                                                             ^
```
