(In r24211) The comment for isCoDefinedWith has long said

  Is this symbol defined in the same scope
  and compilation unit as `that' symbol?

But "same scope" was never checked, only "same compilation unit."
Presumably other layers of logic kept this from being noticed until
now, but it has been crashing sbt.  Added check to isCoDefinedWith.
Closes SI-4220, review by odersky.
