Note to self: Zaugg says, with respect to type inference on partial function literals:
```scala
Let's just agree that you'd be considered a light-year more awesome if
you could train the compiler to say "Please see ï¿½8.5 of the Scala
Reference" rather than the blather about x0$$1 and expanded functions.
```
Clearly this suggestion has priority since it comes with a quantified awesomeness increase.
