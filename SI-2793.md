Using Scala version 2.8.0.r20087-b20091210111324 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

Given A.scala, B.scala:
```scala
object A {
  def x: List[Int] = List(3)
}
object B {
  val y: List[Int] = A.x
}
```

 1. Compile
 1. Modify A.scala to change the return type of x from List[Int] to List[String]
```scala
object A {
  def x: List[String] = List("3")
}
```
 1. Mark A.scala updated.  B is not recompiled because the build manager does not detect a type change in the return type.
 1. The expected error occurs when B.scala is explicitly marked as updated:
```scala
B.scala:2: error: type mismatch;
 found   : List[String]
 required: List[Int]
        val y: List[Int] = A.x
                             ^
```

It appears that types are being compared after erasure.  If this is true, fixing this might also fix #2650, #2651, #2652, #2653.
(In r20376) Closes #2793, #2651, #2650, #2653. Review by dragos.
(In r20404) Improvements in checking for references during dependency analysis. For example more carefully analysis of abstract type members, typerefs etc. References #2793. review by dragos.
