In following snippet:

```scala
object OhNoes {

  sealed trait F
  sealed abstract class FA extends F
  sealed abstract class FB extends F

  case object FA1 extends FA
  case object FB1 extends FB
  case object FB2 extends FB

  sealed trait G
  case object G1 extends G
  case object G2 extends G

  sealed trait H
  case class H1(a: FB, b: G) extends H
  case class H2(a: F)        extends H

  val demo: H => Unit = {
    case H1(FB1, G1) =>
    case H1(FB2, G2) =>
    case H2(_: FB) =>
    case H2(_: FA) =>
    case H1(FB1, G2) =>
    case H1(FB2, G1) =>
  }
}
```

the naughty little compiler lies and reports:

```
[warn] /tmp/ah/demo.scala:23: unreachable code
[warn]     case H2(_: FA) =>
```

Very interestingly, H1 and H2 both having a parameter with the same name seems to be pertinent. If you rename H2's "a" to "b" you get a different (incorrect) warning:

```
[warn] It would fail on the following input: H2(_)
[warn]   val demo: H => Unit = {
```

Renaming H2's "a" to "x" the warnings disappear.

Finally, rearranging the order of cases produces different, incorrect warnings, likely related to #9399 and #9398. Example:

```scala
  val demo2: H => Unit = {
    case H2(_: FA) =>
    case H2(_: FB) =>
    case H1(FB1, G1) =>
    case H1(FB2, G1) =>
    case H1(FB1, G2) =>
    case H1(FB2, G2) =>
  }
```

produces

```
[warn] It would fail on the following inputs: H1(_, G1), H1(_, G2)
[warn]   val demo2: H => Unit = {
```
