I have a trait defined as
```scala
trait Thing { def name: String }
```

I'm trying to stack it using
```scala
val t = new Thing with Thing1 with Thing2
```

where Thing1 and Thing2 are defined as
```scala
trait Thing1 extends Thing { override lazy val name = "One" }
trait Thing2 extends Thing { abstract override lazy val name = super.name }
```

I'm getting a StackOverflowError when trying to access t.name.  This happens with both Scala 2.9.0.Beta1 and the March 9th nightly build.
```scala
