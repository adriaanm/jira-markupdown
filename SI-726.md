```scala
 scala> Array(List(1))
 res0: Array[List[Int]] = Array(List(1))
```

so far, so good. but then:

```scala
 scala> List(Array(1))
 res1: List[Array[Int]] = List([I@a12355)
```

yuck! I hope there isn't some inherent Java/Scala friction that prevents the expected output from being produced?

(In r20740) Solidified the logic of stringOf for repl results printing.
