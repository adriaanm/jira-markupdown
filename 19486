Scala 2.11 warns about pure expressions in statement position. This warning is incorrect for volatile reads. A volatile read has the side-effect of inserting a memory read barrier (which must not be optimized away by the JIT even when the actual read is unnecessary and can be removed).
```scala
[warn] /Users/szeiger/code/slick/src/main/scala/scala/slick/backend/DatabaseComponent.scala:190: a pure expression does nothing in statement position; you may be omitting necessary parentheses
[warn]             ctx.sync
[warn]                 ^
```
