Control characters (other than \r, \n and \t) are illegal in XML.  The Utility.escape method does not filter these characters, leading to illegal XML.

The enclosed patch filters control characters from XML output and improves performance over the 2.7.7 implementation by 3x and the 2.8 implementation by 4x (as benchmarked by the attached file)

(In r20780) Fixed XML Utility.escape method to conform to XML spec.  Closes SI-3014
