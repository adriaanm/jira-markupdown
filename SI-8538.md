Should we (at least) deprecate the part of BufferedSource that doesn't make sense without Position?

Alan Burlison reports on scala-user:

My 2.10.4 project was extending BufferedSource so it could override the report method and handle the error messages differently. The 'pos' parameter contains the line & column of the error encoded inside a single int. That needed to be picked apart using the Position class, and Position has now been deprecated AND made private inside the scala namespace.

Deprecating things is fine, doing so whilst still providing non-deprecated public APIs that require use of them isn't and making them package-private is positively hostile. I've hacked around this using RelaxedPosition - but then I have no idea why RelaxedPosition hasn't been deprecated when Position has.

The correct way to extend Source is to supply a Positioner.

It's not obvious that Source should have reporting duties, but one could upgrade it in future to use Reporter.
