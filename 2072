It seems that we speak about two different problems in this ticket:

No. 1: Pattern matching is not able to accept element names plus attributes.
Test case:

{code}
val xml = <a anyAttr="0815">some text</a>
xml match {
  // Next statement will not compile. Remove attribute and it will
  // compile (2.7.7). Is the result correct (matching regardless of attribute)?  
  case <a anyAttr="0815">{content}</a>     => println("   match: " + content)
  case other                               => println("no match: " + other)
}
{code}
This is first a problem of the compiler and second a possible problem of undefined behaviour.

No.2: Namespace problems because of recognition only prefixes and not URI's (as discussed by Stefan Zeiger and others in the link to nabble.com).
