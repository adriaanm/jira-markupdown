It seems that the self-type annotation shadows constructor arguments.

scala> trait Y
defined trait Y

scala> abstract class X(x: Int) { self: Y => x }
<console>:6: error: not found: value x
       abstract class X(x: Int) { self: Y => x }
                                             ^
{code}

Of course, without self-type annotation, there is no problem,
{code}
scala> abstract class X(x: Int) { self => x }
defined class X
{code}
and curiously there is no problem with 'val',
{code}
scala> abstract class X(val x: Int) { self: Y => x }
defined class X
{code}

This problem, for example, will cause the following unexpected result,
{code}
scala> object X {
     |   val x: Int = 1
     |   trait Y
     |   abstract class XX(x: Int){ self: Y =>
     |     println(x)
     |   }
     |   new XX(2) with Y
     | }
defined module X
scala> X
1
res0: X.type = X$$@1df3082
{code}
