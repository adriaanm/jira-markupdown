If we're intentionally allowing for changes in program behavior, it needs clearer documentation.  If not, this is a bug: under -optimise the body of Foo never runs.

{code}
// a.scala
// Sun Aug 21 15:56:03 PDT 2011

object Test extends App {
  for (i <- 0 to 1) {
    val a = Foo
  }
}

object Foo {
  println("hello")
}
{code}

The problem is that DCE considers the following instructions in {{Test$delayedInit$body.apply()}} to be redundant, and removes them:

{noformat}
    7	LOAD_MODULE object Foo
    7	STORE_LOCAL(variable a1)
{noformat}

Compiling with all optimizations except DCE ( {{-Yinline -Yinline-handlers -Yclosure-elim}} ) doesn't show this bug.


The instructions above are also removed in DCE from {{Test$$anonfun$1.apply$mcVI$sp(v1: Int (INT))}}
My first attempt at detecting {{LOAD_MODULE}} that DCE can eliminate:

{noformat}
    case LOAD_MODULE(mdl) =>
      // TODO a Dataflow Analysis could track on which paths the class initializer has been run.
      val necessary = mdl.info.member(nme.CONSTRUCTOR).filter(isSideEffecting) != NoSymbol
      if(necessary) { worklist += ((bb, idx)) }
{noformat}

But it also considers {{Predef}} as "necessary". Ideas?


I guess there's no ready-to-use analysis taking an {{IMethod}} and reporting whether it's (conservatively) pure. Perhaps the idea come up before?
I started a while back; I pushed it in case it's useful.

But as you discovered, pretty much every file anywhere appears side effecting until we know the loading of Predef$.MODULE$ is not side effecting, and short of special-casing it that raises the bar before we can get anything useful at all.
