LinkedHashMap.keys returns the keys of the map in insertion order, but if that collection is manipulated in any way, it reverts to an unordered Set.

This is somewhat surprising, particularly as keys is Iterable.

scala> val m = scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3, "four" -> 4, "five" -> 5)

scala> m.keys
res0: Iterable[java.lang.String] = Set(one, two, three, four, five)

scala> m.keys.drop(0)
res1: Iterable[java.lang.String] = Set(four, three, two, five, one)
