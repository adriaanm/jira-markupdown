I'd like to have Iterator.flatten in the same way that we have Iterable.flatten:
```scala
scala> val x = List(Some(1), None, Some(2))
x: List[Option[Int]] = List(Some(1), None, Some(2))

scala> x.flatten
res2: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> x.iterator.flatten
<console>:7: error: value flatten is not a member of Iterator[Option[Int]]
       x.iterator.flatten
```

Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like this could follow pretty much the same approach as the Iterable.flatten implementation:
```scala
scala> def flatten[A,B](iter: Iterator[A])(implicit asTraversableOnce: (A) => TraversableOnce[B]): Iterator[B] = for (x <- iter; y <- x.toIterator) yield y
flatten: [A,B](iter: Iterator[A])(implicit asTraversableOnce: (A) => TraversableOnce[B])Iterator[B]

scala> flatten(x.iterator)
res4: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> flatten(x.iterator).toList
res5: List[Int] = List(1, 2)
```
You are missing something, namely that there is already flatten on Iterator.  Your example is mixing and matching from Traversable and Iterator.
```scala
scala> val x = List(Some(1), None, Some(2))
x: List[Option[Int]] = List(Some(1), None, Some(2))

scala> x map (_.iterator)
res0: List[Iterator[Int]] = List(non-empty iterator, empty iterator, non-empty iterator)

scala> res0.iterator.flatten
res1: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> res1.toList
res2: List[Int] = List(1, 2)
```
I already implemented a generalization which allows this to work, but martin says it has to wait until 2.9.

You can use it now if you want:
