When I use this method from Libgdx library: http://tinyurl.com/assetmanager-get with Java signature
{code}
public synchronized <T> T get (String fileName)
{code}
I'm getting dead code warning when compiled under Scala 2.10.3 with -Ywarn-dead-code option:
{code}
dead code following this construct
[warn]       val asset = assetManager.get(name)
[warn]                                   ^
{code}
(asset is used further in code, and works as expected).

Adding even basic "Any" type information, like
{code}
val asset: Any = assetManager.get(name)
{code}
silences the warning. 

I asked this on scala-user ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-user/npN5v00SehU ) and was asked to open bug report here.
