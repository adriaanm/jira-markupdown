(extempore in [r25831|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25831]) Fix regression in companion check.

Pulling back from expensive path normalization caused a regression
where companions were no longer recognized as such after specialization.
(Specifically, the paths turned up as "test.scala" and "./test.scala".)
I made it a two-level check, doing the expensive one before failing.
Closes SI-5023, no review.
