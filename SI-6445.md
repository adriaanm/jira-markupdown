_this_ is a stable identifier (one of the stablest IMHO) and qualifing it with backticks should work in pattern matches, but currently doesn't:

{code}
scala> new AnyRef { this match { case `this` => println("foo") } }
<console>:27: error: not found: value this
              new AnyRef { this match { case `this` => println("foo") } }

{code}
The spec suggests otherwise:

{quote}
A stable identifier is a path which ends in an identifier.
{quote}

{code}
Path     ::= StableId
           | [id ‘.’] this
StableId ::= id
           | Path ‘.’ id
{code}
