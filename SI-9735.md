If starting the REPL session with `-Xno-uescape`, the REPL becomes unusable:

```
x:\Scala\scala-2.12.0-M4\bin>scala -Xno-uescape
Welcome to Scala 2.12.0-M4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_74).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> object A
<console>:10: error: invalid escape character
+ "defined object " + "A" + "\u000A"
                              ^
```

The problem can be traced to `scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.ReplStrings.string2code(str: String)` which invokes `Chars.char2uescape(c)` on any control character.

A proposed fix would be to inline control characters' integer values and circumvent said escaping altogether. 

Here is a quick hack which seems to do the trick via a specialized pattern match on the unix newline `\n` instead of `\u000A`
