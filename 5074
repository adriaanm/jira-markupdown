No, the addition is done and gone when that message is emitted.  It is saying you can't assign a Long to an Int.  Like this.
```scala
scala> 1L: Int
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long(1L)
 required: Int
       1L: Int
       ^
```
An Int really is required when you have a variable and it's an Int.
```scala
scala> var x: Int = 1L
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long(1L)
 required: Int
       var x: Int = 1L
                    ^
```
But an Int is not required when you are just looking for something to which you can add a Long, so we can't say "required: Int."
