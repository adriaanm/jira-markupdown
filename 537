Hi Stï¿½phane,

Thank you for the script. May I suggest that you include it in the Scala distribution? I think it will be useful to most people.

I understand that the change was approved by the Scala team, however I still don't understand the rationale behind it. For users like me, it looks like a step backwards: installing Scala now has become harder on Unix systems than it was before, and actually harder than other open source programs (for which a `configure --prefix <prefix> && make install` does the trick). Of course, a script like the one you attached helps, but first of all it does not seem to be widely available, and second it wasn't necessary with the old organisation.

I feel there must be a good reason for the change but I can't see it, so I would be very happy if you could enlighten me. Thanks in advance!

(As an aside: the only reason I can imagine is that the organisation on Unix is now closer to the one on Windows. However, the match is not perfect since, according to <1>, there are still differences between the two distributions, like the `man` directory or the presence of `.bat` files. And talking about `.bat` files, I notice that they are now also included in the `bin` directory of the Unix distribution, which isn't documented in <1> and which, once again, does not look like an improvement to my eyes).
