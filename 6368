Hello.  Thanks for commenting to my patch.  However, I couldn't understand that my patch breaks the lazyness of stream for the initial element.  If you don't mind, I would like to see concrete example of it.

I think that it isn't big problem, too.  However, I think that Iterator#next is **not** to expected consume O(n) memory generally.

Because primary constructor's arguments `self` continues to exist until ths object is garbage collected, assigning null to self is needed now if StreamIterator's API shouldn't be changed.

Thanks again.
