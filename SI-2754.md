The following code compiles without warnings or errors.
```scala
object Main {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        val v: FooBarPlus[Int] = new FooBarPlusImpl()
        v.foo += 10
    }
}

trait Foo[P] { //removing [P] and filling in Int instead of P fixes the problem
    def foo: P
}

trait FooBar[P] extends Foo[P] {
    def bar: P
}

trait FooBarPlus[P] extends FooBar[P] {
    // overrides are required to compile "v.foo += 10" in the main method
    override def foo: P //removing this override fixes the problem
    override def bar: P

    def foo_=(x: P)
    def bar_=(x: P)
}

class FooImpl extends Foo[Int] {
    def foo = 1
}

class FooBarImpl extends FooImpl with FooBar[Int] {
    protected var f = 0
    protected var b = 0

    override def foo = f //removing this override fixes the problem
    def bar = b
}

class FooBarPlusImpl extends FooBarImpl with FooBarPlus[Int] {
    def foo_=(x: Int) { f = x }
    def bar_=(x: Int) { b = x }
}
```

When trying to run the code, JVM crashes with the following error:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&signature in class file FooBarPlusImpl
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:621)
        ...
```

As noted in comments: removing some override definitions makes the code work; removing type annotations and inlining one type causes the code to work as well.

The problem was reduced to the smallest form, original classes are much larger and have many methods that cause collision. In my case as was able to find a workaround by dropping some overrides. However this may not always be the case. With some imagination it is possible to come up with a scenario when overrides are required for a purpose other than enabling += syntax.
