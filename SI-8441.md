When calling compile method on IMain (JSR223 ScriptEngine) with an invalid script, ScriptException is thrown with no other information than the message: "compile-time error". It should be thrown with an error message coming from the compiler, and also with the lineNumber and columnNumber arguments.

It should throw the same ScriptException content as when calling eval method.

It's quite inconvenient when embedding Scala in a end-user application with a JSR223 Script Editor, along with others languages (see attached screenshots). The Script Editor calls compile to validate the script from user invalid input through JSR223 API, and display message from ScriptException to the user if it fails to compile.

Others ScriptEngine implementations (Groovy, MVEL, Jython ...) provides usefull those information on compilation errors (line number, column number, compiler message).
Thanks, my fix uses a custom reporter for the position; funnily, the column is offset by the embedding template.

So after correcting column, it seems line could be the repl's internal line counter, too.
