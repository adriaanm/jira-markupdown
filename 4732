Neat-o, that's good to hear. I trust that running the program works too? One of my concerns is that I might be allowing something to compile, but to miscompile.

The code is behind a -Y option because it's pretty sketchy. Jason I know you've already looked at it, but if we want to let it out from its -Y cage it probably needs even more looks.
