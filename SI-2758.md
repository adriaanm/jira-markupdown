Using Scala version 2.8.0.r19995-b20091203110322 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).

-make:transitive does not track new source dependencies.

Given A.scala, B.scala
```scala
object A {
  val x = 3
}
object B {
  val y = 5
}
```

Compile with:
```scala
scalac -make:transitive *.scala
```

`.scala_dependencies` looks like:
```scala
A.scala -> A.scala
B.scala -> B.scala
```

Change B.scala to be
```scala
object B {
  val y = A.x
}
```

Recompile with:
```scala
scalac -make:transitive *.scala
```

`.scala_dependencies` is unchanged.  This can be confirmed by modifying A (for example, remove `'val x'`) and noting that only A.scala is recompiled.
In r21627:

Yes, it looks like that example works now.  It doesn't work if A and B are in packages, however.  For example:

A.scala
```scala
package a
object A {
  val x = 3
}
```
B.scala:
```scala
package b
object B {
  val y = 5
}
```

and after the first compilation, change B.scala to:
```scala
package b
object B {
  val y = a.A.x
}
```
