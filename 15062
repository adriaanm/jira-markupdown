Consider the following:
```scala
val bool: Boolean = false
bool match {
  case true => "true!"
}
```

Expectation:  I'd hope for a non-exhaustive match warning.
Actual result: run-time MatchError

Likewise for:
```scala
val bool: Boolean = true
bool match {
  case true => "true!"
  case false => "false!"
  case _ => "cats and dogs living together... mass hysteria!"
}
```

Expectation: I would expect to receive an unreachable code error. 
Actual: Silent, happy, deluded compiler.

Tested on 2.8.0 nightly as of Feb 26, 2010.
