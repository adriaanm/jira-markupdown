When I run scripts these days they don't exit unless I call System.exit.  I suspect it is somehow a consequence of the changes I made in r22186 to accomodate SI-2006 among others.
I noticed this as well when implementing the fix for SI-2943.  I don't use scripts so I figured I was doing something wrong.

Note that if you use -savecompiled, it only hangs when the script needs to be recompiled.  The ctrl+break dump shows threads hanging around that are related to forking a process.  It looks like there are two threads that read from the input stream of a forked process.  I assume that it is something about io.Process that is the problem and that the problem is triggered by forking fsc.

So, I think that r22186 merely exposed an issue in io.Process and r22186 is not necessarily an issue itself.
(In r22767) Since r22186 scripts wait for all non-daemon threads to exit
before the script will exit (not doing so was the cause of several
other bugs involving early script termination) but this means we
must be careful not to introduce unnecessary non-daemon threads
in the script infrastructure.  Two such sources (now fixed) were
the shutdown hook which deletes temporary files and the stream
consumers used by Process.  Closes SI-3678, review by harrah.
