Sample REPL session with -Ydependent-method-types. The following with a dependent argument type fails,

```scala
scala> trait Dep {
     |    type T                                                                                                                                                                                       
     |  }                                                                                                                                                                                              
defined trait Dep

scala> def m(d : Dep)(t : d.T) = t
m: (d: Dep)(t: d.T)d.T

scala> val f = m _
<console>:12: error: method with dependent type (d: Dep)(t: d.T)d.T cannot be converted to function value
       val f = m _
```

whereas with a type projection (ie. changing d.T to Dep#T) we succeed,

```scala
scala> def m(d : Dep)(t : Dep#T) = t
m: (d: Dep)(t: Dep#T)Dep#T

scala> val f = m _
f: Dep => Dep#T => Dep#T = <function1>
```

Having both these constructs supported equally would be highly desirable for the usability of dependent methods in Scala.

A more complete example which illustrates the usefulness of dependent function types,

```scala
implicit def m[D <: Dep](d : D)(implicit t : d.T) = t

def n[D <: Dep](d : D)(implicit f : D => d.T) = f(d)

val dep = new Dep { type T = String }
implicit val s : String = "foo"

val r : String = n(dep)
```

Here we would like m to be considered as a candidate for the implicit f in n. It isn't because eta expansion would generate a dependent function type corresponding to m.

I guess you would need to generalize `FunctionN` to something like:

```scala
scala> trait DepFunction1[-A <: AnyRef, +Return[_]] { def apply(a: A) : Return[a.type] }
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
defined trait DepFunction1

scala> trait NewFunction1[-A <: AnyRef, +R] extends DepFunction1[A, ({type l[_] = R})#l]
defined trait NewFunction1

scala> object stringId extends DepFunction1[String, ({type Id[x] = x})#Id] { def apply(s: String): s.type = s }
defined object stringId
```

Where `Return` is a type level function that accepts the singleton types of the parameters and uses these to compute the result type. Sounds pretty hairy.
Jason Zaugg, your example is almost right, but not quite.

It takes a small variant for DepFunction1 to express the type of:

```scala
def f(a: T1)(b: a.MemberT2): b.MemberT3
```
I'll parametrize over `T1` below, so `f` will be written as:
```scala
def f[T1 <: {type MemberT2 <: {type MemberT3}}](a: T1)(b: a.MemberT2): b.MemberT3 = ???
```
But I assume a concrete type with the right members would also work. I was just too bored to make things that simple :-).

The problem is that for the above case, Return cannot be defined over all types, only over subtypes of T1 with the right type member. So with your DepFunction1, I get this kind error:

```scala
scala> def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2 <: {type MemberT3}}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] = ??? 
<console>:8: error: kinds of the type arguments (T1,[x <: T1]DepFunction1[x#MemberT2,[y <: x#MemberT2]y#MemberT3]) do not conform to the expected kinds of the type parameters (type A,type Return) in trait DepFunction1.
[x <: T1]DepFunction1[x#MemberT2,[y <: x#MemberT2]y#MemberT3]'s type parameters do not match type Return's expected parameters:
type x's bounds <: T1 are stricter than type _'s declared bounds >: Nothing <: Any
       def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2 <: {type MemberT3}}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] = ??? 
                                                        ^
```
In this section, I show how to express the type of f.

```scala
//Variant: Note that Return must only accept subtypes of A
trait DepFunction1[-A <: AnyRef, +Return[_ <: A]] { def apply(a: A) : Return[a.type] }
//Your examples still work - the kind needn't match:
object stringId extends DepFunction1[String, ({type Id[x] = x})#Id] { def apply(s: String): s.type = s }
trait Function1[-A <: AnyRef, +R] extends DepFunction1[A, ({type l[_] = R})#l]
//Now we can write:
def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2 <: {type MemberT3}}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] = ???
```

That worked well! But we didn't yet eta-expand f, only represented the interface for that. There, I get an error I don't get (no pun intended):

```scala
scala> def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2 <: {type MemberT3}}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] =
     |   new DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] {
     |     def apply(a: T1) = new DepFunction1[a.MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: a.MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret] {
     |       def apply(b: a.MemberT2): b.MemberT3 = f(a)(b) //": b.MemberT3" is required, else we get more errors.
     |     }
     |   }
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : DepFunction1(in object $iw)[a.MemberT2,[y <: a.MemberT2]y#MemberT3]
 required: DepFunction1(in object $iw)[a.MemberT2,[y <: a.MemberT2]y#MemberT3]
           def apply(a: T1) = new DepFunction1[a.MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: a.MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret] {
                              ^
```
It's just a type inference bug. If you write down as return type exactly what Scalac inferred, everything works. If Scalac infers the type itself, he doesn't like what he did, although it looks the same as the expected type. Misteries of Scala programming.

Minimized:
```scala
scala> def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = x#MemberT2})#Ret] =
     |   new DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = x#MemberT2})#Ret] {
     |     def apply(a: T1) = f2(a)
     |   }
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : a.MemberT2
 required: a.MemberT2
           def apply(a: T1) = f2(a)
                                ^
```
Workarounded:
```scala
scala> def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = x#MemberT2})#Ret] =
     |   new DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = x#MemberT2})#Ret] {
     |     def apply(a: T1): a.MemberT2 = f2(a)
     |   }
g: [T1 <: AnyRef{type MemberT2}]=> DepFunction1[T1,[x <: T1]x#MemberT2]
```
Note that I just added an explicit type annotation.
Backporting this to the original code, I get working code:
```scala
scala> def g[T1 <: {type MemberT2 <: {type MemberT3}}]: DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] =
     |   new DepFunction1[T1, ({type Ret[x <: T1] = DepFunction1[x#MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: x#MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret]})#Ret] {
     |     def apply(a: T1): DepFunction1[a.MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: a.MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret] =
     |       new DepFunction1[a.MemberT2, ({type Ret[y <: a.MemberT2] = y#MemberT3})#Ret] {
     |         def apply(b: a.MemberT2): b.MemberT3 = f(a)(b)
     |       }
     |     }
g: [T1 <: AnyRef{type MemberT2 <: AnyRef{type MemberT3}}]=> DepFunction1[T1,[x <: T1]DepFunction1[x#MemberT2,[y <: x#MemberT2]y#MemberT3]]
```
Revisiting this now, it seems fairly straightforward to encode the motivating example (ie. the dependent implicit),

```scala
scala> trait Dep { type T }                                                                                              
defined trait Dep                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                         
scala> implicit def m[T0](d : Dep { type T = T0 })(implicit t : T0) = t
m: [T0](d: Dep{type T = T0})(implicit t: T0)T0                                                                           
                                                                                                                         
scala> def n[T0](d : Dep { type T = T0 })(implicit f : Dep { type T = T0} => T0) = f(d)                                  
n: [T0](d: Dep{type T = T0})(implicit f: Dep{type T = T0} => T0)T0                                                       
                                                                                                                         
scala> val dep = new Dep { type T = String }                                                                             
dep: Dep{type T = String} = $anon$1@4b6393b3                                                                             
                                                                                                                         
scala> implicit val s : String = "foo"                                                                                   
s: String = foo                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                         
scala> val r = n(dep)                                                                                                    
r: String = foo
```

This is simply trading the dependent type `d.T` for a refinement `Dep` { `type T = T0` } and a use of the constraining type `T0`.

I am seeing this again and again in 2.10.3. I'm hoping that the fix to "substitution broken for dependent types", #7753, might help there.
Another request from #8515

The function literal is inferred to existential type
C => $anon forSome { type $anon <: c.T; val c: C }
, which looks complex, but it is no more special than simple C => C#T.
Could you infer the function literal to
(C => C#T) with { def apply(c: C): c.T }
```
This part seems #7051 in action again:
```scala
scala> val t2: c.T = ({c: C => new c.T {} })(c)

 found   : $anon where type $anon <: c.T
