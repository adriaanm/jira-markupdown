An Illegal inheritance error is thrown by the compiler trying to inherit java classes/ interfaces in the following way:

{code:title=Java|borderStyle=solid}

interface A<T>{}

interface B<T> extends A<T>{}

interface C extends A{}

class D implements B,C {
	public D(){};
}
```scala

Trying to subclass D in scala:

{code:title=Scala|borderStyle=solid}

scala> class Foo extends D
<console>:7: error: illegal inheritance;
 class Foo inherits different type instances of trait A:
A[T] and A[T]
       class Foo extends D
             ^
```

The problem appeared when trying to subclass org.apache.commons.buffer.PriorityBuffer, so there are real life situations where this leads to scala<->java interop problems.

This looks at least related to #3634, which involves raw types. I'm pretty sure though, that there are also other duplicates about this ...

The source code in the source jar defines:

```scala
public class PriorityBuffer extends AbstractCollection implements Buffer, Serializable { ... }
```

So basically:

 - this involves raw types, which are not supported in Scala
 - Sun/Oracle reserves the right to remove support of raw types from javac in the future

 => this will most probably be a WON'T FIX
 => it is Apache's duty to fix it (but considering that the last release was 2008, I consider the library to be not maintained)

@Daniel: Your best chance is to file a bug in Apache's bug tracker for it.
