The following code fails to produce a non-exhaustive pattern warning when compiled with Scala 2.9.0-RC3 and above. The warning does get emitted with versions 2.9.0-RC2 and 2.8.1.

{code:scala}
sealed trait Node

class NodeType1 (val a:Int) extends Node
class NodeType2 (val b:Int) extends Node

object NodeType1 {
  def unapply (x : NodeType1) : Some[Int] = Some(x.a)
}

object NodeType2 {
  def unapply (x : NodeType2) : Some[Int] = Some(x.b)
}

object Test {
  def test (x: Node) = x match {
    case NodeType1(a) => "got node type 1 " + a 
  }
}
{code}
I stumbled across this, too (in Scala 2.9.1). Sealed traits are very important because you they can, as opposed to an abstract class, participate in multiple sealed hierarchies.

{code}
object Order {
   sealed trait EntryOption
   case object EmptyEntry extends EntryOption
   trait Entry extends EntryOption
   
   // this doesn't emit a warning:
   def isEmpty( a: EntryOption ) : Boolean = a match {
      case EmptyEntry => true
//    case _: Entry   => false
   }
}
{code}
Another example:

{code}
trait Order {
   sealed trait EntryOption
   case object EmptyEntry extends EntryOption
   sealed trait Entry extends EntryOption
   private final class EntryImpl extends Entry
       
   def isEmpty( a: EntryOption ) : Boolean = a match {
      case EmptyEntry => true
//    case _: Entry   => false
   }
}
{code}

This code above _does_ emit the warning. But the following variation not:

{code}
trait Order {
   sealed trait EntryOption
   case object EmptyEntry extends EntryOption
   sealed trait Entry extends EntryOption
       
   def isEmpty( a: EntryOption ) : Boolean = a match {
      case EmptyEntry => true
//    case _: Entry   => false
   }
}

trait OrderImpl extends Order {
   private final class EntryImpl extends Entry
}
{code}


@Arseniy:

I think you misunderstood what Adriaan said. You said that user-defined extractors are total, but Scala does not and cannot check that (for the general case anyway -- it's theoretically possible to detect trivial cases). Since it can never decide whether a pattern with user-defined extractors is exhaustive or not, it simply turns that feature off, therefore not warning in cases where it could make a statement to the effect that the matching is definitely not exhaustive.

Anyway, given that the pattern matcher cannot warn non-exhaustiveness correctly, it doing so in some cases might lead people to think that absence of a warning as an assertion of exhaustiveness (which it is not).

I agree with Arseniy, and "we can't warn about everything so we will warn about nothing" is a completely bogus line of argumentation which nobody believes with any consistency, or we'd have no warnings.

There is no reason f2 and f3 in the following can't give the same warning which f1 does.  We have exactly the same information about what is covered and what is not in each of them.  It would be very useful if this worked.
{code}
sealed trait Foo
class Bar1 extends Foo
class Bar2 extends Foo
class Bar3 extends Foo

object Baz1 {
  def unapply(x: Bar1): Some[Int] = Some(1)
}
object Baz2 {
  def unapply(x: Bar2): Some[Int] = Some(2)
}


object Test {
  def f1(x: Foo) = x match {
    case _: Bar1 => 1
    case _: Bar2 => 2
  }
  def f2(x: Foo) = x match {
    case _: Bar1 => 1
    case Baz2(x) => x
  }
  def f3(x: Foo) = x match {
    case Baz1(x) => x
    case Baz2(x) => x
  }
}
{code}

They can return Math.random if they want.  An extractor covers Bar1 because the method parameter type is Bar1 and the return is Some[T].  The values are immaterial. We can hope against Math.random on general principles though if you like.
