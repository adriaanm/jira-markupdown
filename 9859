I think the original intention for adding this check was scala/bug#473. However, I don't think the original fix for the VerifyError is the right one and with later additions it didn't get better.

The original failing code was this:
```scala
class Foo(x: Foo)
object Voop extends Foo(Voop)
```

is not required to end up in a VerifyError:

Here's a somewhat equivalent Java version which compiles but which shows "Called with null" when run, the expected and hard to avoid initialization problem:
```scala
class Foo {
  Foo(Foo outer) {
    System.out.println("Called with "+outer);
  }
}

class Voop extends Foo {
  static final Voop theInstance;
  static {
    theInstance = new Voop();
  }
  String i = "test";

  Voop() {
    super(Voop.theInstance);
  }
}

public class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(Voop.theInstance);
  }
}
```

IMO, the original fix should have been targeted at avoiding the `VerifyError` and nothing else. 

Then, there still remains the initialization problem which you can also get now by circumventing the check with a simple added indirection:
```scala
class Foo(f: Foo) {
  println(f)
}

object Redirector {
  def voop = Voop
}

object Voop extends Foo(Redirector.voop)

object Test extends App {
  Voop
}
```

Catching those initialization errors then seems to be similar to catching all the other initialization problems (and similarly hard).
