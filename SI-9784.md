When the f-interpolator winds up just concatenating strings, it should just use StringBuilder instead of String.format. This makes a big difference on scala-js.

These should be equivalent:
```scala
f"My name is $name"
"My name is " + name
```
Or even better: just plain old String.+, and let the back-end decide what's the best strategy to compile string concatenation. Spoiler: on JS that's **not** using StringBuilder, it's using JS' own string concatenation.
