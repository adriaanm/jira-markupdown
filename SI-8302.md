scalatest has a problem with high memory consumption again:
https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/pull/235#issuecomment-35303871

It requires about 2GB to compile its tests. I was digging into it a little bit by capturing memory snapshot at the end of typer. Yourkit suggests that we are leaking memory through {{undoLog}}. Specifically, it shows two things:

1. UndoLog is a class at the top of the list of classes with the highest memory retention (right after Global, ::,  etc.)
2. Object with biggest distance from GC root is {{TypeConstraint}} and its distance from GC root is 3 897 019. That is through series of {{::}} objects that contain {{Tuple2}}.

I can't imagine that we would go almost 4m deep in undoLog stack for any single compilation unit so it seems like we are leaking memory somehow.

@grzeg: i think that you miscounted the size of Scalacheck tests:

No. I compiled those scalatest tests with `-Ydebug -Ylog:all` and grepped for `undolog`. That turns on logging in the `clear()` method those shows the length of the log when it is cleared. That is done after each compilation unit. 

It never shows more than 17k entries.

So its a bit of a mystery how you saw such a long path the GC root. Did it pass through `undoLog` itself? 

Looking around through comments, it seems we are really confused as to when we can clear the log. It is cleared eagerly when we actually have something to undo (when a type relation <:< or =:= returns false). But otherwise, the comments tell us:

{code}
} finally {
    subsametypeRecursions -= 1
    // XXX AM TODO: figure out when it is safe and needed to clear the log -- the commented approach below is too eager (it breaks #3281, #3866)
    // it doesn't help to keep separate recursion counts for the three methods that now share it
    // if (subsametypeRecursions == 0) undoLog.clear()
  }
{code}

To me, the natural place to clear the log is when we finish a type inference session. But I reckon any such attempt *might* run into the same underlying problem as SI-7782 / bce786f070afe383d203c4d809ef69803330b340, which is that we've got a single undolog per global, which is shared by interleaved typechecking that happens with source-completers. It might be interesting to see if you could move undolog to `Context`. That's were we store another, similar sort of undo-log:

{code}
  class Context {
    ...
    /** Saved type bounds for type parameters which are narrowed in a GADT. */
    var savedTypeBounds: List[(Symbol, Type)] = List()
{code}
I just selected {{log}} field of UndoLog and asked yourkit to show me all objects retained by it. I get:
_(I tried to include the image inline but JIRA is hopeless, it doesn't respect DPI information in PNG file :-/)_
https://issues.scala-lang.org/secure/attachment/15810/yourkit-undolog-retained.png

I think this does suggest we leak memory. I know that this is a transitive closure, so maybe it's not undolog that retain that object directly but indirectly through some TypeRefs. I find this to be very unlikely especially if you look at how many Tuple2 are being retained. Maybe we blow up within single compilation run when there no clearing of undolog performed? I took memory snapshot in the middle of type checking.
I took another look for this problem but was unable to reproduce retention of undolog entries at the completion of the compiler. Perhaps I was measuring something different from "capturing memory snapshot at the end of typer"; [~grek] what mechanism did you use to control when the snapshot was taken?

Limiting SBT to one compilation at a time helps to reduce overall memory requirements and make the results of profiling easier to digest:

{code}
sbt> set concurrentRestrictions in Global := Seq(Tags.limit(Tags.CPU, 1))
{code}
