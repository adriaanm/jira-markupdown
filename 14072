There is something wrong with the equals or with the XML processing stuff. Look at this:
```scala
scala> <a></a>
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <a></a>

scala> <a>{xml.NodeSeq.Empty}</a>
res1: scala.xml.Elem = <a></a>

scala> <a>{""}</a>
res2: scala.xml.Elem = <a></a>

scala> <a>{if (true) "" else "noo"}</a>
res3: scala.xml.Elem = <a></a>

scala> res0 == res1
res4: Boolean = true

scala> res0 == res2
res5: Boolean = true

scala> res0 == res3
res6: Boolean = false
```
I would expect that res0, res1, res2, res3 are all the same. So the result for each comparison should be true. But in the last case scala says false...
