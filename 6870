We could also enable a syntax like this:
```scala
object (O: Int => Int) extends (Int => Int) { def apply(x: Int): Int = x }
```
This is not the only place where this is important.  It's increasingly problematic that there is no way to place a type ascription on an object to weaken its type.  It makes them useless in some situations and dangerous in others.
