scala lib version: 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT (timestamp: 20091006.003811 buildNumber: 232)

I can't pass the class of an object to a (Java) annotation (for ex, this one: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/directory/apacheds/trunk/core-integ/src/main/java/org/apache/directory/server/core/integ/annotations/Factory.java )

The Factory annotation expects a Factory implementation, which is just class with a static method "newInstance", and so is done in Scala with an object.

In Java, I write: @Factory( MyFactory.class )

In scala, @Factory( classOf[MyFactory] ) won't work as MyFactory is an object and @Factory( MyFactory.getClass ) doesn't compile due to the error:

"annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: MyFactory.getClass"

I don't see any other way to pass the object's class as the annotation parameter.
I have a similar problem:

Using the Oracle Berkeley DB for Java, I get:

"annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: ONE_TO_ONE{<null>}"

when using this annotation:

@SecondaryKey(relate = ONE_TO_ONE)

where "ONE_TO_ONE" was imported as:
import com.sleepycat.persist.model.Relationship.ONE_TO_ONE

Interestingly, this problem shows up **only** in the Eclipse plugin manifesting as the error icon against the line in the editor, but **not** under the problems views.  It also does not generate an error from a command-line scalac compilation.

This is using the 2.8 nightly from 20091021.
Hi Fanf,

the question is which `Class` object should be passed to the annotation. For top-level scala objects, the scala compiler generates two classfiles

```scala
  object o { def x = 1 }
```

you get
 * o.class, which has static methods forwarding to the methods of o$$, i.e.
```scala
  class o { static int x() { return o$$.MODULE$$.x(); } }
```
 * o$$.class, which contains the actual implementation of the object's methods. The static initializer creates an instance of o$$ and stores it in the MODULE$$ field
```scala
  class o$$ {
    o$$ MODULE$$ = new o$$;
    int x() { return 1; }
  }
```

I don't know what `org.apache.directory.server.core.integ.annotations.Factory` expects. If it wants static factory methods, we should pass the `o` class, not `o$$`.

However, calling `o.getClass` in scala returns
```scala
scala> o.getClass
res0: java.lang.Class[_] = class o$$
```

----

For nested objects, the additional classfile with static forwarders is **not** generated. Instead, a method is added to the containing class:

```scala
  class A { object p { def x = 1 } }
```

generates

 * A.class with
```scala
  class A {
    A$$p$$ p$$module = null;
    A$$p$$ p() {
      if (p$$module == null) { p$$module = new A$$p$$ };
      return A$$p$$;
    }
  }
```
 * A$$p$$.class with
```scala
  class A$$p$$ { int x() { return 1; } }
```


So in this case there doesn't exist any static methods which could be called.


Again, `getClass` returns the object `A$$p$$`:

```scala
scala> (new A).p.getClass
res0: java.lang.Class[_] = class A$$p$$
```


----

We cannot allow `o.getClass` to be a constant because it isn't. Maybe we could hack something because we know that objects are final.

I could allow `classOf[o.type]` and load the module class in this case (`o$$`), but I don't know if this helps in your case. I cannot load the class with the static forwarders (`o`) because this is only generated in the backend, and only for top-level objects.

```scala
scala> object O
defined module O

scala> def impl[T: c.WeakTypeTag](c: Context): c.Expr[Class[_]] = {import c.universe._; c.Expr[Class[_]](Literal(Constant(weakTypeOf[T])))}
impl: [T](c: scala.reflect.macros.Context)(implicit evidence$1: c.WeakTypeTag[T])c.Expr[Class[_]]

scala> def moduleClassOf[T <: Singleton]: Class[_] = macro impl[T]
moduleClassOf: [T <: Singleton]=> Class[_]

scala> moduleClassOf[O.type]
res5: Class[O.type] = class O$
```
I think this ticket demonstrates an issue, but we should think into which direction it should take us and adapt the ticket accordingly.

Should we come up with a way to refer to a companion symbol type as a constant (like `companionOf\[T\]`) or look into making `SomeObject.getClass` work as a constant literal?
