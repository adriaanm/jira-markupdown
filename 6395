Ultimately it's related to that fact that the static type affects the behavior of map
```scala
scala> import scala.collection.mutable.{LinkedHashSet, Set}
import scala.collection.mutable.{LinkedHashSet, Set}

scala> val s1 = LinkedHashSet("one", "two", "zebra", "12345")
s1: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashSet[String] = Set(one, two, zebra, 12345)

scala> s1 map identity
res9: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashSet[String] = Set(one, two, zebra, 12345)

scala> (s1 : Set[String]) map identity
res10: scala.collection.mutable.Set[String] = Set(zebra, 12345, two, one)
```

Which means in order to fix this we would need a distinct static type when j.u.LinkedHashSet is converted. That kind of addition to the library wouldn't be forward compatible so per 2.10 policies I have to kick this down the road.
