You'd need to propose another spec for eta-expansion then. The compiler is faithful to the spec in 6.25.5. Note that mandating that cbn parameters themselves are lifted out with def instead of val is not enough. You'd still need to figure out how to do something like
```scala
val t = test(identity(println("never seen")))_
```
Reassigning to you, because I don't know a better solution.
