implicit val immediateContext = new scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext {
    override def execute(runnable: Runnable) { runnable.run() }
    override def reportFailure(t: Throwable) { t.printStackTrace() }
  }

This is not a valid execution context. We will update the documentation to explain that ECs must be async to be general purposeâ€”i.e. you can only use the construct above to execute *your own* code.
