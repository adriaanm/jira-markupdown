The type inference engine is unable to infer, that the variable {{t}} bound inside of the multiple pattern match is of type {{T}}:

{code}
scala> trait T; class A extends T; class B extends T
defined trait T
defined class A
defined class B

scala> def f(t: T): T = t match { case t @ (_: A | _: B) => t }
f: (t: T)T

scala> def f(t: Any): T = t match { case t @ (_: A | _: B) => t }
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Any
 required: T
       def f(t: Any): T = t match { case t @ (_: A | _: B) => t }
                                                              ^
{code}
This is tied up somewhat with SI-1503. It's not that it can't infer that it's a T, it's that it won't, because it is unsound to infer anything about types from value equality and it is tarring all bindings with the same brush. It could be instructed that binding to the result of a type test won't hurt it.
