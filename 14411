The Iterator returned by ListBuffer.elements (ListBuffer.iterator in SVN) defines a hasNext method that results in a call to .equals() on the elements.  In the best case this is a performance issue, but it can also cause incorrect behavior if the .equals() implementation throws an exception.

Perhaps the test (cursor != last0) was intended to be !(cursor eq last0).

To replicate:
```scala
class C { override def equals(rhs: Any) = throw new Error }
val buf = new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[C]         
buf += new C
buf += new C
for (elem <- buf) {}
```

An exception will be thrown.  This bug is present in the stable release and in the most recent code checked into subversion.
