Hi, as per discussion in the mailing list with Martin, I'm adding a request to add a .force method (or similar) to the Collections hierarchy. For strict/eager collections, it would be a noop, returning this. For lazy collections, it would automatically create a new eager collection of the appropriate type. (A Map.Projection would return a Map.)

If preferred, I can submit a patch, but it will be some days before I can get to it.

Thanks!
