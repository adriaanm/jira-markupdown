Scala 2.7.2 final produces invalid parsing errors when loading a file into an interactive shell. This happens when either an object or a class definition has a newline between the `id` and the `TemplateBody`'s opening curly brace.

Let's say we have the following code in a file called `Foo.scala`:
{code}
object Foo
{
    def bar = 0
}
{code}

When we load `Foo.scala` by running `scala -i Foo.scala`, the parsing fails, causing an error:
{code}
<console>:3: error: block must end in result expression, not in definition
{code}

After removing one newline character, the following code works:
{code}
object Foo {
    def bar = 0
}
{code}
But when running either version directly with the scala interpreter - as in `scala Foo.scala` - they both work.
