I just bumped into what seems to be SI-6541 on Scala 2.11.7:

{noformat}
SI-6541$ cat build.sbt 
scalaVersion := "2.11.7"

scalacOptions ++= Seq("-Xfatal-warnings",
                      "-feature")
{noformat}

{noformat}
SI-6541$ cat src/main/scala/Test.scala 
trait A[T] {}
case class B(a: A[_])
{noformat}

{noformat}
SI-6541$ sbt compile

In 2.11.x you need to pass {{-Xsource:2.12}}, see https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4017. Can you please try that? If it doesn't work, feel free to re-open this ticket.
