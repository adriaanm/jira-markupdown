Calling toSeq on both, immutable.Map and immutable.Set returns a mutable.ArrayBuffer. Within the collection.immutable namespace only explicit conversions to mutable types should return mutable data structures.

```scala
    scala> Map().toSeq
    res0: Seq[(Nothing, Nothing)] = ArrayBuffer()

    scala> Set().toSeq
    res1: Seq[Nothing] = ArrayBuffer()
```
The big concern here, of course, is performance.  `ArrayBuffer` has very little extra work to do to create itself, and it doesn't have much overhead.  (Of course it also matters what you're going to do with the resulting collection.)  `List` can be a little faster if you build it in place (not with a builder) by iterating in reverse order, but that causes `O(n)` object creations.  `Vector` is slower by about 3 ns (unless empty): unsurprising since you have to create a builder as well (more garbage).  And this is significant for a map of size 1--it doubles the creation time!  Perhaps small sizes can be special-cased?

Anyway, this is a change that warrants a bit of care before making.  The common supertype of mutable and immutable has an API that does not admit mutation, so it's not that dangerous to use it; the downside is mostly that you won't get structural sharing like you do with `List` (and sometimes with `Vector`).
Ha, but of course the actual answer is that `toSeq` is asymptotically 2x slower than it needs to be (and up to 5x on small sizes?!?!) because of too much code reuse and the wrong choice of whether the map should iterate itself (yes!) or the buffer should with `++=` (no!--the map knows how to do it fastest, and buffer `+=` is supposed to be fast).

So we can fix this to use e.g. `Vector` and still come out ahead on the first conversion.  Whether it works as well thereafter will depend on what's being done to the `Seq`.  In most cases we could be a faster yet with `WrappedArray`, but maybe structural sharing in e.g. `Vector` will be worth it?
Can get a 200x speedup on `toSeq` for empty collections (!!!).  Asymptotic behavior is the same as `toVector` which was about 1.5x faster than `toSeq` was.

I guess a little code duplication goes a long way.
