For the record it looks like this fixes a problem building the continuations plugin with 2.8.0.Beta1-RC7 (soon to be an official beta). With that version I get:

{code}
   [scalac] doc/examples/continuations/JoinPatterns.scala:103: warning: Could not inline required method -> because it is not final.
   [scalac]                 items += (c.asInstanceOf[Channel[_,_]] -> MatchData(c.values(0)))
   [scalac]                                                            ^
   [scalac] doc/examples/continuations/Test9Monads.scala:42: warning: Could not inline required method -> because it is not final.
   [scalac]       List(left.reflect[Any] -> right.reflect[Any])
   [scalac]                              ^
{code}

With 2.8.0.r20558-b20100118020155 these warnings are gone.
