If a method has a return type other than "Nothing" but throws an exception, the exception-throwing statement is marked with the warning: "dead code following this construct"

{code}
object Bug1 {
  def foo1 : Any = throw new RuntimeException     // Warning
  def foo2 : Unit = throw new RuntimeException    // Warning
  def foo3 : Nothing = throw new RuntimeException // No warning
}
{code}

This happens with encapsulated throws like in "error", too.

{code}
object Bug2 {
  def foo4 : Any = error("")     // Warning
  def foo5 : Unit = error("")    // Warning
  def foo6 : Nothing = error("") //No warning
}
{code}

I use "Scala Eclipse Plugin 2.8.0.r20879-b20100214035850".

This happens even if i disable the "Ydead-code" option in the Scala preference page. But perhaps the preference page isn't working correctly and "Ydead-code" is still active...don't know.

I guess this is not high-priority. Just a wrong warning, after all.
