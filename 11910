I already encountered similar problems in the past but I don't think it is a bug. I guess it happens because of type erasure which prevents to do the necessary check at the moment of the casting. If you take your example, the following produces the error:
```scala
Seq((1,1)).asInstanceOf[Seq[(String,String)]].map { x => (x._1,x._2) }.head._1
```

but if you just get the head, it still works:
```scala
Seq((1,1)).asInstanceOf[Seq[(String,String)]].map { x => (x._1,x._2) }.head
```
