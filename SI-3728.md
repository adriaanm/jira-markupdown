Methods like
```scala
def test[T](a: Array[T])
```

in Scala are compiled to a Java method with signature

```scala
Signature: (Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/runtime/Null$$;
```

So they use `Object` as parameter type because primitive valued and reference valued arrays share no common supertype.

The generated generic Java signature, however, is
```scala
<T:Ljava/lang/Object;>([TT;)Lscala/runtime/Null$$;;
```

javac uses the the erasure of the generic signature when it references a method, so you get treated by a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` at runtime if you call such a method from Java code.

Since Java cannot handle primitive and reference arrays generically, the best would be to completely omit the generic signatures in these cases.
