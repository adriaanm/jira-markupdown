I can't for the life of me understand where/how these messages are getting made like that, but there are many tests that rely on this formatting.

In t6040.check, for example, you'll find:

{noformat}
error: extension of type scala.Dynamic needs to be enabled
by making the implicit value language.dynamics visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import language.dynamics'
or by setting the compiler option -language:dynamics.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.dynamics for a discussion
why the feature needs to be explicitly enabled.
one error found
{noformat}

Line breaks in messages mess with many build systems and generally it doesn't seem like a presentation-level detail like terminal width should have much bearing on compiler output.
> Anyway, I'm just going to import the features

Apparently, the message worked.

But it would be nice to have a mechanism for turning on verboser messages.

The converse of -Xdev, but without calling it -noob.  Sometimes you just want scalac to tell you everything it knows (and that might help).  Maybe -explain, by analogy to -explaintypes.

Or scala.language.feature.explanations. Then you get some fine control over where it is applied.  And you wouldn't have to go on scala-user for Jason to tell you to use -Xlog-implicits.

-Xlint could go bonkers when explanations are enabled.

A new error type could be emitted:

error: code this bad needs to be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.explanations visible.
Then I'll tell you everything you just did wrong.



I just checked the mirror and, as forewarned above, my face is ugly and full of line breaks.

I still think there should be an `-Xnoob` mode or `-Xlint:noob` in which the warning message devolves into a ranting tirade.
