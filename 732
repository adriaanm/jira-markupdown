I am afraid that's the expected behavior. It's already implied by the spec:

An early definition is type-checked and evaluated in the scope which
is in effect just before the template being defined, augmented by any
type parameters of the enclosing class and by any early definitions
preceding the one being defined. In particular, any reference to
\lstinline@this@ in the right-hand side of an early definition refers
to the identity of \lstinline@this@ just outside the template. Consequently, it
is impossible that an early definition refers to the object being
constructed by the template, or refers to one of its fields and
methods, except for any other preceding early definition in the same
section.

I have now added two more sentences, just to make it clear:

Furthermore, references to preceding early definitions
always refer to the value that's defined there, and do not take into account
overriding definitions. In other words, a block of early definitions
is evaluated exactly as if it was a local bock containing a number of value
definitions.
