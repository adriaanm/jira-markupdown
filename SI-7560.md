The discussion at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2620
uncovered that the ICode-based optimizer's DCE doesn't eliminate a redundant conditional jump,
where both branches lead to one and the same instruction.

The example showing the above is {{test/files/jvm/bytecode-test-example/Foo_1.scala}} reproduced below:

{noformat}
class Foo_1 {
  def foo(x: AnyRef): Int = {
    val bool = x == null
    if (x != null)
      1
    else
      0
  }
}
{noformat}

With GenASM and {{-optimise}} we get the two conditional jumps that {{bytecode-test-example.check}} expects:

{noformat}
  public foo(Ljava/lang/Object;)I
   L0
    ALOAD 1
    IFNONNULL L1
   L1
    ALOAD 1
    IFNONNULL L2
   L3
    ICONST_0
    GOTO L4
   L2
    ICONST_1
   L4
    IRETURN
   L5
    LOCALVARIABLE this LFoo_1; L0 L5 0
    LOCALVARIABLE x Ljava/lang/Object; L0 L5 1
    MAXSTACK = 1
    MAXLOCALS = 2
{noformat}

including a useless

{noformat}
    ALOAD 1
    IFNONNULL L1
   L1
{noformat}

(useless because, whether the conditional jump is taken or not, {{L1}} is the target anyway)

If you need help fixing this bug, take a look at how the new optimizer ( http://magarciaepfl.github.io/scala/ ) does it, in particular:

https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/44abfdb886363a19126a68f5f0b24037a73569db/src/asm/scala/tools/asm/optimiz/JumpReducer.java

Quoting from its documentation:

{noformat}
/**
 *  Simplifies branches that need not be taken to get to their destination:
 *    (1) conditional jump followed by unconditional jump, both to the same destination.
 *    (2) (conditional or unconditional) jump to a destination that is the next program point anyway.
 *  Details in `branchOverGoto()` and in `jumpToNext()`
