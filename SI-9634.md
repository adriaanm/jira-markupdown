As expressed in [SO 33650809](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33650809/optionlong-constructor-throws-a-nullpointerexception), the creation of `Option` from a null-carrying `java.lang` value can cause a `NullPointerException` to be thrown.

This is because the way `Option` factory is defined:

```scala
def apply[A](x: A): Option[A] = if (x == null) None else Some(x)
```

What happens is that the `x` (being e.g. `java.lang.Long` - and carrying a null) is first implicitly converted to `scala.Long`, before being compared to null. `scala.Long` is an `AnyVal` and cannot thus carry a null. Thus the exception.

I would see two ways to fix this unexpected behaviour, as explained in my proto pull request.

The approach I would like to see in future Scala versions is a guarantee that an `Option` will never carry a `java.lang` value, but the corresponding Scala `AnyVal`. I.e. one could not create an `Option[java.lang.Long]`, at all. This makes sense since the use of `Option` is often used at Java/Scala borders, to filter out `null`s. If the value is not null, we can just as well represent it as a Scala `AnyVal`. This change would only make the guarantee of `Option` stronger.

Also, the way an IDE can obscure the difference between `scala.Long` and `java.lang.Long` from the user (showing both as simply `Long`), this would help managing conversions in general. Creating an `Option` from a `java.lang.Long` would create an `Option[scala.Long]`, which is what APIs likely would be expecting. Without this change, one gets weird error messages such as "expecting `Option[Long]` but had `Option[Long]`".

The other way to solve the NullPointerException problem would be to use two type parameters to `Option`, allowing the test against `null` to precede the implicit conversion. This, however, would break code that explicitly provides one (target) template argument for `Option`. It would also allow `Option[java.lang.Long]` to be created, leading to the above compilation issues.
I don't think this is worth doing just for Option.apply, while leaving the rest of the language and standard library unchanged. It wouldn't be consistent with how Scala handles boxed vs. unboxed types in any other situation, and it would change the meaning of existing code. (Plus it would involve adding overloads on Option.apply, which currently has none, which is desirable; overloading is something of a last resort.)

And as for the possibility of carrying this thinking through to the rest of the language and standard library, I think that's a non-starter. The design of how Scala treats boxed Java types was settled at least a decade ago and the benefit would have to be very high indeed in order to justify the cost of pushing through such a fundamental change.

The only change in this vein I can envision perhaps being accepted would be adding an additional method, not named `apply`, that is overloaded as you propose. `Option.unbox`, I guess, by analogy with existing methods like `Long.unbox` (which translate nulls to 0). I dunno, though, `Option\(x\).map(_.longValue)` or `Option\(x\).map(Long.unbox)` seem not so bad to me. And I have not seen a need for this come up very often on SO, IRC, conversations with colleagues, etc.
This is for fans:
```scala
scala> implicit class xxx(val o: Option.type) extends AnyVal {
     | def longmire(v: java.lang.Long): Option[Long] =
     |   o(v) map (Long.unbox) }

```
I agree with Seth, it looks to me like too much of a special case to be added to scala.Option. After all you need to provide the type parameter `Option[Long]` explicitly to trigger the NPE. This is consistent with existing behavior:

```scala
scala> (null: java.lang.Long): Long
java.lang.NullPointerException
  at scala.Predef$.Long2long(Predef.scala:368)
  ... 28 elided
```
