Miles Sabin stumbled upon an [interesting corner case](https://gist.github.com/milessabin/4973733) in how `lazy val` definitions interact with pattern matching.  The basic idea:

```scala
scala> val stream = Stream.iterate(0, 3) { x => println(x); x + 1 }
stream: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(0, ?)

scala> lazy val Stream(a, b, c) = stream
a: Int = <lazy>
b: Int = <lazy>
c: Int = <lazy>

scala> a
0
1
res0: Int = 0
```

One would hope that only `a` is forced, but all three values are. This is because of how the val definition is expanded:

```scala
lazy val $fresh = stream match {
  case Stream(a, b, c) => (a, b, c)
}
lazy val a = $fresh._1
lazy val b = $fresh._2
lazy val c = $fresh._3
```

The culprit is construction of a tuple in the synthesized `case` clause: tuples are strict, so forcing `a` forces the whole tuple.

If the language spec instead required an expansion similar to:

```scala
lazy val a = stream match { case Stream(a, _, _) => a }
lazy val b = stream match { case Stream(_, b, _) => b }
lazy val c = stream match { case Stream(_, _, c) => c }
```

Or if the library had `LazyTuple` types:

```scala
lazy val $fresh = stream match {
  case Stream(a, b, c) => LazyTuple3(a, b, c)
}
lazy val a = $fresh._1
lazy val b = $fresh._2
lazy val c = $fresh._3
```

... then the laziness would be appropriately deferred to `Stream`.

That being said, I don't actually know how one would write an appropriate `Stream.unapplySeq`, or `unapply` for any data type in general, that doesn't force all value members. Seems like a separate `unapplyLazy`, returning an `Option\[LazyTuple\]`, would be necessary... and that's horrible.
