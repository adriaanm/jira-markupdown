Changing this would cause weaker types to be inferred for case bodies, which would cause weaker types for matches, which would cause weaker types for expressions, which would cause weaker types for methods. This in turn would impact everything: implicit resolution, overloading selection, overrides, conformance, on and on. All of that happens regardless of whether the potentially unsound case body is ever reached at runtime. It could be the world's least sound case body, but if the pattern never matches then it is a tree falling in a forest where everyone has lost their ears to the plague and doesn't care about trees. At least, it is until we make it not compile anymore.

None of that means we shouldn't fix it, and I don't have any reason to believe it's going to hit that many places in the wild, I'm just answering the question.

If you're thinking on this matter, this would be a great time to look at the ticket I was bugging you about a month ago, scala/bug#785. And at my implementation of much of what's in it, https://github.com/paulp/scala/commit/4bd8ad6ae5 .
