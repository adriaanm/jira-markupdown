Assuming there is no `ne` package, the following top-level import:

```scala
import ne.foobar
```

makes the compiler complain that:

```
error: missing arguments for method ne in class Object;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
       import ne.foo
              ^
```

I believe this is misleading for the Plain Old User.
