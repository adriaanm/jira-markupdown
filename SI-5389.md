Assuming there is no {{ne}} package, the following top-level import:

{code}
import ne.foobar
{code}

makes the compiler complain that:

{noformat}
error: missing arguments for method ne in class Object;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
       import ne.foo
              ^
{noformat}

I believe this is misleading for the Plain Old User.
