This is a very minor warning, and does not seem to affect anything adversely.  But importing Traversable in Tuple2 and Tuple3 when it is already visible in package.scala causes the warning:

[scalacfork] c:\dev\scala\scala\src\library\scala\Tuple2.scala:15: warning: imported `Traversable' is permanently hidden by definition of value Traversable in package scala
[scalacfork] import scala.collection.{TraversableLike, Traversable, IterableLike}
[scalacfork]        ^
[scalacfork] c:\dev\scala\scala\src\library\scala\Tuple3.scala:15: warning: imported `Traversable' is permanently hidden by definition of value Traversable in package scala
[scalacfork] import scala.collection.{TraversableLike, Traversable, IterableLike}

Simply removing Traversable from the imports takes care of this.  Diff attached. (as if anyone would need it)  ^^
