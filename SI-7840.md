The following shouldn't compile:

{code}
scala> ().asInstanceOf[Int]
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.runtime.BoxedUnit cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer
  at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(BoxesRunTime.java:105)
  ... 32 elided
 
scala> println(().asInstanceOf[Int])
()
{code}

It is clear that it can't work in the first case because Unit can't be cast to Int. The second case is even more misleading because the cast is optimized away. A compilation error should be the best possible thing in both cases.
Every time you insert a cast by calling {{asInstanceOf}} you escape any static or runtime guarantees about your types. Therefore, what you report is not a bug.

Yes but {{asInstanceOf}} doesn't check whether your cast makes sense or not because in general case it's not possible to check. Casting is always unsafe and asking for any assistance with casting is not very fruitful endeavor.
Casts can succeed in cases when there is no subtype relationship.

{code}
scala> ().asInstanceOf[scala.runtime.BoxedUnit]
res1: scala.runtime.BoxedUnit = ()

scala> () : scala.runtime.BoxedUnit
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: scala.runtime.BoxedUnit
              () : scala.runtime.BoxedUnit
              ^

scala> class Box[A](var a: A)
defined class Box

scala> (new Box("")).asInstanceOf[Box[Int]].asInstanceOf[Box[String]].a.reverse
res3: String = ""
{code}
