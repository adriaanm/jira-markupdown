if you try to run a scala object via the Run As -> Scala Application
menu the eclipse plugin fails to use the correct package name when the
source path is a multiple level directory such as src/main/scala
(maven 2 style layout)

when running the menu item on the class test.Hello the following
exception occurs in the console:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
src/main/scala/test/Hello



steps to reproduce:


 1. create new scala project
 2. remove default src/ build path
 3. mkdir src/main/scala
 4. add src/main/scala build path
 5. create new scala application (src/main/scala/test/Hello.scala)
 6. on the new object: run as -> scala application

expected result:

plugin should know classname is test.Hello when using deep source path
and run it in the console
