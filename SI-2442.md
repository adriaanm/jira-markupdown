Java enums are effectively sealed, but are not treated as such by Scala match statements. Example:

```scala
// MyEnum.java
public enum MyEnum {
  ONE, TWO, THREE;
}
```

```scala
//
import MyEnum._

object EnumTest {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    f(ONE)
    f(TWO)
    f(THREE)
  }

  def f(e: MyEnum) = e match {
    case ONE => println("one")
    case TWO => println("two")
  }
}
```

This will compile correctly, but at runtime will fail on a match error.
this is implemented under -Xexperimental
test case pending
