{{ 
's = 2
```scala

gives
```
error: value update is not a member of object Symbol
```scala

Which is misleading since an update method wouldn't do any better. For other assignments to vals I tried, including 
```
val s = 's
s = 2
```scala

I either got
```
error: reassignment to val
```scala

or for assignments to other literals
```
error: illegal start of definition
{code}
