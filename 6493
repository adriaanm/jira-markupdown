I think I just ran into this - I've got a heap dump with hundreds of thousands of {{Parsers$Failure}} objects, and they seem to be held through inherited thread locals. Am I correct in thinking that, if you have a mix of long-lived threads with short-lived parsers, that this creates a memory leak? If so, that seems quite bad to me, worse than the thread safety issues that this bug was originally about.
