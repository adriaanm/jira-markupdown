=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
scala> BigInt("10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000").isValidInt
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
```scala
res1: Boolean = false
```
=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
res1: Boolean = true
```
=== Additional information ===

From what I understood, the problematic code is in `ScalaNumericConversions.scala`:

```scala
def isValidInt = isWhole && (toInt == toLong)
```

which won't work for numbers larger than 64 bits.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.r0-b20110222191246
  - Java: 1.6.0_18
  - Operating system: GNU/Linux
(In r24891) Makes BigInt's isValidThing methods make some kind of sense.
I wish I hadn't written so much code for the numerical classes
which languishes in git tributaries.  Closes #4540, no review.
There are still other failures of ScalaNumericConversions.isValidXXX functions.
```scala
def testDoubleIsValidByte() {
    assert((0.0).isValidByte)
}
def testLongIsValidByte() {
  assert(!(1L << 32).isValidByte)
}
```
The expected behaviour - these tests should pass.
They fail in the master.

Preparing a pull request...
Pull request #363
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/363
fixes [RichDouble](RichFloat|RichLong).isValid[Byte|Short|Char|Int].
IsValidInt is overriden in BigInt:
override def isValidInt   = this >= Int.MinValue && this <= Int.MaxValue .

I am not sure how this bug can happen.
