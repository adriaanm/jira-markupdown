There is a bug in the warning about a possible string interpolation when the string contains whitespace and the dollar sign is followed by braces:
{code}
% s -Xlint
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.5 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_31).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val s = "${}"
s: String = ${}

scala> val s = " ${} "
<console>:7: warning: possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
       val s = " ${} "
               ^
s: String = " ${} "

scala> val s = "a${hello}b"
s: String = a${hello}b

scala> val s = "a${hello} b"
<console>:7: warning: possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
       val s = "a${hello} b"
               ^
s: String = a${hello} b

scala> val s = "a${hello}b "
<console>:7: warning: possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
       val s = "a${hello}b "
               ^
s: String = "a${hello}b "
{code}
No warnings should be shown in the above cases.
The "spaces" heuristic was a paulp innovation to distinguish common interpolations {{s"hello, $name"}} from stuff the compiler often does, which is to insert dollars everywhere.

Now that you can selectively turn off the warning if you are a dollar-inserting app, the improvement would be to remove the heuristic and always warn on embedded, unescaped dollars.
Ja, that comes under the purview of the warnings filter.
