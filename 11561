This functionality is already in `Ordering` which is the better way to represent an order in almost every case: you have to explicitly handle both sides, which helps prevent cases where two different subclasses each think they should be less than the other, yielding behavior that violates invariants expected by sort functions, etc..

So, yes, in hindsight it'd be kind of nice to have, but it's not worth the API change.  IMO Ordered should be quasi-deprecated anyway (weakly discouraged).
