Sure, applying a set of tests for all collections according to the "laws" of each one, instead of writing tests for each collection that overrides something on the base traits, seems a great idea. I'll take a look at Rex's project tomorrow and add tests for the methods affected by this issue.

Meanwhile, I'm fixing this issue in the Scala library. Considering you intend to run the collection tests on each pull request, is it still useful to write old JUnit tests for this?
