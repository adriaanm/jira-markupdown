(In r23250) An object with a main method can now extend its companion class
without losing the ability to run.  Also gave genjvm a wax and
polish while in the neigborhood.  Closes scala/bug#3487.

I had to get a little tricky with this one.  No review per se,
but if anyone is frightened by the prospect of the forwarders not
being marked final in this case (because as of now, they aren't)
then speak now or ACC_FINAL hold your peace.
