[~MaggieL] Scala's JSR 223 support is "minimal"; it came in as a community contribution. further improvements submitted by the community would be very welcome, but it's "out of scope for the Scala team". quotes are from https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-874. I've put the "community" tag on this and SI-7916. if there's somewhere in the documentation or the Scala website that you think inappropriately oversells our level of support for JSR 223, please point them out and I'll make sure the wording gets changed.
