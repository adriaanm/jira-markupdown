The following is for -make:transitive, not the refined build manager.

Clients of changed Java sources are not recompiled:

A.java
```scala
public class A { public void x() {} }
```

C.scala
```scala
object C { (new A).x }
```
```scala
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
```

Rename A.x to A.y:
```scala
public class A { public void y() {} }
```

Recompile:
```scala
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
```

No error is generated.  Removing .scala_dependencies and recompiling causes the error to show up properly.

Also, Java sources are always processed.
```scala
$$ scalac -Ydebug -Ybuild-manager-debug -make:transitive A.java
```

shows A.java being processed each run.
