The following is for -make:transitive, not the refined build manager.

Clients of changed Java sources are not recompiled:

A.java
{code}
public class A { public void x() {} }
{code}

C.scala
{code}
object C { (new A).x }
{code}

{code}
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
{code}

Rename A.x to A.y:
{code}
public class A { public void y() {} }
{code}

Recompile:
{code}
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
{code}

No error is generated.  Removing .scala_dependencies and recompiling causes the error to show up properly.

Also, Java sources are always processed.

{code}
$$ scalac -Ydebug -Ybuild-manager-debug -make:transitive A.java
{code}

shows A.java being processed each run.
