{code}class A(val y: Int)
class B(y: Int) extends A(y) {
  def yy = y
}
class C extends B(0) {
  override val y = -1
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(new C().yy) // prints 0 as expected
  }
}
```scala

Compared with:
```
class A(val y: Int)
class B(override val y: Int) extends A(y) {
  def yy = y
}
class C extends B(0) {
  override val y = -1
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(new C().yy) // prints -1
  }
}
{code}

I'm sure this is a duplicate, but I couldn't find the original issue right now, and need to record this for posterity. Might not actually be a bug now that I think about it.
