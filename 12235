{{val bar = new AnyRef with Bar}} doesn't compile. So 'this' boundary tells how trait can be *used* and not how it is *implemented*. And I can't see how it conceptually different from generic parameter boundaries.

Of course I won't insist on language design changes. I just had to note that it *is* visible to clients.
