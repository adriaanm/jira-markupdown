Your comment is neither helpful nor pleasant. This isn't a shell/REPL issue, this is a Scala issue (unless you're implying that SBT isn't representative)?

If you want to see this in action, the [Accord|https://github.com/wix/accord/tree/scala2.10-cleanup] codebase has a branch that cross-compiles between 2.10.3 and 2.11.1 that showcases this issue.
