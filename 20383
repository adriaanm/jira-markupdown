in 2.10/2.11 the following returns the input array, but in 2.12 the returned array is truncated to one element (the zero is dropped).
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable._ ; println(BitSet.fromBitMaskNoCopy(Array(-9223372036854775808L, 0L)).toBitMask.toList)
```

In ENSIME we were using the BitSet mask as a mechanism to encode/decode BigInts, but that now breaks.

It's no big deal, we weren't even using this functionality. I understand that this is potentially internal implementation detail.
