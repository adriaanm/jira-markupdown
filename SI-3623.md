Hearing a report that someone couldn't build trunk on linux because of a "File
name too long" error, I took a look at what the longest filenames we create
are. These are some scary manglings. Linux has a hard 255-byte limit on total
path length, and that's a best case scenario: I'm surprised we haven't hit
this harder and faster. My longest is 245 chars working out a 10 char root dir.

My longest ten:

Path and path element limits on Linux are filesystem dependent. To the best of my knowledge ext3 and ext4 have a 255 byte limit for path _elements_, but there is no overall limit for path length.

Can you reconcile this with the fact that he was able to build in "/tmp/s" but not in a longer named directory? Obviously the longest path element is the same in both cases.  Only the path is shorter.

I'm afraid I can't reconcile it. But I know for sure that on the ext3 machine I'm typing this on I have plenty of paths which are longer than 255 bytes.

You're right to flag this up ... it's a problem on all platforms. The following has a useful table summarizing the various limits,

On Windows, the situation is worse: Though NTFS is able to handle file names up to 255 chars, the Windows API commonly uses a maximum _path length_ of 260 chars. There are ways get around that limit, but even Windows 7 Explorer displays error messages when trying to delete, rename or copy files with very long file names, and so do many other Windows programs.

It would help us very much to have an option in the Scala compiler to generate short file names (i.e. < 40 chars) only.

@Scott: You could try this, which uses hashes rather than mangled FQN's above the provided limit:

{noformat}
$ scala -X | grep classfile
  -Xmax-classfile-name <n>       Maximum filename length for generated classes
{noformat}
There's no way to query the fs for the maximum file or path length from Java NIO but you could check if getPath fails up to a sensible limit like 255 (and always cap it at no more than that):

{code}
import java.nio.file._

val fs = FileSystems.getDefault

def ok(i: Int) =
  try {
    fs.getPath("x" * i)
    true
  } catch {
    case _: InvalidPathException => false
  }

val max = (255 to 1 by -1).iterator.find(ok)
max match {
  case Some(n) => println("Use up to "+n)
  case None => println("Some problem")  
}
{code}

This *may* fail if a path is too long but I don't know if the default fs providers implement this feature. On OSX it will happily report that I can create a file name of length 10 million.
Jumping on this from SI-9742. This is a pain point for docker, and my understanding is that changing the value of `-Xmax-classfile-name` isn't a usable solution because it requires everything on the class path to have been built with the same setting. I'd like to propose changing the default value to something that's safe everywhere. A quick google tells me that for ecryptfs you need source filenames to stay below 140 to be safe under encryption, so unless theres a reason not to, I'd propose going even lower than that for the default, like 128. That ensures that some bizarre ecryptfs under docker on aufs combination would still work fine.
Any progress on this?

For people interested in a workaround, if you have a directory that is not encrypted, say {{/tmp}}, you can put target <<= baseDirectory \{ file("/tmp/sbt/") / _.toString \} in {{~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt}} and move all the target output to that directory.
