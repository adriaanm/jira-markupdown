3 files attached (possibly 2 - mytext_repro_empty.txt is an empty file which something doesn't seem to like). Code below, modify XXX to pick files.

val source = scala.io.Source.fromFile(raw"C:\testfiles\myText_XXXX.txt")
val f = source.toSeq

using file  mytext_repro_empty.txt  I get 

f: Seq[Char] = Stream()

which seems right. Using  mytext_repro4.txt  I get 

f: Seq[Char] = Stream(-, ?)

which is well formed, I suppose, but don't know what the dash and question mark indicate.  Using  mytext_repro5.txt  I get

, ?)eq[Char] = Stream(

which is evidently broken. 



I do not think that is corrupt. One might say that carriage return character should not allow overwriting the content, but I guess that is how consoles work. The first two characters of the [^mytext_repro5.txt] file are a carriage return and a new line character. The scala streams are eager in their first element, but lazy in their second, so only the first character - carriage return - is read. That character moves the cursor to the beginning of the line ({{f: Seq\[Char\] = Stream(}}) and from that the printing continues, overwriting the first four characters ({{f: S}}) with {{, ?)}}, resulting in the output you described: {{, ?)eq\[Char\] = Stream(}}.

What is your expected output for such input? (In the {{toString()}} method of the Streams - as you also realized -, the first value is the eagerly consumed value, the {{?}} represents the not yet read parts.)
