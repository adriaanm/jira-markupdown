I've just tried the patched compiler. It gets past the first instance of this error -- encountered compiling the scalacheck sources, which are svn:external-ed into the Scalaz build -- but there is another case in triggered by the Scalaz sources proper.

I've got it pinned down in the debugger, so I'll narrow it down and post a test case soon.
