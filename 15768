Since it is not going down without a fight, ticket time.  Adriaan observed that Array matching is being done covariantly.  So is isInstanceOf it turns out.  The following prints "1 1" but should print "2 2".
{code}
object Test {
  def f1(x: Any) = x match { 
    case _: Array[AnyRef] => 1
    case _: Array[String] => 2
    case _                => 3
  }
  def f2(x: Any) =
    if (x.isInstanceOf[Array[AnyRef]]) 1
    else if (x.isInstanceOf[Array[String]]) 2
    else 3
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(f1(args))
    println(f2(args))
  }
}
{code}
