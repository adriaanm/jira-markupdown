Most changes I make to the syntax highlight options are not taken into account. It seems to always revert to some default (like underlining vars), no matter what I set in the preferences page. I managed to find the preferences file and modified one entry manually. It worked. 

Some settings work, though. For instance, comments, keyword color and string literal color are correctly taken into account. What I can't change is: 
 - traits being in italics
 - objects being underlined
 - vars being underlined

It might be something with settings on my machine. It's extremely frustrating though, and I can't seem to find the culprit. Is there anyone seeing this behavior? What is the file where all this is saved? I found something in `/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.ui.editors.prefs`
