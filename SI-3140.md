I've already spent some time on this ticket, but I am creating it so that it doesn't get forgotten.
Code
```scala
class As {
  trait A {
      def foo(parents: String): A = {
        (() => parents)
        null
    }
  }
}
```
detects (wrongly) a change in definition of method *foo* (parents$$1 changed to parents). For some reason a cloned symbol of trait As$$A gets changed when we try to compile again with RefinedBuildManager even without making any changes to the source class.

In this case the for loop is the source of anonymous class and since *parents* is used in the body of *for*, therefore it gets renamed to *parents$$1* in lambdalift, but the point is that this shouldn't affect the symbol that is cloned at the end of build manager process.

This is a reduced example of what I believe is happening for Types trait in symtab package. It causes (a very annoying) excessive compilation.
Replying to [comment:5 plocinic]:
> Yes, that's very possible. Thanks for the pointer!

Note: Given an `tree @ DefDef(..., vparamss, ...)`, you cannot generally assume that the symbols
```scala
vparamss map (_.map(_.symbol))
```
and
```scala
tree.tpe.paramss
```
are the same or have the same names. The same is true for type parameters, there it's actually implemented more systematically (using the infamous "skolems").
