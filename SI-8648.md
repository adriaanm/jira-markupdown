The method `scala.collection.mutable.GrowingBuilder.clear` does not actually clear the builder:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_60).

scala> val b = collection.mutable.HashSet.newBuilder[Int]
b: scala.collection.mutable.Builder[Int,scala.collection.mutable.HashSet[Int]] = scala.collection.mutable.GrowingBuilder@6094eb89

scala> b += 3
res0: b.type = scala.collection.mutable.GrowingBuilder@6094eb89

scala> b.clear()

scala> b.result()
res2: scala.collection.mutable.HashSet[Int] = Set(3)
```

It would work if the constructor parameter `empty` was passed by name instead of by value.
This is bad and hard to fix.  The problem is that GrowingBuilder takes only an *instance* of what it is supposed to grow, and has no way to create another copy.  So a GrowingBuilder cannot clear itself without this problem:

```scala
b += 3
val x = b.result
b.clear
x.length == 0  // true
```

Thus, a GrowingBuilder can only safely be used to grow exactly the Growable you give to it, which means you may as well just use the naked Growable.  For 2.11.2 I am going to add a deprecation flag to give some warning about the broken behavior; I think it's even worse to "fix" it and clobber collections you think you've already created.  Then in 2.12 I'll actually fix it.
