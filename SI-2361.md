The following code 
```scala
   null match { case x: AnyRef => 1 case _ => 0 }
```
gives <console>:5: error: unreachable code. On the other hand, tricking it into acceptance like this
```scala
   scala> (null: Any) match { case x: AnyRef => 1 case _ => 0 }
   res10: Int = 0
```
gives 0, so clearly the second case was reachable. 
There are variations of the same problem. Here is another one:
```scala
scala> def foo[T](x: Array[T]) = x match {
     |   case y: Array[AnyRef] => 1
     |   case y: Array[Int] => 2
     | }
<console>:6: error: unreachable code
         case y: Array[Int] => 2
                               ^
```
I do not see the bug in that example.
```scala
(null: Null) match { case x: AnyRef => ... } 
```
has an unreachable case because nothing of type Null can ever match a typed pattern (as specced.) (null: Any) is not the same pattern match as (null: Null), the pattern matcher takes the static type of the argument into consideration all over the place.

In fact, I would almost expect a result more like this.
```scala
scala> (5: Int) match { case x: String => true }
<console>:5: error: pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
 found   : String
 required: Int
       (5: Int) match { case x: String => true }
                                ^
```
Now if you don't want it to infer type Null for an unadorned null, that's understandable, but I don't see why an AnyRef case is reachable from a Null any more than a String case is reachable from an Int.

On the Array case, the pattern matcher ignores type parameters (it always has) so the second case is indeed unreachable.  Achieving useful pattern matching on type parameters would certainly be nice, but that is another area that's going to take me some time to understand.
Replying to [comment:2 odersky]:
> The point is that the error message `unrechable code' refers to the second branch, not the first. The pattern matcher thinks that a null always does match an AnyRef.

Oh.  I feel stupid.  In that case I think this will be a duplicate of #1609, but I'll leave them both open for the moment.
I fixed the first issue and closed #1609, but I'm leaving this open with a new title for the second.
This also generates an "unreachable code" error on the println("none"):

```scala
  def main(args: Array[String]) = args match {
    case Array(single) => println(single)
    case Array() => println("none")
    case _ => println("other")
  }
```

swapping the first two cases seems to work around it.
The remaining issue here is subsumed by #2755.
