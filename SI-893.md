"==" operator should be semantic equality between values of **same type** (Scala Language Specification, 12.1, p. 130).

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable._

val q1 = new Queue[Int]
val q2 = new SynchronizedQueue[Int]
println(q1 == q2)
```

yields true, although types of q1 and q2 are different.
