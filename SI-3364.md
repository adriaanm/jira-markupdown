object Actor.unlink(from: Actor) makes it impossible to unlink from AbstractActor instances - which you can link to with Actor.link(to: AbstractActor).

This means, for example, that you can link to remote actors, but can't unlink from them.

Since the link und unlink methods in the Actor trait both use AbstractActors, object Actor.unlink should use AbstractActors, too, shouldn't it?
