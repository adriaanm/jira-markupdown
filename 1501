The installer will only work correctly at present if a 32-bit JVM is in use: the part of the installer that updates the registry entries relies on a DLL that was compiled as 32-bit code. That library is now unsupported (was last updated in 2003). Also, we can't force a 64-bit JVM to run in 32-bit mode, as there's no "-d32" on Windows.

IzPack has its own facility to update registry entries, but the uninstaller facility seems unable to cope with multiple updates of PATH: if another program adds its own entry at a later time, a subsequent use of the IzPack uninstaller will just revert PATH, rather than upgrading (I'd be happy to be proven wrong though); this is as of IzPack 4.3.1. So this is not a good solution either; furthermore, the IzPack facility is currently broken under Windows 7 (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/IZPACK-447).

We will have to look into some other solution in order to edit the windows registry from Java; until that is done, the installer won't work correctly on 64bit JVMs, unfortunately.
