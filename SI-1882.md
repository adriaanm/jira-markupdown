I was testing the 2.7.x branch in preparation for 2.7.4-rc1 and found the following regression from 2.7.3:

test/Foo.java
```scala
package test;

import scala.RandomAccessSeq.Mutable;

class Foo {
}
```

```scala
javac -cp ~/Download/scala/scala-2.7.3.r17472/lib/scala-library.jar test/Foo.java
test/Foo.java:3: cannot access scala.RandomAccessSeq.Mutable
bad class file: scala/RandomAccessSeq$$Mutable.class(scala:RandomAccessSeq$$Mutable.class)
undeclared type variable: A
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
import scala.RandomAccessSeq.Mutable;
```

With 2.7.3:

```scala
javac -cp /opt/scala-2.7.3.final/lib/scala-library.jar test/Foo.java
```
It may help to mention that I tried the above with javac from JDK 6 update 12.
