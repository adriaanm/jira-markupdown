The weird thing is that it disappears again if another List is concatenated:

{code}
scala> val list = List(1) ++ List('a') ++ List(1L)
list: List[AnyVal] = List(1, a, 1)
{code}

Considering that getClass is already special-cased for AnyVals, would it be possible to at least clean up the REPL output?
