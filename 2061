I don't know the full story, but one thing I noticed when I enabled it and made it do some sorting is that it's defined on Traversable and returns This, but this is problematic for unsorted collections.
{code}
def sortWith(lt: (A,A) => Boolean): This

scala> Set(1,2,3,4,5).sortWith(_ < _)
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 3, 1, 4, 2)
{code}
I can't address this without some direction.
