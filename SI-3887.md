case _ =>
Another naive pattern matcher exploration.  I don't expect this to be a legitimate fix, but it works and I think it demonstrates the issue.

I think that the cause of #3887 is that when matching on a tuple and when a pattern is a stable ID, the pattern matcher assumes the pattern is a 0-tuple, which it somehow interprets to always match.

It appears that the symbol for a tuple constructor Tree is `NoSymbol` whereas a stable ID has a valid symbol.  So, in the function that checks that all patterns are wildcards or tuple constructors uses this information to do a `singleMatch` instead of a `tupleMatch` if any of the patterns has `NoSymbol` as its symbol.  A proper fix would check this the right way, whatever that is.  Alternatively, it might be preferable to keep the `tupleMatch` but expand the referenced tuple (so match on `(option1._1, option1._2)`).  I haven't evaluated that approach and I'm not familiar enough with the pattern matcher to know which way is correct.
Ha ha, did you see my old comment in TransMatcher, at the one place where caseIsOk is used?
```scala
// this appears to be an attempt at optimizing when all case defs are constructor
// patterns, but I don't think it's correct.
def doApply(fn: Tree): Boolean =
  (fn.symbol eq (selector.tpe.decls lookup nme.CONSTRUCTOR)) &&
  (cases forall caseIsOk)
```
(In r23174) Work on the pattern matcher.  Inspired by mark harrah submitting
patches for #3887 and #3888, but I determined that I could achieve
the same effect by deleting a bunch of code, so I did.  This left
only a few lines in TransMatch, so I eliminated it, which led me to
remember that many places still reference non-existent phase transmatch,
so those were updated.  Notes:

 * This swaps equality tests on stable identifier patterns.  They
 have never conformed to the spec (as noted long ago in ticket SI-785)
 which says "The pattern matches any value v such that r == v" whereas
 until now the test being performed was v == r.

 * An issue was introduced with specialization in that the implementation
 of "isTupleType" in Definitions relied upon sym == TupleClass(elems.length).
 This test is untrue for specialized tuples, causing mysterious behavior
 because only some tuples are specialized.  There is now "isTupleTypeOrSubtype"
 although it seems likely the former implementation is unnecessary.
 The issue is sidestepped if one uses "getProductArgs" to retrieve the element
 types because it sifts through the base types for the Product symbol.

Closes #3887 and #3888, review by dmharrah.
With respect to r23184, for both of my patches, I ran:
```scala
 ant all.clean test
```
and
```scala
 ant all.clean test-opt
```
and neither caused any failures.  Is this the right thing to be running?  I realize I didn't run it against your exact commit, but I wanted to check the basic ideas independently.
Replying to [comment:6 harrah]:

If you run both "all.clean test" and "all.clean test-opt" then no power in the universe can blame you for a problem.  As you can see, I'm not religious about test-opt.  And as you didn't see because I sent it to devel, it wasn't your or my fault anyway: with the patch the pattern matcher started generating code which triggered #2171.
