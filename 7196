The {{Orderings}} approach is problematic, as a search for {{Ordering\[X]}} will consult the companions of {{Ordering}} and {{PartialOrdering}}, and hit an ambiguity.

I've been personally wrestling with these tensions for six months during the Scalaz 7 rewrite. The standard library doesn't have the luxury of backwards-incompatibly reshuffling these implicits, so ad-hoc fixes concern me. (What about conjuring an {{Equiv}} from an {{Ordering}} or from a {{PartialOrdering}}?)

Ultimately, better language support for organizing and discriminating between type class instances might be required. Until then, levying a small import tax seems a reasonable option.
