I expected the following code to compile:

```scala
trait Foo {
  type Arg
  type Prod
  def makeProd(a : Arg): Prod
}

// simulate dependent method types
case class buildProd(foo: Foo) {
  def apply(a: foo.Arg): foo.Prod = foo.makeProd(a)
}

object main {
  val myFoo = new Foo{type Arg=Int; type Prod=(Int, Int); def makeProd(i: Int) = (i, i)}
  
  buildProd(myFoo)(1)
}
```

Instead, the compiler complains:
```scala
15: error: method apply cannot be accessed in buildProd
 because its instance type (Foo#Arg)Foo#Prod contains a malformed type: Foo#Arg
  buildProd(myFoo)(1)
           ^
one error found
```

It seems foo.type gets approximated to Foo too early..
I fiddled with this some more, and adding a type parameter `TFoo` to buildProd is enough to get the program to type check. This makes me think the original problem is not directly related to dependent method types (in fact, it encodes them, but I don't think it *uses* them).

```scala
case class buildProd[TFoo <: Foo](foo: TFoo) {  // now it works
  def apply(a: foo.Arg): foo.Prod = foo.makeProd(a)
}
```
But don't you need to parameterize the call also, as in:
```scala
   buildProd[myFoo.tpe](myFoo)
```
?

In a more complicated example, yes -- here, the following is inferred (-Xprint:typer):
```scala
    buildProd[java.lang.Object with Foo{type Arg = Int; type Prod = (Int, Int)}](main.this.myFoo).apply(1)
```
In 2.10.0.r24516-b20110320020044 it has changed to just a type mismatch:

```scala
scala>   buildProd(myFoo)(1)
<console>:12: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: _4.foo.Arg where val _4: buildProd
         buildProd(myFoo)(1)
                          ^
```
(extempore in [r25907](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25907)) Test case closes #102.

No review.
