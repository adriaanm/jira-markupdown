the question is if the scala compiler reads `org.infinispan.marshall.Ids` from a classfile that was previously compiled by javac, or if you pass the .java source file to the scala compiler.

if the former is true and you get the error, please provide a minimal example and re-open.

if the latter is the case (see example below), it's a duplicate of SI-2764.
