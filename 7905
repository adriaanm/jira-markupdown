No, it's not a blocker, though it is a bug generator, as a Java dependency of a Scala project I maintain added a new abstract method in a version upgrade; not having the compiler fail created a latent bug at runtime.

I understand there may not be a 2.9.3, but if there *is* I would predict it will before 2.10, and have less impact to development (and more importantly, my end users) than a 2.10 upgrade.

I'll take a look at doing the cherry-pick legwork, in the hopes that a 2.9.3 release happens. Thanks again for the quick fix.
