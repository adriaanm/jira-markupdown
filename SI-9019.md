For inner classes extending TraversableLike, stringPrefix returns the name of the surrounding object or class.

{code}
object Foo {
  class Bar extends IndexedSeq[Any] {
    def length = 0
    def apply(n: Int) = ???
  }
}
new Foo.Bar().stringPrefix // returns "Foo"
{code}

The expected output would be "Bar" (which you get if Bar is a member of a package) as stated in the docs of TraversableLike:

bq. By default the string prefix is the simple name of the collection class traversable collection.

"Foo.Bar" or "IndexedSeq" would also be reasonable results, but "Foo" is obviously wrong.

Also of note: If you paste the code into the REPL, the actual result is the empty string (because the code is defined in another surrounding object, I guess).

This issue is not specific to the 2.11.4 release, but is present in previous versions, too.
I can't tell what is the truly desirable behaviour here.
I think according to the specs Foo is the correct expectation, but I do agree it doesn't make sense.

There also seems to be a definite bug in the REPL, as empty string is just illogical here.

OK, so with some more digging here's what I see.

The stringPrefix returns the first top-level object within the package.  That means it gives no meaningful information for nested constructs.
e.g. scala.collection.TraversableLikeTest$Foo$2$Bar => TraversableLikeTest

The REPL uses some interesting naming constructs
{code}
scala> b.getClass.getName.toCharArray
res16: Array[Char] = Array($, l, i, n, e, 3, ., $, r, e, a, d, $, $, i, w, $, $, i, w, $, B, a, r)
{code}

So due to pinching the text between the last '.' and the first '$' after we end up with "" because we have .$ in the internal representation.
