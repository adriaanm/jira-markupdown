Those traces suggest the problem lies deeper in the architecture of the presentation compiler: it can be interrupted during type-checking and asked to type-check a file (but it may be the same file it was typechecking when it was interrupted in the first place). I'll open another ticket for hardening the **presentation compiler** not to allow such calls.
