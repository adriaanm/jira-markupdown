if you read `class A extends B with C` with the knowledge that `B with C` is a valid type in itself, then the syntax choice that was made here makes a lot more sense. it's `A extends (B with C)`, not `(A extends B) with C`.

Mikael, nbd, but it's better to raise this sort of thing as a thread on the scala-language mailing list first, rather than going straight to JIRA. This is something of an FAQ.
