code 1:

object Pair {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
        val T = new Pair(1, 1) {
            override def equals(x: Any) = x.isInstanceOf[(Int, Int)] && x.asInstanceOf[(Int, Int)]._1 == this._1
        }

        (1, 2) match {
            case T => println("matched")

            case _ => println("not matched")
        }
    }
}

output: matched

code 2:

object Pair {
    val T = new Pair(1, 1) {
        override def equals(x: Any) = x.isInstanceOf[(Int, Int)] && x.asInstanceOf[(Int, Int)]._1 == this._1
    }

    def main(args: Array[String]) = {

        (1, 2) match {
            case T => println("matched")

            case _ => println("not matched")
        }
    }
}

output: not matched
Attached is a naive attempt to fix the issue.  This reverses the order of the operands in the equality check to align with section 8.1.5 in the spec, which says == is called on the pattern, not the thing being matched (scrutinee?).  Another solution is to modify the spec to say that the behavior is unspecified when the equals contract is broken, as it is here.

Note that 1) and 2) of the first comment on #785 are fixed by this patch (same issue), although not in the way requested by the comment.
(In r23174) Work on the pattern matcher.  Inspired by mark harrah submitting
patches for #3887 and #3888, but I determined that I could achieve
the same effect by deleting a bunch of code, so I did.  This left
only a few lines in TransMatch, so I eliminated it, which led me to
remember that many places still reference non-existent phase transmatch,
so those were updated.  Notes:

 * This swaps equality tests on stable identifier patterns.  They
 have never conformed to the spec (as noted long ago in ticket SI-785)
 which says "The pattern matches any value v such that r == v" whereas
 until now the test being performed was v == r.

 * An issue was introduced with specialization in that the implementation
 of "isTupleType" in Definitions relied upon sym == TupleClass(elems.length).
 This test is untrue for specialized tuples, causing mysterious behavior
 because only some tuples are specialized.  There is now "isTupleTypeOrSubtype"
 although it seems likely the former implementation is unnecessary.
 The issue is sidestepped if one uses "getProductArgs" to retrieve the element
 types because it sifts through the base types for the Product symbol.

Closes #3887 and #3888, review by dmharrah.
