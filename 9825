Yeah. However, one thing I was wondering is what's the type of overridden val corresponding to an object? In other words, if we override an object and we add a new methods in the overriding object are we going to be able to see them? If so, it means that we refine a type when we override (which is what I expect) but in a super class the type is already a singleton type (of the object) so there's not much you can do, right?
