Aladdin: *[http://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/bugtracking/bugs/displayItem.do?id=1271 bug 1271], [http://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/bugtracking/contribs/display.do?id=724 contrib 724]_

Currently it's possible to match using Seq, likewise:

{code}
<pre>s match {
    case Seq(...) =>
    ...
}</pre>
{code}

But this forces the evaluation of the entire Stream. This is an undesired effect when using Streams.

I would like something like..

{code}
s match {
    case Stream(...) =>
    ...
}
{code}

This will pattern match against Stream(...) using regular Scala patterns, while forcing the evaluation of only the necessary number of elements. Thus for example,

{code}
s match {
    case Stream(A, B, _*) => ...
}
{code}

Would only force the evaluation of the first 2 elements in the stream
