In dotty I propose to no longer allow nested classes with the same name which shadow each other. It's less convenient that way, but a lot safer.

instead of:

{code}
trait Core extends Base {
  class Status
}

trait Ext extends Core {
  class Status extends super.Status
}
{code}

write:

{code}
trait Core extends Base {
  class Status
}

trait Ext extends Core {
  class StatusExt extends Status
}
{code}
