Man, I ran into a case today where I really wanted to write
```scala
doUpdate(_.copy(someField = _, anotherField = _))
```
but instead I had to write
```scala
doUpdate((a, b, c) => a.copy(someField = b, anotherField = c))
```

Not a bug, as spec'd, etc.; but am I correct in guessing that this proposed change would mean that the parser would recognize `someField = _` as a named arg and not an expression, so that the former would be a valid anonymous function? Because that would be pretty nifty.
