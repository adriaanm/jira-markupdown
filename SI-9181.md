Exhaustivity checking becomes a significant proportion of compilation time when the number of case clauses exceeds about 100. Given this source (for 400 case clauses),

https://gist.github.com/RadoBuransky/d1d763a8f3c6555ee89a

the compilation time appears to scale worse than linearly if and only if the trait is marked `sealed`, as shown on the attached graph.

@paulp reports that this is a regression from 2.11.4.
