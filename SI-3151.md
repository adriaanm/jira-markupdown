Hi,

I just finished reading "Scala By Example" (Oct. 28 2009) and found the errors below. Note that I'm new to Scala, so I hope they are not just my misunderstanding :-)

- Page 1: "consise" -> "concise"

- Page 74: "(xn op acc)" -> "(xn op z)"

- Page 101: "any number beyond 3" -> "any number beyond 1003" or "any number beyond the 3rd"

- Page 105: "private def skip" -> "private def skip ="

            "BufferedIterator[a]" -> "BufferedIterator[A]"

            "new Iterator[(a, b)]" -> "new Iterator[(A, B)]"

            "{Iterator.this.next, that.next}" -> "(Iterator.this.next, that.next)"

- Page 106: There are two implementations of next which are very similar in functionality, but written in two different styles, one of which is uglier :-) (not a typo, but might be better to be consistent in style guidelines)

- Page 114: "def" is in bold and shouldn't be (or change it to any other arbitrary string)

- Page 115: (2 occurrences) "y1" -> "y"

- Page 116: (2 occurrences "implicit c" -> the "c" shouldn't be italic (at least I don't see why)

- Page 133: (3 occurrences) "return" -> "ret" (and not in bold)

            (2 occurrences) "abstract type t" -> "abstract type T"

            "by calling the isOpen guard" -> "by calling the channel's write guard" (or something else)


P.S.
I apologize if this is not the place to report it - I couldn't find any mention of the proper contact point in the book or site, and no one on the irc channel knew either... that's another suggestion in itself - the book should specify a source and/or contact url/address. I saw some previous reports here regarding the book, so I hope this is the right place.
(In r21300) Fixed #3151
Thanks for the fix! There are a couple that were missed:

- Page 74: "acc" should be "z" ("acc" is undefined)
- Page 105: missing "=" before skip method implementation block

The others deal with formatting rather than typos, so they're less important. And indeed the prime number example should state 1013 rather than 1003 - thanks for correcting!
