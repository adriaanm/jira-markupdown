XMLEventReader takes a *scala.io.Source* instance as input. When the xml file associated to the Source instance contains lines which exceed 2^20^ characters -- at least this is the value I understand from the source code -- *scala.io.Position* yields an Exception due to an integer overflow and the parsing aborts.

In order to reproduce this behavior, any xml file with a single line exceeding *scala.io.Position* 's internal counter will suffice. 

IMHO the correct solution would be to enhance scala.io.Postion to support long lines, i.e., to enhance it to use *Long* instead of *Int* for internal representation. A fix could be -- as suggested on the scala-users mailinglist -- to at least ignore the overflow. In this way, the parser could finish.

I filed this bug ticket to the "standard library" component, because the problematic behavior appears in *scala.io.Position*.

  - Scala: 2.9.0.r24471-b20110317020039
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.7
I see that I already tried to play defense against this.
```scala
  // we'd like to default to no positioning, but for now we break
  // less by defaulting to status quo.
  def withPositioning(on: Boolean): this.type = {
    positioner = if (on) new Positioner else NoPositioner
    this
  }
```
So "source withPositioning false" will make the problem go away.
@Extempore: It's good news to know how to bypass the restriction with current Scala versions. But I would propose to enhance the documentation: *withPositioning* has no Doc-Text and -- maybe I'm here alone, but I doubt it -- it's difficult to find this solution, if you're not one of the library developers. Thus, this might be prominently explained in the description of Source.
(In r24717) Changed scala.io.Position into something other than a fixed object which
throws exceptions when the position overflows.  Closes #4382, no review.
