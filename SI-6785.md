It would be convenient to be able to access a symbol's flags directly. For example, if we want to implement a trait's methods in a macro, but don't have access to a tree for the trait, we currently have to iterate through the trait type's declarations and manually create Modifiers for each by reconstructing the flags from the method symbol's isPrivate, etc. methods.

See [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13767582/334519) for a more detailed discussion of the issue.
I was very close to fixing this issue in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3452, but in the end I decided against it, because just flags are unlikely to be enough.

When creating flags based on someone else's flags it is oftentimes necessary to negate some bits or to only obtain a subset of those bits - something that's currently not available in the API, and exposing all that stuff on the verge of #6267 seems a bit too much.

If you feel that you need flags in the public API, please speak up - I will be glad to re-evaluate the "won't fix" given strong evidence.

#6785 exposes Symbol.flags, setFlag and resetFlag

My first feeling was not to expose Symbol.flags, because that would
inevitably lead to exposing more methods on FlagSet. However we do need
flag manipulation in async, which is representative of advanced macros,
so I'm caving in.
