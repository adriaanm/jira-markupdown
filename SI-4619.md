It's common (esp in finance) to have to multiply and divide decimal amounts by powers of ten (converting from pounds to pence for example). It would be nice to write:

{{{
   val pence = pounds.movePointRight(2)
}}}

Currently this looks a bit messy:

{{{
   val pence = BigDecimal(pounds.underlying.movePointRight(2))
}}}
These methods exist on java.math.BigDecimal. The Scala wrapper has many fewer methods — likely for no real reason except that whoever wrote the wrapper, years ago, had better things to do.

Going through and adding this and other missing methods to the wrapper — with tests, of course — would make a great community/Scalathon contribution, I think.
I'm currently not on my dev machine, but I extracted the changes from the old branch:
