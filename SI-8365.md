{code}
class A {
  this match {
    case this => println("foo")
    case _ => ???
   }
}
{code}

A.scala:3: error: '.' expected but '=>' found.
    case this => println("foo")
              ^
A.scala:4: error: identifier expected but ';' found.
    case _ => ???
^
two errors found

The type test already works. The recent issue clarifying eq for singleton type pattern is potentially confusing. Would this test ==?
{code}
this match { case _: this.type =>  case this => }
{code}
> the first case would test `this eq this`, the second case would be `this == this` (just in case!)

Now we just need a test-case which leverages this for a "this" of Double. :-)
