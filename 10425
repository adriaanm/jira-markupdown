Btw, after I've looked at the compiler's code long enough on the plan today, I believe that it should be possible to write a sufficiently robust function that transforms a TypeTree back into a TypTree, even if the original isn't specified. 

It wouldn't work in general case, when someone assigned crazy symbols to some parts of a TypeTree using a macro or a compiler plugin, but within the compiler and for well-behaving macros, I believe, it should work fine. I'm going to explore this avenue for scala/bug#8066.
