Compiler fails to compile the following code:
```scala
object Test {
	sealed trait A
	case object A1 extends A
}

trait Something[T]

case class Test() extends Something[Test.A]
```
However, if Test is an ordinary class, it works.
You're right, it's the same problem, and this ticket is very very helpful because it establishes that the addition of ProductN did not create the problem, it only exacerbated the existing one.
Reduced.
```scala
trait Something[T]
object Test { class A }
case class Test() extends Something[Test.A]
```
