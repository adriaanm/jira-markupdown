The `OpenHashMap` class doesn't decrement its `deleted` count (of deleted hash table entries that haven't been re-used) when an entry is placed into a previously-used slot.

The effect is that {{deleted}} only grows—with every entry removed, irrespective of whether removed entries were re-used with a subsequent {{put()}}—causing the table to be expanded prematurely (at which point {{deleted}} is reset to zero).
