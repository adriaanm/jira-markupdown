Remember regular expression patterns? Me neither, since they entered and left the language before I showed up.  But that's the culprit here since as we may have noticed, Array(a,b*) is not valid (current) scala syntax.  Fixed-ish in r21973.  I have in the past tried to remove the remaining vestiges but STARmode put up a fight.

SI-3050 is unrelated.
