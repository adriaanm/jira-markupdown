as of r18376:
```scala
scala> "foobar" containsSlice "oo" 
<console>:5: warning: method containsSlice in trait SequenceTemplate is deprecated: Should be repaced by <code>indexOf(that) != -1</code>
       "foobar" containsSlice "oo"
                ^
res0: Boolean = false
```

I'm unhappy about the deprecation (testing for -1 is a big step backwards IMO), but more importantly, the answer is wrong. it should be true not false.
