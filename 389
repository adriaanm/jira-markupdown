The second example still crashes the compiler:
{code}
object Obj extends Clss[Int] with (Clss[T] forSome {type T})
{code}

In addition, I remain a little concerned about this fix. Why should Clss[T forSome {type T}] be legal while (Clss[T] forSome {type T}) is not? It seems that the only difference is the scope of T. I would prefer to understand the meaning of the construct, if any, before we decide whether to forbid it.

Anyway, sorry to reopen, but I think at least the compiler crash should be recorded.
