Nobody has ever been very happy with the default argument to getLines, that is a certainty.  It manages to fail to cover the common "don't care" case while at the same time breaking another thing which you might not like, in that
```scala
// this worked in 2.7, not now
file.getLines
```
because once there are default arguments you can't omit the parameter list entirely, you have to give empty parens.

So I'm going to remove the default argument and make it like 2.7.  The expert I'd want to hand this off to, who as yet I don't know exists, is the guy who knows enough about all the platform-specific inanity to see through the haze to the least bad platform compromise.
