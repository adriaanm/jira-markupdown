Named and default arguments have been introduced in Scala 2.8, and were outlined in SIP #1. An important scenario has been overlooked in the SIP, which is to define interaction of named and default arguments with pattern matching cases. Adding support for named arguments in pattern matching improves Scala in two ways:

(1) It increases the regularity of the language in the sense that a feature (named arguments) is applicable to more scenarios, and case class constructor calls and pattern cases are more symmetrical
(2) It brings the benefits of named arguments to a widely used feature of Scala (pattern matching): Avoiding boiler plate, and avoiding mistakes when multiple arguments of the extractor have the same type.

Example:

{code}
    case class Advance(time: Long, isSeek: Boolean, isPlaying: Boolean, added: List[Any] = Nil, removed: List[Any] = Nil)
{code}

An instance of this class can be conveniently created such as this:

{code}
    Advance(time=0L, isSeek=false, isPlaying=true)
{code}

But a pattern match is only possible like this:

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(time, isSeek, isPlaying, added, removed) => ...
    }
{code}

With a real trap like the following:

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(time, isPlaying, isSeek, removed, added) => ...
    }
{code}

Or even this, if not all arguments are used and therefore undergoing successive type checks:

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(isSeek, isPlaying, time, _, _) => ...
    }
{code}

Cf. [here|https://github.com/Sciss/SoundProcesses3/commit/fd8234992e30fd79ce309c09303af5b42e62d93e#commitcomment-1997303]

If named arguments were allowed, the following would be valid:

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(time = t, isSeek = false, isPlaying = true, removed = r, added = a) => ...
    }
{code}

Furthermore, if a "default" argument in an extractor is equated with {{_}}, the following would be valid:

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(isPlaying = true) => ...
    }
{code}

...and equivalent to...

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(time = _, isSeek = _, isPlaying = true, removed = _, added = _) => ...
    }
{code}

Cutting boiler plate in pattern match cases and make them more readable.

A problem I can see is where arguments are omitted but no named arguments used, such as:

{code}
    def update(u: Any) = u match {
      case Advance(time, isSeek) => ...
    }
{code}

In the constructor case this would be only legal if default arguments were given for {{isPlaying}}, {{added}} and {{removed}}, whereas in the deconstruction/extractor case it would be always legal if a default of {{_}} is implied for each argument. Perhaps a compromise would be to allow default arguments only where named arguments are used?

Duplicate of SI-4425 and SI-3353.
I don't see this as a duplicate; those are bugs which deal with default arguments for implicit parameters _in the unapply method_; i.e. with arguments _supplied to_ the pattern matcher, not the _results from_ the pattern matcher. Anyway, my main case is named arguments which is unrelated to those issues.
Well, from the title of the bug that looks like 'named and default arguments'. And fixing those bugs means defining the correct behaviour for the things your want. So, they are definitely related (and I would say sort of duplicates).

See for example Lukas' comment on SI-3353:
"There's a whole space to explore on the interaction of named/default arguments and pattern matching. If we start doing this, we will end up with this kind of blocks during pattern matching (and btw, blocks don't need to have symbols)."

I didn't close this bug because you kind of rely on the bugs I mentioned. And I guess if we want to be formal SIP would be the proper way.
Of course it is loosely related, because this issue (which is not a bug but a feature request!) and the two bugs linked both involve default arguments. But this:

{code}
    object Foo {
      object X { def unapply(x : Int)(y: Int) = Some((2,2)) }
      42 match { case _ X _ => () }
    }
{code}

has nothing to do with allowing named and default arguments in pattern match cases, unless I am missing something, and I'm trying hard to think of how they would be related, or how this feature request relies on those bugs? In the other example

{code}
    object X { def unapply(x : Int)(y : Option[Int] = None) = None }
{code}

the point seems to be allowing to match using an {{unapply}} method which has multiple parameter lists (explicit or implicit) for which defaults exists. How would fixing those bugs produce correct/desired behaviour in this case?
The problem with {{==}} is that you can't distinguish it from a {{Boolean}} expression which is totally valid, too. Of course, the difference is that {{isSeek}} is an argument name. So this produces the same confusion as with catching symbols versus backtick escaping, e.g.

{code}
val isSeek: Boolean = ???

def m(a: Any) = a match {
  case Advance(t = time, { println("hi there"); false == isSeek }) => ...
}
{code}

To use the value, you would need to write {{false == `isSeek`}}

Here is another suggestion, using the left-arrow from for-comprehensions:

{code}
case Advance(t <- time, false <- isSeek)

case Person(LegalToDrink(a) <- age)
case Person(ltd @ LegalToDrink(a) <- age)
case Person(ltd: LegalToDrink <- age)
{code}

The advantage of this IMO is that it doesn't introduce any new syntactic concept or variant, but is well established. On the other hand, in for-comprehensions the left-arrow indicates that the symbol is a looping variable, something that is not the case here.

-----

A third suggestion would be to require guards for {{==}}. Something like

{code}
    case Advance(t <- time) if !isSeek =>
{code}

One would then be free to use {{=}} instead of {{<-}}, e.g.

{code}
case Advance(t = time) if !isSeek =>

case Advance(val t = time) if !isSeek =>
{code}
