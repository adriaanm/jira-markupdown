The following code gives an incorrect dead code warning:
{code}
object Test extends App {
  val Yes1 = true
  val Yes2 = true
  val No1 = false
  val No2 = false

  def test(b1: Boolean, b2: Boolean) {
    (b1, b2) match {
      case (No1, No2) => println("1")
      case (No1, Yes2) => println("2")
      case (Yes1, No2) => println("3")
      case (Yes1, Yes2) => println("4")
    }   
  }

  test(No1, Yes2)
}
{code}

When compiling this, I get the wraning:

{code}
[error] test.scala:14: unreachable code
[error]       case (No1, Yes2) => println("2")
{code}

However, when run, it does print "2", so it is clearly not dead code.

It looks like it has something to do the Booleans. If I change all the Booleans to Int's with values of 0/1, the dead code error goes away.

This same code does not produce a warning in scala 2.9.2.

The warning is correct, because the types of Yes1/Yes2/No1/No2 are "Boolean", they are not true constants - so you haven't actually covered any of the boolean space. It goes away with Ints because the pattern matcher doesn't aspire to exhaustively checking four billion values, but it can check two.

Declare the constants so they will be seen as such, and the warning goes away:
{code}
final val Yes1 = true
final val Yes2 = true
final val No1 = false
final val No2 = false
{code}
Ah, I was thinking it says "not exhaustive" because that's all it says in master. So the unreachable warning is already fixed.
{noformat}
<console>:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: (??, false), (??, true), (false, ??), (false, false), (false, true), (true, ??), (true, false), (true, true)
           (b1, b2) match {
           ^
defined object Test
{noformat}

Similar to SI-7369. After its fix, (https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/62713964), the reachability warning is gone, but the spurious (or at least, over-reaching) exhaustiveness warning remains.
