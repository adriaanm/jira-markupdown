(I know the temptation will be to assign this right back to me, but as must be obvious there's no way I'm going to catch up on the pattern matcher bugs anytime super soon.  Still trying.)
Here is another type parameter escape.  No conversion in this one.
{code}
scala> (null: Any) match { case List(x @ _*) => x }
res0: Seq[A] = null
