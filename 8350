@Hubert I'm sorry that you had problems digging up Berkeley DB JE. This seems to come from the curse of Ivy (?) that dependency repositories are not transitory :-( With sbt's local cache it's often not clear that something is missing, as was the case here.

The missing repo for com.sleepycat should be 

{{
resolvers += "Oracle Repository" at "http://download.oracle.com/maven"
}}

Is there any trick to include that in the pom so that it shows up in dependent projects?\

I added the resolver to the mentioned branch (cyclic_bug), so hopefully it should proceed to compilation stage now
