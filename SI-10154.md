This is a regression introduced by [this PR|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5550] relating to the detection of term-owned companions. It looks as though it inadvertently broke the case where the type is the singleton type of an object, and so the companion is the object itself. The "object is the companion of its own singleton type" property is exploited by shapeless's {{Poly}}'s, and so the result is that this breaks all method-local examples in the shapeless tests.

The following is a standalone reproduction of the issue,

```scala
trait Bar2[T]

object Test2 {
  def wrap {
    object Foo {
      implicit def fooBar: Bar2[Foo.type] = ???
    }

    implicitly[Bar2[Foo.type]]
  }
}
```

This compiles with 2.12.1, but fails with 2.12.2 (`"could not find implicit value for parameter e: shapeless.Bar2\[Foo.type\]"`). If the definition of `object Foo` is moved out of `wrap` then the code compiles with 2.12.2.
