The following compiles, yet neither method is callable due to ambiguity (although I have yet to be pointed to where in the spec that is considered ambiguous).
{code}
object Foo {
  def bar(i: Int) = println(i)
  def bar(i: Int) (f: Float) = println(i*f)
}
{code}
the spec of overloading resolution handles curried applications one by one. for the application

{code}
  foo.bar(10)(2.0f)
{code}

overloading resolution is done on the application {{foo.bar(10)}} without looking at the second parameter list.

Could you point me to the exact place in the spec?

> overloading resolution is done on the application {{foo.bar(10)}} without looking at the second parameter list.

Is there a particular reason for this? (I assume there is, so I'm fishing for the reason).

Nightly build: http://www.scala-lang.org/node/212/pdfs, Section 6.25.3

Simplicity I guess (in both, spec and implementation)

In both cases the expected result type is Unit. Could you please give an example of how these two methods can be called? I have tried the following, all of which fails (presumably because the return type is the same for both methods?)
{code}
  bar(5): Unit
  val u1: Unit = bar(5)
  bar(5)(2f): Unit
  val u2: Unit = bar(5)(2f)
{code}
Replying to [comment:7 moors]:
> no, the result type is not the same if you partially apply the methods

But if I don't partially apply, they are.

>  `bar(5): Unit` vs `bar(5):  Float => Unit`

Both fail. Please try before closing again.

These are the two errors I get:
{code}
  bar(5): Unit // ambiguous reference to overloaded definition, both method bar in object Foo of type (i: Int)(f: Float)Unit and  method bar in object Foo of type (i: Int)Unit match argument types (Int)
  bar(5): Float => Unit // not a legal formal parameter
  bar(5): (Float => Unit) // ambiguous reference to overloaded definition, both method bar in object Foo of type (i: Int)(f: Float)Unit and  method bar in object Foo of type (i: Int)Unit match argument types (Int)
{code}
Sorry, thanks for persisting (in the future, it would help, though, to simply copy/paste output from the interpreter, as I've done below)

Martin: I tried out various combinations of argument types, and could refer to the overload with one argument list (except not in the given example -- see below for one where I did manage), but never to the one with two.

{code}
scala> object Foo {
     |   def bar(i: Int) = println(i)
     |   def bar(i: Int) (f: Float) = println(i*f)
     | }
defined module Foo

scala> Foo.bar(5): (Float => Unit)
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in object Foo of type (i: Int)(f: Float)Unit
and  method bar in object Foo of type (i: Int)Unit

       Foo.bar(5): (Float => Unit)
           ^

scala> object x{def a(i: String): Option[String] = Some("a"); def a(i: String)(b:  List[String]): Int = 1}
defined module x

scala> x.a("a"): Option[String]
res10: Option[String] = Some(a)

scala> def f(xs: List[String]): Int = x.a("a")(xs)

> I see, but would classify this as a corner case due to the unit conversion. There's no attempt in the spec to classify overloads that will always yield ambiguous errors when referenced as illegal.

That would be fine if there was _some_ way to call the second method. There is not (that I know of, short of using reflection).
I was using Eclipse, which is why I couldn't easily copy/paste my results. Apologize for that. Here's more using a slightly modified version (returning Float) from the console:
{code}
scala> object Foo {def bar(i:Int):Float=i;def bar(i:Int)(f:Float)=i*f;}
defined module Foo

scala> Foo.bar(5)
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in object Foo of type (Int)(Float)Float
and  method bar in object Foo of type (Int)Float
match argument types (Int)
       Foo.bar(5)
           ^

scala> Foo.bar(5)(3.2f)
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in object Foo of type (Int)(Float)Float
and  method bar in object Foo of type (Int)Float
match argument types (Int)
       Foo.bar(5)(3.2f)
           ^

scala> Foo.bar(5): Float
res2: Float = 5.0

scala> Foo.bar(5)(3.2f): Float
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in object Foo of type (Int)(Float)Float
and  method bar in object Foo of type (Int)Float
match argument types (Int)
       Foo.bar(5)(3.2f): Float
           ^

scala> Foo.bar(5) _
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in object Foo of type (Int)(Float)Float
and  method bar in object Foo of type (Int)Float
match argument types (Int)
       Foo.bar(5) _
           ^

scala> Foo.bar(5): (Float=>Float)
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in object Foo of type (Int)(Float)Float
and  method bar in object Foo of type (Int)Float
match argument types (Int)
       Foo.bar(5): (Float=>Float)
           ^
{code}
It does not seem right that one can define methods that simply cannot be called. I would much prefer that both methods could be called, since they do not appear ambiguous to me
{code}
  Foo.bar(5)      // Unambiguously calls the single parm variant
  Foo.bar(5) _    // Unambiguously calls the double parm variant partially
  Foo.bar(5)(2f)  // Unambiguously calls the double parm variant.
{code}
Short of that, it seems that the same ambiguity rules should be applied to defs, preventing creation of methods that are impossible to reference.
"Short of that, it seems that the same ambiguity rules should be applied to defs, preventing creation of methods that are impossible to reference." I just wrote above that there is no attempt to do such a thing in the spec. I challenge you to give a set of complete and decidable rules to do this. 

So in Scala, it should be possible to define methods that no one can call? That's a rather odd goal.
As I've said before, I would prefer that the methods could actually be called, rather than ambiguity being determined by the first argument list only, but that is also not a goal.
So that leaves one with a rather odd situation of having methods that compile fine, and can be unambiguously referenced by any human, yet the Scala compiler, which has a general goal in other aspects to be smart, cannot.
