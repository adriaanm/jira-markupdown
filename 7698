Normally, mutable maps use themselves as builders.

The `mutable.MapBuilder` is in the `mutable` package because builders are mutable data structures.
The class itself is however **used** by the maps in the `immutable` package, because it provides an efficient way to build immutable maps.
Other than changing the name MapBuilder to something else, or restricting the `mutable.MapBuilder` type parameter to take only immutable maps, I don't see much that can be done.
Note that changing the type parameter is problematic, since it causes backwards compatibility problems. We could introduce a `MutableMapBuilder` and an `ImmutableMapBuilder`, however.
