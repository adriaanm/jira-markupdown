I took a look and submitted pull request 359.

This commit just changes the assert on a bad abstract super.m to a compiler error. Probably it's the not that simple, right? In this case, review (and rejection) is easy; but if it weren't, should I ask on scala-internals or on the jira ticket? By way of not wasting people's time? I was just looking for small bugs as an excuse to look at code.

This is a great learning experience, but in mid-learning-curve, I don't have a lot of visibility into the code or even a feeling that I'm not doing something dumb or, worse, counter-productive.

Needless to add, test suite passes and collaborator license agreement is verified.
