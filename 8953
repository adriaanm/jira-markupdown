The minimal test case that generates the error seems to be:
```scala
def test(kryo: Kryo, input:Input, typ: Class[Map[_,_]]): Map[_,_] = {
	val len = 7
	var coll: Map[Any, Any] = {
		try { 
			val someVar = null;
			Map[Any,Any]().empty 
		} catch { 
			case _ => Map[Any,Any]().empty 
		}
	}
	0 until len foreach {_ => coll += Tuple2( 0, 0) }
	coll
}
```

Looks similar to scala/bug#5380 , and seems to be related to the wrapping of "coll" into a scala.runtime.ObjectRef . someVar is required but probably just prevents some other optimization.
