Sure. If we decide to delay the release, can we wait until tomorrow, so that Denys and I can roll out a fix to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8387? (the fix is trivial, but I'd like to consult with Denys to make sure it'll work okay).

upd. I'd like to emphasize that scala/bug#8387 is very important for macros, as it creates a major flaw in a frequently used quasiquote pattern, which we won't be able to easily fix later on, because people will naturally grow dependent on its current behavior.
