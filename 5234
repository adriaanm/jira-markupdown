I ported a 137K loc apache Java project to 104K loc of Scala.
I then pushed the parameterized types down to the base classes
in the project's class hierarchy. It was at this point that I
got the exception. With further refactoring the exception no
longer happened.
I tried to make a simple test case but failed. 
I figure you don't want the 104K loc snapshot of my project.
