scala> (1 to 3).scan(10)(_+_)
res0: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(10, 11, 13, 16)

scala> (1 to 3).par.scan(10)(_+_)
res1: scala.collection.parallel.immutable.ParSeq[Int] = ParVector(10, 11, 3, 6)

Is this acceptable?
Yes my bad i missed the neutral part. I guess api use intuition made me think i could use anything there.
So for subtraction where there is only right identity you get wrong results again:

scala> (1 to 3).par.scan(0)(_ - _)
res2: scala.collection.parallel.immutable.ParSeq[Int] = ParVector(0, -1, -1, -4)

scala> (1 to 3).scan(0)(_ - _)
res3: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(0, -1, -3, -6)

 Shouldnt be a contract there or some warning for such errrors?
