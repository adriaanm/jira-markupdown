On installing the new plugin, every line of (previously compiling) Scala code displays errors such as : 

- Syntax error on tokens, ClassHeaderName expected instead
- Syntax error : insert ":" to complete statement
- Syntax error : insert "}" to complete class body
- etc.

After doing Project-> clean build, the errors disappear. But once a new line of (legitimate code) is added, the errors reappear once again
This is 2.7.4, right?

Try Window => Preferences => JDT Weaving and if disabled then enable and follow the instructions to restart.
