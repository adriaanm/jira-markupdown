I cannot reproduce the problem, on my machine it says:
{code}
      [fsc] [VM arguments: ]
      [fsc] [Temp directory: /Users/cunei/tmp]
      [fsc] [Executed command: scala scala.tools.nsc.CompileServer]
      [fsc] [Port number: 53411]
      [fsc] [Connected to compilation daemon at port 53411]
      [fsc] [Starting new compile server instance]
{code}
It is not unlikely that this got solved as a side effect of other fixes. Can you please verify if you still see this problem?
