I agree with [~ichoran] that "adding strict alternative" is technically orthogonal to the deprecation. So IMHO* somebody could already start implementing that, following RÃ¼diger's plans. (Even if we wouldn't do #2, we'll need the same implementations).

But [~dragos] is right if the overall goal of the bug is not "offer both behaviors at all" but "fix latent bugs where clients use the lazy variant but shouldn't". Under *that* goal, deprecation is essential to the overall goal. I think that's a good goal, since Scala tries to reduce pitfalls. The only downside is that some users will have to change their code just to confirm they mean to use the lazy version.
