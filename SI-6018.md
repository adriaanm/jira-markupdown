The invocation of
```scala
    c.typeCheck(arg, typeOf[java.util.Date], silent = true))
```
(where `c` is of type `scala.reflect.makro.Typers`) might change the `tpe` field of the argument `arg`. I was expecting a more functional behavior of this method.

In my case, `arg` was a tree of type `java.util.Calendar`, and after the typeCheck call (which fails as expected) `arg.tpe` is `<<error>>`.
