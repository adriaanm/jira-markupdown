After lots of writing and attempting to explore this area, I finally understand both why the compiler generate code uses new (has to do with the contract around constructor inheritance which does not work for the apply method) and why it cannot use new + {} when the class is marked abstract. So, the current compiler behavior appears to be optimal leaving only option 1 as viable; updating the spec to accurately reflect what the compiler is already generating (or not generating in the case of abstract).
