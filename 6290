Realistically, I think nothing will ever be done about this because it would break too much existing code that relies on the lazy behavior. So maybe the best way forward would be to add eager methods with a similar name? 

In the new scala.collection.mutable.LongMap/AnyRefMap, @Ichoran added a method *mapValuesNow* . Maybe we should just add *mapValuesNow* and *filterKeysNow* to the map interface and implement it in the other collections? For immutable.HashMap, mapValuesNow would be easy to implement and very efficient.
