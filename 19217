When using {{Map.filterKeys}}, the given predicate has to be a total function, instead of a function defined only on the keys. Otherwise {{get}} will fail.

This might be unexpected.

 Current code in {{collection.MapLike.scala/FilteredKeys}} (line ~ 234):

{code}
    override def contains(key: A) = self.contains(key) && p(key)
    def get(key: A) = if (!p(key)) None else self.get(key)
{code}

Note how {{contains}} first checks containment inside the map, and thus queries the predicate only for contained elements, thus preventing the unexpected behaviour.

But {{get}} does not perform this check.

So decide upon the following:
- either demand a total function as predicate in the documentation (and change {{contains}})
- or go with predicates that are only defined on the elements of the map and change {{get}}.
