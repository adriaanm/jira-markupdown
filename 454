My interpretation based on the somewhat difficult to parse spec and the current behaviour is that if I can refer to something by an identifier then it should be eligibile to be passed as an implicit argument.

The problem here actually seems to be somewhat different. It appears that while we have:

{code}
scala> perhaps[String]
res0: Option[String] = Some(Hello)
{code}

The type parameter is incorrectly picked up when we assign a type to the overall expression:

{code}
scala> (perhaps : Option[String])
<console>:7: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Nothing was fou
nd.
       (perhaps : Option[String])
        ^
{code}

So I think this is probably the source of the problem, not the actual implicits mechanism?

Incidentally, I tried to see what would happen if I attempted this with 

{code}
implicit val foo : Nothing = null;
{code}

And blew up the compiler again, in more or less the same manner as SI-590. I'll attach a comment about that there.
