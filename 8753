"Who knows what someone might be doing with a Unit." is a reasonable comment, so here's the justification...

1. As much as possible, I should be able to replace a normal method with a macro without affecting clients of that method.
2. The specific situation where this might come up is when a user redefines a previously side-effecting task to do nothing, such as `publish := ()` to disable publishing.  Examples usually use {}, but because () is allowed for normal methods, we're back to number 1.
