= problem =
When transforming XML, it is often necessary to transform attribute values as well as elements. It would be nice to be able to write something like:

```scala
case elem: Elem => elem.copy(attributes=
  for (attr <- elem.attributes) yield attr match {
    case attr@Attribute("attrToChange", _, _) => attr.copy(value=Text("newValue"))
    case other => other
  }
)
```

This doesn't work in Scala 2.8.1 because `xml.Attribute.copy` only allows the `next` attribute to be changed, and because map over an `xml.MetaData` yields an `Iterable[MetaData]` not a `MetaData`.

= enhancement recommendation =

To solve the copying problem, `xml.Attribute` could grow a method like one of the `xml.Attribute.apply` methods, e.g.:

```scala
def copy(pre: String = this.pre, key: String = this.key, value: Seq[Node] = this.value, next: MetaData = this.next): Attribute
```

Solving the map problem probably means updating `Attribute` to use the new collections APIs better - e.g. it should probably implement `IterableLike[MetaData, MetaData]` which I think means it needs a simple `Builder` that sets the `next` attributes appropriately.
