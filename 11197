the quick fix would be to change
```scala
    <staged-build with="locker"   stage="quick" project="scaladoc" version="scaladoc"/> </target>
```

to
```scala
    <staged-build with="locker"   stage="quick" project="scaladoc" /> </target>
```

no idea why we were using scaladoc.version.number -- I can't see it being defined anywhere
