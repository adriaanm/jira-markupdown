In SeqView's scaladoc:
```scala
def flatten[B]: Seq[B]
[use case] Converts this sequence of traversable collections into a sequence formed by the elements of these traversable collections.
```

But scala compiler does not accept SeqView.flatten as a Seq:

```scala
scala> Seq(Seq(1)).view.flatten
res0: scala.collection.SeqView[Seq[Int],Seq[Seq[Int]]]#Transformed[Int] = SeqViewN(...)

scala> res0: Seq[Int]
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.SeqView[Seq[Int],Seq[Seq[Int]]]#Transformed[Int]
 required: Seq[Int]
              res0: Seq[Int]
              ^

scala> var left:scala.collection.SeqView[Seq[Int],Seq[Seq[Int]]]#Transformed[Int] = _
left: scala.collection.SeqView[Seq[Int],Seq[Seq[Int]]]#Transformed[Int] = null

scala> left = res0
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.SeqView[Seq[Int],Seq[Seq[Int]]]#Transformed(in trait TraversableViewLike)[Int]
 required: scala.collection.SeqView[Seq[Int],Seq[Seq[Int]]]#Transformed(in trait SeqViewLike)[Int]
       left = res0
              ^
```
```scala

```
`.view.flatten` is a `Seq` at run-time, but it is not at compiler-time. Maybe there are some wrong mix-ins order of some traits.
