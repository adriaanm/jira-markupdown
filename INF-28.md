The scala-lang navigation menu (http://www.scala-lang.org/) has an entry labeled Documentation > vscaladoc, which links to
http://scala-tools.org/scaladocs/scala-library/2.7.1/

This is a link to an older version of the docs (2.7.1).

2.7.3 vscaladoc is not yet available on the scala-tools site, so scala-lang can't link to it yet, unfortunately. (I have emailed the site owner to request an update.)

To avoid confusion among site visitors, the scala-lang link could be clearly labeled with its version (2.7.1), or the menu item could be hidden until a 2.7.3 vscaladoc resource is available online. (The adjacent scaladoc menu item links to a newer version of the docs.)

The vscaladoc and scaladoc links on the website menus are now labelled with the corresponding version. The vscaladoc link will be removed with the 2.8 release, which will use a completely new and updated scaladoc implementation.
