M4 is already a bit late, so we're planning to ship in the next few days once we have SAM support merged. M5 would be possible, though. 

I was never all that happy with my solution, it seemed very arbitrary.

Maybe this version would be a fraction less ugly.
```scala
  def check = parents exists (retry(_, tp2))
  if (tp.isGround)  check
  else suspendingTypeVars(typeVarsInType(tp))(check) else check
```
