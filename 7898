> I'm trying to figure out how to consider reachability per alternative, but that's tricky to describe in general. What if you have several nested alternatives (inside other patterns) in one case?

What deters you from expanding all the alternatives up front? This was something the old matcher did which I thought was approximately correct: copy patterns around until alternatives are gone.
