I have two files. In the first file a sealed type hierarchy is defined. The second file contains a match expression.

If the match expression in the second file is not exhaustive then the compiler outputs a warning. The text of the warning depends on whether the file containing the hierarchy is also in the compile set or not.

Steps to reproduce the behaviour:

1. Download the two files. Item.scala contains the hierarchy and Main.scala the match expression.

2. mkdir build

3. scalac -d build Main.scala Item.scala
=> the compiler outputs:
warning: match is not exhaustive!
missing combination UntypedAtomicValue

4. scalac -cp build -d build Main.scala
=> the compiler outputs:
match is not exhaustive!
missing combination IUntypedAtomicValue
missing combination UntypedAtomicValue
missing combination     IAttribute
missing combination          IText
