SLS 5.2 says:
```scala
Members of final classes or objects are implicitly also final,
so the final modifier is redundant for them, too.
```
However this is not true, as explained in SLS 4.1.
```scala
A constant value definition is of the form final val x = e where e is a constant expression (§6.24).
The final modifier must be present and no type annotation may be given.
References to the constant value x are themselves treated as constant expressions;
in the generated code they are replaced by the def- inition’s right-hand side e.
```
