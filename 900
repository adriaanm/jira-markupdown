I agree that performance may be more important for the actors framework than classloader or access control behaviour that works the same way as with Java threads.

I just think it is quite important that the behaviour of these aspects of the actors library are somehow specified and deterministic. The way it currently works can lead to bad surprises when you start an actor at an unfortunate place in your program.

Making it easier to extend the actors library with own classes also sounds like a great idea â€“ apart from the thread setup there are other places that would be interesting to adapt to application needs, for example the remote message transport system :-)
