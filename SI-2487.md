The following code causes an exception when compiling. The problem exists in 2.8.0.r19132 and 2.7.6.final. The example works if intsFrom is defined elsewhere. The exception trace is attached.

class C1(l: List[Int])

class C2 extends C1({
  def intsFrom(n: Int): Stream[Int] = Stream.cons(n, intsFrom(n+1))
  intsFrom(0).take(10).toList
})
Ah, the old define a recursive method in a block as part of a superconstructor argument trick.  Similar in some ways to SI-1909, in that it taxes the lifting abilities a bit too far.
Here's a simpler example which makes this fail:
{code}
class A(x: Int)

object B {
  def bar(n: => Int) = n
}

class B extends A ({
  def foo(n: => Int): Int = if (n == 0) 1 else B.bar(foo(n - 1))
  foo(10)
})
{code}
The problem is the recursive call to class foo in the anonymous class that's created
for bar's call by name parameter. To resolve that call lambda lift tries to find member `foo' of B. But since `foo' is defined in the constructor, it is not a member of `B'.

To my naive eye it looks like always lifting functions defined inside constructor or super calls into the companion object rather than the instance would solve this issue.  As I understand it, that was the solution to SI-1909.  If methods defined in these places can't reference "this" anyway since it doesn't exist yet, what is lost by making it static?
Closing as a duplicate of SI-6666 because it has a cooler number.
