"Your problem would have been solved if you used ConcreteTypeTags..."

Understand that I wasn't using anything.  I changed a method from using typetags to classtags - or so I thought.  (So I was trying NOT to use type tags.) The reason I use a typesafe language is so if I make a mistake like that, it will be caught by the compiler.  It doesn't help to give it a different name.

We have two things with similar, overlapping purposes, and if you put one where you mean the other, not only does everything still compile, but the manifestation of the problem is a million miles away.  Really, a VerifyError in the scala.reflect package object which silently freezes startup and which only happens under select circumstances is not how I want to find out about what should be a static typing error.
