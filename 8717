Andrew: It appears that the references from Scala Swing to {{scala.actor}} are really some historical hangover. I've created a ticket to either remove them or fix it's POM to declare a dependency.

Are you by any chance referring to {{scala.swing.SwingWorker}} in your code? I'd like to figure out specifically which class you're referring to that brings in this dependency.
