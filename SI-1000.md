It's not possible to end a raw string with a double quote :

scala> println("""This a "raw" string ending with a "double quote"""")
<console>:1: error: unterminated string
       println("""This a "raw" string ending with a "double quote"""")

I'm closing this wontfix unless someone wants to mount an argument to the contrary.  Triple quoted strings are specced to end on a triple quote, and that's what it's doing - special casing it to look for a quadruple quote and change its behavior is ugly at best.  It's also impossible to put a """ inside a triple quoted string.  Any quoting mechanism is going to have some edges, and the one in this ticket is very easy to work around:
{code}
scala> println("""This a "raw" string ending with a "double quote""" + "\"")
This a "raw" string ending with a "double quote"
{code}
Reopened to change status since martin just changed the parser.  You can now end a string with as many quotes as you want, which means you can put a triple quote in a triple quoted string, as long as you don't mind it being the last thing!
{code}
scala> val tquote = """""""""
tquote: java.lang.String = """
{code}
