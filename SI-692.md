If Streams are meant to be lazy lists, I'd expect the following to run in constant space:

```scala

This may or may not be related to #498, but here we are running out of heap space, not stack space.

> More importantly, this is evidence of a problem in the implementation - the head of the stream is not being allowed to be garbage collected. This basically means the socket example is unworkable because you'll retain all data ever read from it. This is sad, as this sort of lazy IO can often be really really handy. In general this will cause problems where the stream is potentially very large - the memory footprint will be much larger than it needs to be.

We are aware of the problem, and this has been discussed several times on the mailing list. I haven't thought about it long enough to be sure it's unsolvable, but here's a quick summary of why this is not easy to do:

{code}
for (i <- Stream.from(2)) f
{code} is translated to
```scala
Stream.from(2).foreach(f)
```
We'd like the GC to be able to collect memory while iterating through the stream, that means while inside `foreach`. That means the call stack contains `foreach`, `from(2)` and `main`, and `main` pushed a reference to the head of the stream before calling `from(2)`. That reference is a GC root. Additionally, each cell holds a reference to the value once it has been resolved (as each cell should be evaluated at most once). That leads to keeping everything in memory. I guess switching to a more functional design (in which these are not methods on Stream cells, but static methods) might help, but we'd lose for comprehensions.

We are open for suggestions. :)
Well, it's not that simple. Apparently, variables on the stack can still be GC roots. At least that's what JProfiler tells me. There's a very simple way to test this, simply replace Stream.foreach to

```scala
  override final def foreach(f: A => Unit) {
    if (isEmpty) {}
    else { f(head); tail.foreach(f) }
  }
```

Tail call optimization turns the last call into a jump, and replaces the 'this' by `tail`. This should be even better than nulling the 'this' :) Then, the following program has a single GC root for cons objects (according to JProfiler):

```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    var n = 0
    Stream.from(2).foreach { i =>
      n += 1
      if (n >= 5)
        while(true) {}
    }
  }
}
```

I'm not sure why (and maybe JProfiler is not the best tool...). I might be missing something obvious, but right now I don't see any other references to the first stream cell than the one inside the `main` method's stack, before calling `foreach`.
Additionally: are you sure TCO gets applied here? My tests show it not being. Here's some sample code to demonstrate:

```scala
package newstream;

abstract class Stream[+T]{
  def foreach(f : T => Unit) : Unit = if (empty) () else {f(head); tail.foreach(f)}
  def head : T;
  def tail : Stream[T];
  def empty : Boolean;
}

class Cons[+T](val head : T, _tail : => Stream[T]) extends Stream[T]{
  lazy val tail = _tail;
  def empty = false;
}

object Empty extends Stream[Nothing]{
  def head = error("Empty.head");
  def tail = error("Empty.tail");
  def empty = true;
}

object StreamTest extends Application{
  def from(i : Int) : Stream[Int] = new Cons[Int](i, from(i + 1));
  from(1).foreach(x => ());
}
```

This will stack overflow.

> I don't see why that's a problem. The Stream object on the stack won't be the original Stream.from(2), it will be the latest tail. Or am I missing your point?

It **is** the original (chaining through `tlVal` all stream values). I have no other point than what JProfiler shows in the heap walker. And the only reference to that one, is "Java stack".

That was exactly what I was trying to achieve, glad it works at least for some. I tried both my change (directly on `scala.Stream`) and your smaller example, both die with `OutOfMemory` after aprox. 15 seconds (java 1.5.0_13).

After another frustrating day, I have a bit more information about this issue: Your code runs fine, but the same change in `scala.Stream` does not (crashes with `OOM` even on Java 6). JProfiler insisted that the first cell was referenced from the Java stack.

It looks like it was actually about local variables (probably JProfiler can't distinguish them)! Turn your `Stream` into a `trait` and watch it die... The implementation of traits turns each method into a static method that takes an explicit `this` object, and a forwarder which calls it. The static method iterates over the stream, and keeps no references to it's visited cells, but the *forwarder* does! I think we should fix the compiler to null arguments before forwarding the call.

There was also a bug in tail call elimination causing a dead variable holding on to the 'this' instance with which the method was invoked (fixed in r14481). But that seems to be ok, as long as it happens inside a long running method (the real `foreach`), and fails when it's inside a forwarder (as mentioned in your link, short-running methods are a problem). We could either switch `Stream` to be an `abstract class` (checked that, and it works), or wait for a fix in the compiler.

I also changed `Stream.scala` to use tail recursion directly, instead of local `loop` functions (see r14480).

> I am facing the same problem as stated above, and it is really impossible to do further development as it is not allowing to create any more new Scala file. 

I don't understand. In what way is this bug stopping you from creating new Scala files?

> If u resolved the problem then please publish that so that other developer who is using Scala can use that.

Of course, that goes without saying. The status is as given above, and that means the current version is still leaking. Fixing it requires a compiler change that needs some more thinking. I'll put this on the agenda of the next Scala meeting.
There seems to be an edge case left. If you give the GC enough to work on,
everything looks fine. This seems to work in constant memory:

```scala
scala> var x = 0                                                                              
x: Int = 0

scala> def t(s: Stream[Int]) = s.map(_ => new Array[Int](10000000)).foreach(a => x = a.hashCode ^ x)         
t: (Stream[Int])Unit

scala> t(Stream.from(1))
```

But if you do not allocate enough, you run out of memory (this may be related to what David said above about the churn rate):

```scala
scala> var x = 0
x: Int = 0

scala> def t(s: Stream[Int]) = s.map(_ => new Array[Int](10)).foreach(a => x = a.hashCode ^ x)               
t: (Stream[Int])Unit

scala> t(Stream.from(1))
