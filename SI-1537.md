Compiling (2.7.2.final) and running the following code results in an unexpected MatchError. My impression is that something goes wrong with overriding the abstract `val syntax: Syntax` with `object syntax extends Syntax`.

```scala
trait Syntax {
  sealed trait Term 
  case object Foo extends Term
}

trait Evaluation {
  val syntax: Syntax
  import syntax._
  
  def eval(tm: Term): Term = tm match {
    case Foo => tm
  }
}

object EvalTest2 extends Evaluation with Application {
//  val syntax = new Syntax{}  // works
  object syntax extends Syntax // bug! --> eval(Foo) yields MatchError
  import syntax._
  
  eval(Foo)
}
```

With current trunk
  The code compiles but has ExceptionInInitializerError but not MatchError at runtime.
  The code after commenting the the line
    object syntax extends Syntax
  and uncommenting the line above it compiles and runs without any exception.

Nothing to do with pattern matching. Here's a match free version that demonstrates the problem:

```scala
trait Syntax {
  object Foo
}

trait Evaluation {
  val syntax: Syntax
  
  def equalInTrait = this.syntax.Foo == this.syntax.Foo
}

object EvalTest extends Evaluation with Application {
  object syntax extends Syntax 

  def equalInObject = this.syntax.Foo == this.syntax.Foo
  
  println(equalInTrait)
  println(equalInObject)
}
```

This prints false, then true. Or in other words when evaluated inside the trait, syntax.Foo != syntax.Foo. This is slightly bizarre, so it's not surprising the poor pattern matcher got confused...
Note that this is caused by #3932.
