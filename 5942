But how will lenny respond to this blatant attempt to exclude him?

Now I see how creates a class "off-by-two" bug (as this fails at both 21 and 22.) One takes this:
```scala
  args.length - 1 <= MaxFunctionArity
```
And cleverly turns it into this:
```scala
val len = args.length
len < MaxFunctionArity
```
Adding one and changing from <= to < must cancel each other out, right?

At least the perpetrator of this was nobly trying to make things faster by eliminating some of the many calls to list.length.  He deserves a medal, not your fencepost scorn.
