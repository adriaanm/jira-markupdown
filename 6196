r25128 contains a fix, but it might be just papering over. The problem is that a companion object Book comes back as NoSymbol after adaptation. The patch returns the type unchanged, but we should dig why adaptation failed. You can reproduce it by running the test pending/run/t4713 with -Ydebug. That shows you where the adaptation failure occurs.
