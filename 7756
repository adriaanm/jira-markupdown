You don't want to be warned when you write this?
```scala
if (() == ()) true else false
```
You must have some interesting use case in mind.  It's not exactly an "implementation detail" that the pattern matcher calls ==, it's the specification of what pattern matching is.  I certainly consider it a feature that it warns in this spot, and would consider it a bug if it did not. The unreachable code warning is born of exactly the same calculus: "this can't possibly be what you meant."
