It's true that the compiler only supports one output directory, but that could be changed, or the Eclipse builder could invoke the compiler more than once (it would be interesting to see if that's how it's done in the Java builder.

Either way, this seems like a reasonable feature request, and one we'd want to be on a par with the JDT, so I've reopened it as "Postponed" so that it doesn't get forgotten but there's also no commitment to any particular timetable.
