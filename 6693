That's pretty much my original suggestion (I used `notAnchored` instead of `unanchored`, but otherwise the same). The method on String was suggested to avoid compiling the pattern twice, as it happens with the [committed patch](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/1475df9bedc03417708f20d94b5e3db5c80f3036).
