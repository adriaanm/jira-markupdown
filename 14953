According to spec:

Multi-Line String Literals

Syntax:

stringLiteral ::= ‘"""’ multiLineChars ‘"""’

multiLineChars ::= {[’"’] [’"’] charNoDoubleQuote}

 

So if we see triple doublequotes in multiline string, then we should close it.

But this code compiles:
```scala
class A {

  val a = """"""" //seven doublequotes

}
```
