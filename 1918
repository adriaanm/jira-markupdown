As I commented on your post on scala-tools@, this is a known issue with Eclipse 3.4.x which will be fixed in 3.5.

For now, [http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_weaving_features this] workaround allows the Scala IDE to be installed in a read-only Eclipse instance (see the section "Installing JDT Weaving in a non-default location").
