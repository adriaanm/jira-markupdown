In:

    f"%"

error message is:

    percent signs not directly following splicees must be escaped

Since this was valid in 2.10.1, it will probably land on people migrating to 2.11 and compiling for the first time, so I suggest changing the message to

    percent signs not directly following splicees must be escaped as %%

to make the fix brainless.
