Consider the following code:
```scala
  class C(val a: Int)
  new C(a = 10, b = 15) // too many arguments for constructor C: (a: Int)
```
Here, it's easy to see that argument `b` is superfluous. However, if constructor has considerably more arguments (e.g. 10+), finding excessive arguments becomes a non-trivial task. Error message should provide the list of excessive arguments, as `not enough arguments` compiler error does.
