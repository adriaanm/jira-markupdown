In scala.collection.immutable.!MapProxy the text says:
"This is a simple wrapper class for scala.collection.*mutable*.Map."
but links to:
...nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/*immutable*/Map.html

I'm trying to investigate if it's supposed to be possible to create a !MapProxy with a immutable Map. #2939 describes the wall I'm hitting.
