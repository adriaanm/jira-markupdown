2.7.5 final
{code}
val arr= Array("a", "b", "c")
println(arr)
{code}

This prints something useless and not intuitive like [Ljava.lang.String;@6af2f0d0.
It would be great to make the default toString on arrays be informative.
Java created Arrays.toString as a work around for this but it's not a seamless solution (pain to use everytime and you need to know about the method in the first place)
That is fixed in current trunk, it prints a more informative message in 2.8:
{code}
scala> val arr= Array("a", "b", "c")
arr: Array[java.lang.String] = Array(a, b, c)
{code}
