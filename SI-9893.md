Scala 2.9:

```
scala> val m = collection.mutable.ListMap[Int, Int]()
m: scala.collection.mutable.ListMap[Int,Int] = Map()

scala> m += 1 -> 1
res0: m.type = Map(1 -> 1)

scala> m += 2 -> 2
res1: m.type = Map(2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)

scala> m += 3 -> 3
res2: m.type = Map(3 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)

scala> m += 4 -> 4
res3: m.type = Map(4 -> 4, 3 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)

scala> m += 5 -> 5
res4: m.type = Map(5 -> 5, 4 -> 4, 3 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)

scala> m -= 99
res5: m.type = Map(5 -> 5, 4 -> 4, 3 -> 3, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)

scala> m -= 3
res6: m.type = Map(5 -> 5, 4 -> 4, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)
```

but Scala 2.10.6 scrambles the order:

```
scala> val m = collection.mutable.ListMap[Int, Int]()
m: scala.collection.mutable.ListMap[Int,Int] = Map()

scala> m += 1 -> 1
res0: m.type = Map(1 -> 1)

scala> m += 2 -> 2
res1: m.type = Map(2 -> 2, 1 -> 1)

scala> m += 3 -> 3
res2: m.type = Map(3 -> 3, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2)

scala> m += 4 -> 4
res3: m.type = Map(4 -> 4, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1, 3 -> 3)

scala> m += 5 -> 5
res4: m.type = Map(5 -> 5, 3 -> 3, 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 4 -> 4)

scala> m -= 99
res5: m.type = Map(4 -> 4, 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1, 3 -> 3, 5 -> 5)

scala> m -= 3
res6: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5)
```

The intent that either ListMap should preserve insertion order wasn't explicit in the doc until https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4788 and https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4994, and there's some confusion at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7539924/why-do-mutable-and-immutable-listmaps-have-different-orders-in-scala and https://twitter.com/travisbrown/status/735201036873400321 about what the behavior should properly be.

But I think not preserving the order is just absurd. There's no downside to preserving. Also, note that http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/concrete-immutable-collection-classes.html#list_maps implies that the only reason to use a ListMap at all is if you care about the order.
There remains an issue of *what* order we want: are new items inserted at the back or the front?

mutable.ListMap is implemented as a very simple wrapper around scala.collection.immutable.List. As a natural consequence, new items are added to the front.

immutable.ListMap doesn't work that way — it's implemented on top of a private Node class. internally, it adds items on the front, but then it does `def iterator = ... .toList.reverseIterator` so the externally observable order is forwards. Note that this is expensive, as both `toList` and `reverseIterator` copy the whole collection.
So, what is to be done? There are different possibilities, and there are different considerations depending on whether a fix is targeting 2.11.x, 2.12.x, or 2.13.x.

in ascending order of ambitiousness, possibilities include:
- document the existing (gruesome) 2.10/2.11 behavior
- restore the 2.9 behavior (both kinds of ListMap preserve order, but in opposite directions) and document that
- choose a direction and make both kinds of ListMap preserve it, redoing the implementations if necessary

Note that wrapping immutable.List is a really terrible way to implement mutable.ListMap — tons of unnecessary copying.
ListMap and ListSet have basically zero reason to exist if they don't preserve insertion order.  Except there *isn't even a mutable.ListSet*.  I think this suggests that the mutable one should just be deprecated.  If you reeeeeally need the functionality of traversal-in-order, there is LinearHashMap/Set, and if you reeeeeeally need speed you should implement your own anyway.  In the meantime, before deprecation kicks in, insertion order is probably a good thing to preserve.  I have no strong feeling about which order.

For immutable.ListSet/Map, I think either order is okay as long as it is incredibly clear what the expectation is, and it is followed for every operation.  That is: head gives you the *most recent* item and iteration is *always* from recent to older; or head gives you the *oldest* item and iteration is *always* from recent to older.  And this property should be maintained through map, flatMap, etc. (which will mean using builders to create the underlying links because otherwise the order will switch every time you map).
I've noticed that `LinkedHashMap` works as expected, but it also (same as `mutable.ListMap`) seems to have 0 tests for ordering (https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/test/junit/scala/collection/mutable/LinkedHashMapTest.scala).


```java
scala> val m = collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap[Int, Int]()
m: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap[Int,Int] = Map()

scala> m += 1 -> 1
res42: m.type = Map(1 -> 1)

scala> m += 2 -> 2
res43: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2)

scala> m += 3 -> 3
res44: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3)

scala> m += 4 -> 4
res45: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4)

scala> m += 5 -> 5
res46: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5)

scala> m -= 99
res47: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5)

scala> m -= 3
res48: m.type = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5)
```
Just to add that I recently made some modifications to immutable.ListSet and immutable.ListMap in order to make them behave in a more consistent way. Initially I tried to to make the immutable.ListSet iterator provide the elements in reverse order for performance reasons, but I was forced to do the other way around as it seems the compiler depends on the current iteration order of ListSet for some things. That's the reason why `toList.reverseIterator` was kept there. The PR is https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5103.
