> But the scope of the named parameter should be limited to the method call, shouldn't it?

Yes. The issue is that the local value is also in scope, and Scala has to make a decision whether `payer = Some("payer")` is an assignment or usage of a named parameter.

The second one compiles, because a decision is not required in this case.
