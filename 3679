I used the scala ant task, which also crashed but printed an error message locating the problem.

From that I was able to narrow it down. The offending code is this

{code}
object Test {
   lazy val a = {
      lazy val b = 0
      b
   }
}
{code}
I've changed the summary of the ticket accordingly.
