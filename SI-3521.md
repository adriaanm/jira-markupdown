See this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2959311/can-i-have-a-negative-value-as-constant-expression-in-scala

Suppose you have a Java annotation:

{code}
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.FIELD)
public @interface DoubleValue {
  double value();
} 
{code}

Try to use it in Scala with a negative value:

{code}
class Test {
  @DoubleValue(-0.05)
  var a = 0
}
{code}

You get a strange error:

"annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: 0.05.unary_-"

Tested with Scala 2.8.0.RC3 on Sun Java 1.6.0_20

(In r22189) Taking another shot at negative constants as annotation arguments
since r22175 didn't quite get there.  I call into the constant folder
with the unfolded tree at the last point before it's going to fail
the compile anyway.  Closes SI-3521, review by odersky.
