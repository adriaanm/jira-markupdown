I understand the difference between utf 8 and modified utf 8. But, I'm not clear where exactly the mismatch happens in this scenario. (or where the bug - if any should be). Does scalac not support modified utf 8 encoding? I assume this is a compile time constant. If so, do scalac and javac generate different copies of the same constant? (Sorry if I'm missing something, I'm no expert on compiler internals.)
