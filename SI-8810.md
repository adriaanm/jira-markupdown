Input:

{code:scala}
/** 
 * This is an ordinary code block
 *
 * {{{
 * trait example {
 *   val x = 1
 *   val y = 2
 * }
 * }}}
 */
trait Foo
{code}

Expected output:
{code:scala}
trait example {
  val x = 1
  val y = 2
}
{code}

Output created by scaladoc:
{code:scala}
trait example {
val x = 1
val y = 2
}
{code}
The problem is with {{normalizeIndentation()}} in {{CommentFactoryBase}}.

I've simplified the code, fixed the issue and created test case for it: https://github.com/pawel-wiejacha/scala/commit/e84034d578c6201de49233a3965238feda2e0c14

I can create pull request if you wish.
That just happened to me!  I assumed it was a scaladoc thing.

Writing doc is so hard, there's nothing left over for tooling.

[~wiejacha]: Nice, that code is also much easier to read than the original! Yes, please open a PR for this against 2.11.x :)
