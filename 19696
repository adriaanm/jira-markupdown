This is a presentation compiler bug we have known for a really long time in the Scala IDE, but I just realised we have never opened a ticket here (despite talking about the issue with several members of the Scala team).

Basically, the presentation compilers fails to resolve symbols from source whose package declaration is not in sync with the source filesystem location.

{code:title=a/b/A.scala|borderStyle=solid}
package a // notice here it's `a` and not `a.b`

class A
{code}

{code:title=Foo.scala|borderStyle=solid}
object Foo {
  new a.A()
}
{code}

Typechecking source Foo.scala alone reports the following error

{noformat}
type A is not a member of package a
{noformat}

The problem goes away if source a/b/A.scala is also typechecked.

We have a number of tickets in the Scala IDE issue tracker that are linked to issue reported here, e.g., https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1001154
