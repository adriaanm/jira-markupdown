Paul: sorry to awaken you from that blissful p.*m.*-denial. Could you have a look please?

It looks like the body%1 generated for the 2nd leg/branch/case gets an empty parameter list (expected to have one param)

self-contained test (will commit to pending):
```scala
object Breakdown {
  def unapplySeq(x: Int): Some[List[String]] = Some(List("", "there")) 
}
object Test {
  42 match {
    case Breakdown("") =>  // needed to trigger bug
    case Breakdown("", who) => println ("hello " + who)
  }
}
```
