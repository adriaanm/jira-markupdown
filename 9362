Paul, Adriaan, thanks to you both for your comments. Not for the first time, it appears to be a much more complex issue than I had assumed. Maybe it's easier just to deprecate *null*? ;-) In any case, I'll be sure to follow-up your links: guaranteed non-null reference types would seem to be a natural fit with Scala and would sure make life easier for a lot of us.

Also, as for static checking, I should point out (for anyone interested) that [Scalastyle|http://www.scalastyle.org/] includes a test for the use of *null* - highly recommended!
