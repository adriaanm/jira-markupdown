I did some additional research, and after replacing occurrences of java.lang.Object with Object (note that these are generated files, so this is not necessarily a fix that will stick) I successfully compiled the project from ant, using 2.7.4rc1.

However, when I cleaned the project within Eclipse (this should delete all the class files, and then recompile them, but not cause a regeneration of the generated files), the bugs remained on the Eclipse side.

I tried this twice, and obtained a workspace that would build clean from ant, but after multiple cleans and refreshes within Eclipse, still failed in the way described above.

I therefore think that this bug is not yet resolved.  I am working on figuring out how to run 2.8.0 under ant, so that I may do an apples to apples comparison of command-line versus plugin.
