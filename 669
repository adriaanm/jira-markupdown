The right solution is to replace {{classes.jar}} in {{Settings.bootclasspath}} with a 1.4 version when targetting 1.4. Then building the scala library for 1.4 works, I tested it.

Right now, it's a bit messy because the "-bootclasspath" option contains the java AND the scala library, it doesn't allow to override only the java library.

I would propose to split the bootclasspath into "-javabootcp" and "-scalabootcp" - but this involves a change to the compiler options (and therefore to the ant tasks, script runner, ...)

Gilles, what do you think?
