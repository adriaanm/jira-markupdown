The code at the following paste url (http://paste.pocoo.org/show/106578/) causes scala repl to crash when invoked as per the session trace at the paste url (http://paste.pocoo.org/show/106581/).
This is a duplicate of SI-715, which I already updated with this code.  Also, please don't use pastebin references in bug reports, as they are ephemeral and trac will be here a long time.
