If you google scala-internals encodings you will see some long emails from me trying to improve this situation, with special emphasis on UTF-8 on the mac.  Most people were in favor of standardizing the default encoding, but martin and miles opposed.  I keep this alias around in the meantime:
{code}
alias utf8scala='JAVA_OPTS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" scala'
{code}
