I am trying to build Scala and SBaz from their respective trunks.  Scala seems to build fine.  SBaz initialized fine and I created a build.properties to correctly describe my context.  However:
```scala
build.main:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/Checkouts/Subversion/SBaz_Trunk/build/build.main
   [scalac] Compiling 77 source files to /home/Checkouts/Subversion/SBaz_Trunk/build/build.main
   [scalac] /home/Checkouts/Subversion/SBaz_Trunk/src/sbaz/SimpleUniverse.scala:27: error: reference to IOException is ambiguous;
   [scalac] it is imported twice in the same scope by
   [scalac] import scala.xml._
   [scalac] and import java.io._
   [scalac]       case _ => throw new IOException("unexpected response: " + response)
   [scalac]                           ^
   [scalac] one error found
```

The SBaz website seems to indicate to use this Trac but there is no SBaz component.
This is because the xml package object now defines an alias for IOException.
I think this is a bad idea, precisely because you can get these ambiguities.
That's why I'd remove:
```scala
  type IOException                  = java.io.IOException
  type UnsupportedEncodingException = java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException
  
  type URL                    = java.net.URL
  type MalformedURLException  = java.net.MalformedURLException
```
These are generally known classes, so the value of aliasing them is small, and the potential downside is large.

This is a release blocking bug, so I gave it high priority.

(In r21372) Tore out some unnecessary ambiguity-creating aliases in the
XML package object.  I have a feeling we'll be traversing this
kind of territory again.  Closes #3264, no review.
Thanks for sorting this out, sbaz now builds with the rebuilt scala.  There are a few warning left though:
```scala
