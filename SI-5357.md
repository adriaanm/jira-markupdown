This segment causes a compiler error:

trait M 

case class N() extends M {
  def mytest(x:M) =
  x match {
  case  A:N => 1
  case _ => 0
  }
}

the error is :6: error: '=>' expected but ':' found. case  A:N => 1

The code compiles and runs correctly if "A:N" is replaced by "a:N" or "<id>:N" where <id> is any identifier not beginning with an upper case letter. Same issue with REPL. 
I think I'll improve the error message though, if only to head off the next fifty people who think we'd overlook half the alphabet.
