Since the f-interpolator macro already processes format conversions, it's easy for it to handle custom conversions, that is, conversions supplementary to the underlying formatter.  This is an opportunity for a "%q" to stand for an escaped double quote, the way "%n" is taken for line ending.

POC:

Maybe it awaits a more compelling conversion.  Maybe %p for position, since people are often missing FILE and LINE.
