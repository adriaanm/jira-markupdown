Return of filterKeys is not serializable. I'm not sure this is intended behaviour or a bug, but it's possible to confuse users. Attached file throws following exception:

java.io.NotSerializableException: scala.collection.immutable.MapLike$$anon$1

filterKeys and mapValues basically return views that reference the original collection and a filter predicate instead of creating an entirely new collection. So it is no wonder they are not serializable. 

Fix #4776 by either returning a MapView or returning an entirely new Map, and the issue will solve itself.
This causes interesting bugs when using with Spark... 
Used  -Dsun.io.serialization.extendedDebugInfo=true and the way to here was short
Anything I can do to help? isn't this a simple fix? (I saw some pull requests... anything wrong with them?)
