I expected {{a zip b}} in the following snippet to return {{Option[(Int,Int)]}}

{code:scala}
scala> val a = Some(1)
a: Some[Int] = Some(1)

scala> val b = Some(2)
b: Some[Int] = Some(2)

scala> a zip b
res0: Iterable[(Int, Int)] = List((1,2))

{code}

This is not intuitive and even the docs state that it should have returned an {{Option}} (http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option).
