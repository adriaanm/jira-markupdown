Quoting myself in that thread:
```
This is in that category of things where we suffer inordinately, for
years in some cases, over things which can trivially be fixed.
Sometimes it's worth doing something just for the something, not for a
large universe of abstract somethings, and especially when trying for
the large universe of abstract somethings leads to an inferior
solution for the specific actual something everyone wanted back in
Concretia.
```
Sigh.
