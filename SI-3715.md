When I compile with jre 1.6.0_20 I get the attached stack overflow crash of the compiler.  With jre 1.5.0_22 this error does not occur and the compilation completes successfully.  This crash occurs in both 2.8.0 RC7 and 2.8.0.final.  It does not occur in 2.8.0 RC6 where both versions of the jre work fine for me.

I am running a large build with 100+ scala files, so I can't easily provide a simple test case, but if there is any additional information or a potential fix that I should try running I can do so.

(otherwise 2.8 is great! Thanks)
It's quite likely that you just need to increasing the stack size of scalac a little:

```scala
C:> SET ANT_OPTS=-Xss=2M
C:> ant build
```
