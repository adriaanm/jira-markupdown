Slight correction: this seems to occur only when the item on the next line has markup or there is markup at the end of the line.  Here is a better example (can't edit the ticket to update)
```scala

 /** Returns a $$some containing the result of
   * applying `pf` to this $$option's contained
   * value, *if*
   * this option is 
   * nonempty 
   * *and* `pf` is defined for that value. 
   * Returns $$none otherwise. 
```

This renders as:

> Returns a Some containing the result of applying pf to this Option 's contained value, ifthis option is nonemptyand pf is defined for that value. Returns None otherwise.

notice "ifthis" and "nonemptyand"; these should "if this" and "nonempty and"

The generated HTML is:
```scala
<p class="shortcomment cmt">Returns a <a href="Some.html" class="extype" name="scala.Some">Some</a>  containing the result of
applying <code>pf</code> to this <a href="" class="extype" name="scala.Option">Option</a> 's contained
value, <b>if</b>this option is
nonempty<b>and</b> <code>pf</code> is defined for that value.</p> 
```
