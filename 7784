I think the way Manifests got refactored was meant to preserve source back-compatibility. The ClassManifest inherits from ClassTag:
```scala
trait ClassManifest[T] extends OptManifest[T] with ClassTag[T] with Equals with Serializable
```

Apparently, something went wrong with this approach but I cannot see what.
