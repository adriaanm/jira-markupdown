Suggest renaming it `-Xlint:possible-missing-interpolator`.

scala/bug#6476 means `"""\$"""` does not unambiguously express escaped dollar.

For example, `file"""C:\Program Files\$name"""`.

The linter could be improved to check only possible interpolators. `-Xlint:possible-missing-possible-interpolator`

If the interpolator is a macro, it could check for success before warning; but failure (like a bad escape) could mean I haven't worked out the confusing syntax yet.

I asked about the linked issue on gitter recently and nobody cared. As with shoes, one cares only if they pinch, or if they're really great shoes.
