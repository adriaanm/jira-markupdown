The following error occurs on cygwin with 2.7.2.RC1 but didn't occur with earlier Scala releases. 

C:\> set | grep JAVA
JAVA_HOME=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0_05

C:\> bash

$ set | grep JAVA
JAVA_HOME='C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0_05'

$ scala -version
scala: line 65: C:/Program: No such file or directory
scala: line 65: exec: C:/Program: cannot execute: No such file or directory

A simple workaround might be to add quotes to the last line of scaladoc, scalac, scala, fsc:-
exec "${JAVACMD:=java}" ...

Thanks you for the fix.

> Can you confirm this?
I'm not noticing any problems when using symbols like '+' or ':' in the interpreter.
