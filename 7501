I came across:
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/f578ff88d2514bf94c46cfb8c0e33236c2b2fcf1
```
As a brief diversion from real work, implemented Damerau-Levenshtein
and ran it on trunk to elicit obvious misspellings. Unfortunately
they're mostly in places like compiler comments which real people never
see, but I fixed them anyway. All those English Lit majors who peruse
our sources are sure to be pleased.
```
As a Lit major, I really was pleased, but it would be even more cool to have
a tool that generated crossword puzzles from scaladoc, so that we could
learn stuff while having a bit of extraneous fun.
(Aside from the intrinsic fun of learning Scala.)
