The way the new plugin currently works, whenever you enter "case" within a match expression, the line is unindented two spaces.  Thus, it requires a remarkably high number of keystrokes to obtain the following format:

{code}
expr match {
  case 1 => ...
  case 2 => ...
}
{code}

Is there any way this "feature" could be disabled?  Or, even better, made an option?
We need to agree on whether we want C-style case indentation (going all the way back to goto label indentation as specified in the 70s, currently implemented) or something non-standard (suggested by the submitter). Of course, when it comes to indentation, everyone is religious. If you want to hack the plugin to make this configurable, I'm happy to accept the patch. But what is default should be decided by someone else. 

Re-indentation occurs because case is overloaded to mean case class or case object, so we don't know the indent until the user types the next token after case.

I changed the case indent to be what the user wants. We can't disable re-indent because indent of a line is not known until the first one or two tokens is known. e.g.,

{{x match {
  case =>
    cas}}

After you type "e" the case token will snap back to be indented correctly.
