I don't think its a compiler problem. I think the plugin is not resolving the *eclipse* classpath variable (ie, M2_REPO) before providing the jars to compiler.

Oh, wait, you are saying that even though the plugin has bug, the compiler also has a bug because it should not crash due to a specified jar that it cannot find on disk. Ok, I'll try to build a command line failing test. (So far I've only been working within the IDE... but I gotta learn this at some point)

I've read all(?) the posts on scala-tools wrt to running tests. The effort and level of support is really not worth it for me given that Idea has explicit support for running ScalaTests without any hacks, displays the results in the built in test runner, allows for re-running a single test, etc. This kind of test support will be a prereq for me to use eclipse on a regular basis. In the meantime I will continue to test out compilation, navigation, and such in eclipse until it catches up with idea in test support.

Thanks!!
