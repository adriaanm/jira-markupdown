I am using Fedora 10's version of Eclipse which is installed as an rpm package. All I had to do was run Eclipse as root and install the scala plugin as root then it was available to me under my user account and functions properly. Other plugins have no problem being installed as a user but the scala plugin won't install properly. 
As I commented on your post on scala-tools@, this is a known issue with Eclipse 3.4.x which will be fixed in 3.5.

For now, [http://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_weaving_features this] workaround allows the Scala IDE to be installed in a read-only Eclipse instance (see the section "Installing JDT Weaving in a non-default location").
