For all functions {{f}} and {{g}},
{code}Success(a) map { f compose g }{code}
should produce the same result as
{code}Success(a) map g map f{code}

However, in the following example:
{code}
def divideByZero(a: Int): Int = a / 0
def numberOrDefault(a: => Int): Int =
  try a catch { case _: ArithmeticException => 42 }
{code}
the property we want is not satisfied:
{code}
Success(1) map { numberOrDefault compose divideByZero } === Success(42)
Success(1) map divideByZero map NumberOrDefault === Failure(ArithmeticException)
{code}

In order to satisfy the functor composition law in the above case, we need something like the following implementation for {{Failure.map}}:
{code}def map[U](f: T => U): Try[U] = Try[U](f(throw exception)){code}

This allows the possibility of going from a {{Failure}} to a {{Success}}, which is correct if {{Try}} is attempting to mimic the semantics of exception handling.

*EDIT:* The same can be said for {{Failure.flatMap}}, by the way. It should also be possible for the function passed to {{flatMap}} to catch the contained exception and produce a {{Success}}, as above.
This is only true for the category of types and functions.   If you limit your category to that of types and functions (arrows) that do not catch nonfatal exceptions, then there is no issue.   Since try is reifying exception handling, this is not an unreasonable assertion to make.


{quote}Since try is reifying exception handling, this is not an unreasonable assertion to make.{quote}

In the case of {{flatMap}}, I'd probably buy that argument. That is, when you have {{f: A => Try\[B\]}} it's probably reasonable to assume that whoever wrote {{f}} knows how {{Try}} is supposed to work! But there are two problems:

# If that were the case, then the implementation of {{Success.flatMap}} should simply be {{f(value)}}, right? No need to {{try/catch}}, since {{f}} presumably won't throw a non-fatal exception.
# More importantly, I think in the case of {{map}} that your assertion doesn't fly. That is, you can't assume the author of some arbitrary, pre-existing {{f: A => B}} will have foreknowledge that their function will be lifted into the {{Try}} functor, nor is it safe to assume that the consumer of {{f}} can see its implementation. If you're writing all the code yourself, no problem, but you know how that goes...

I think this comment and the discussion should be directed to the SIP 14 mailing list (scala-sips@googlegroups.com). It's a design decision, not a bug.

The example above doesn't compile on scala 2.10-M6.

Success(1) map { numberOrDefault compose divideByZero }
<console>:13: error: missing arguments for method numberOrDefault;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
              Success(1) map { numberOrDefault compose divideByZero }


The code is broken, and if you fix it, you will see that Try is actually a valid functor.
Here are two possible ways to fix it:
1. http://ideone.com/Z21SUn
{code:scala}
import scala.util._

object Main extends App {
  def divideByZero(a: Int): Int = a / 0
  def numberOrDefault(a: Int): Int =
    try a catch { case _: ArithmeticException => 42 }
    
  println(Success(1) map { numberOrDefault _ compose divideByZero _ })
  println(Success(1) map divideByZero _ map numberOrDefault _)
}
{code}
2. http://ideone.com/Z9zePL
{code:scala}
import scala.util._

object Main extends App {
  def divideByZero(a: Int): Int = a / 0
  def numberOrDefault(a: => Int): Int =
    try a catch { case _: ArithmeticException => 42 }
    
  println(Success(1) map { ((x: Int) => numberOrDefault(x)) compose divideByZero _ })
  println(Success(1) map divideByZero _ map ((x: Int) => numberOrDefault(x)))
}
{code}
You may argue this is the right example: http://ideone.com/TgkLCO
{code:scala}
import scala.util._

object Main extends App {
  def divideByZero(a: Int): Int = a / 0
  def numberOrDefault(a: => Int): Int =
    try a catch { case _: ArithmeticException => 42 }
    
  println(Success(1) map { x => numberOrDefault(divideByZero(x)) })
  println(Success(1) map divideByZero _ map ((x: Int) => numberOrDefault(x)))
}
{code}
But that's not true, because for "map (f . g)" case you use
{code}
f = numberOrDefault
g = divideByZero
{code}
and for "map g . map f" case you use another f:
{code}
f = ((x: Int) => numberOrDefault(x))
g = divideByZero
{code}
By this example you actually prove that numberOrDefault !== ((x: Int) => numberOrDefault( x )), which is quite obvious fact.
there are a number of mistakes you are making here i think. 

first of all, the so-called composition you are making is bogus. `numberOrDefault` is actually taking a closure, and composing `divideByZero` actually means to capture it inside of a closure, instead of the expression itself. composition law of functor doesn't specify this situation at all. that is

{code}
tryy map { p => g(() => f(p)) }
{code}

doesn't have any assumption of relation to

{code}
tryy map f map g
{code}

but rather should be equivalent to

{code}
tryy map { p => () => f(p) } map g
{code}

don't let syntax trick you.

also, another problem is Try is not a valid point of discussion anyways. Try handles side effects and expects ones. it's ok to not have this class escape from the laws.
