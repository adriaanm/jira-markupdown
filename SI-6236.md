That entry seems to have slain the compiler.  Shall I replay
your session? I can re-run each line except the last one.

It's unrelated to the repl.  Just nest like the repl does.
```scala
// a.scala
package p {
  object x {
    object x {
      @scala.annotation.static val foo: Int = 353
    }
  }
}
// b.scala - separately compiled
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(p.x.x.foo)
  }
}
```
Apparently, the first compilation creates a classfile for `p.x.x` which has a static field `foo`:

```scala
Compiled from "file_1.scala"
public class p.x$x extends java.lang.Object
  SourceFile: "file_1.scala"
  Scala: length = 0x
   
...

const #20 = Asciz	SourceFile;
const #21 = Asciz	Scala;

{
public static int foo;

...

}

```

During the second compilation, during icode, members of `p.x.x` are missing `foo`:

```scala
Scope{
  def <init>(): p.y$x;
  final def $asInstanceOf[T0 >: ? <: ?](): T0;
  final def $isInstanceOf[T0 >: ? <: ?](): Boolean;
  final def synchronized(x$1: Object): Object;
  final def ##(): Int;
  final def !=(x$1: Object): Boolean;
  final def ==(x$1: Object): Boolean;
  final def ne(x$1: Object): Boolean;
  final def eq(x$1: Object): Boolean;
  protected[package lang] def finalize(): Unit;
  final def wait(): Unit;
  final def wait(x$1: Long,x$2: Int): Unit;
  final def wait(x$1: Long): Unit;
  final def notifyAll(): Unit;
  final def notify(): Unit;
  def toString(): String;
  protected[package lang] def clone(): Object;
  def equals(x$1: Object): Boolean;
  def hashCode(): Int;
  final def getClass(): Class;
  def <init>(): Object
}
```
When reading from bytecode, and when reading from java source, statics are mapped into the (possibly synthetic) companion object of the class being read. So although there is bytecode for p$x$x with a static field in it, the scala class p.x.x does not have it; the object p.x.x does.

If I change this:

  val hostClass = qual.tpe.typeSymbol.orElse(sym.owner).companionClass

Not to call companionClass, then it finds the field foo and stops crashing.  Of course then it fails at runtime with "java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: foo" because the confusion surrounding this is not so nicely localized.
Ah, of course - a static field won't be in the list of members of the class. Thanks for pointing this out.

I still call the `companionClass` in 1138, I just moved it to the next line.
