scala> val a = Float.NaN
a: Float = NaN

scala> a == Float.NaN
res0: Boolean = false

scala> a equals Float.NaN
res1: Boolean = true

scala> val b = Double.NaN
b: Double = NaN

scala> b == Double.NaN
res2: Boolean = false

scala> val c = Float.NaN
c: Float = NaN

scala> a == c
res3: Boolean = false

scala> a equals c
res4: Boolean = true
```
In Java, a == Float.NaN should return false, that's right, but in Scala, according to Programming In Scala, Page 567:
"Scala treats == as if it was deﬁned as follows in class Any
```scala
final def == (that: Any): Boolean = 
  if (null eq this) {null eq that} else {this equals that}
```
"

Thus, if "a.equals(Float.NaN)" returns true, then "a == Float.NaN" should also return true. That's why I filed this ticket.
Things move fast in equalityland, PiS is lagging a ways back.  (Not saying it's incorrect, I can't tell without context.) You'll need to cite the spec on something like this, not a book.  What that line doesn't mention is that == is also overloaded on all the primitive types, so Float == Float does not call the == method on Any.  == is comparing primitives and equals is comparing boxes, and the already shaky correspondence between these is going away any day now if my sources can be believed.

```scala
scala> java.lang.Float.NaN == java.lang.Float.NaN    
res0: Boolean = false

scala> java.lang.Float.NaN equals java.lang.Float.NaN
res1: Boolean = true
```

Soon the above will be but a detail, since == will be doing this:
```scala
scala> 0 == 0L
res0: Boolean = true

scala> (0: Any) == (0L: Any)
res1: Boolean = false
```
As an addendum, the `==` equality cannot return true in any case, as that would invalidate IEEE-754 floating point semantics. That would make the language virtually unusable (incompatible with 754) for scientific computations, so that's a non-option in any case.

Either `Float.equals` needs to return false, which would put it at odds with Java, or `==` and `equals` have to be different. As Paul mentioned, the latter is the current choice.
