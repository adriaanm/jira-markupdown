(In r21230) Noticed we still have a bunch of collection classes which
are rather lacking.  Did some integration, added some companion
objects.  Not thrilled with the overall picture in there,
there's still a lot which should be done.  Updated a deprecation
message, closes scala/bug#3202.  No review.
