When I download a new version of scala, it is hard to fix the version
that M-x run-scala uses. That is because scala-default-interpreter is
defined with defcustom, but  scala-interpreter is not. So, if
scala-interpreter is already defined, you have to use M-x customize-variable to change scala-default-interpreter, then either restart Emacs or use M-x set-variable to change scala-interperter. 

It would be much easier if you eliminate scala-default-interpreter completely,
and define scala-interperter with defcustom instead.

See attached patch.

Sorry, this is not Eclipse plugin; it is the emacs mode inferior-scala-mode.el
but there is no Trac component for that.
