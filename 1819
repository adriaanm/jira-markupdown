Right, so this is a known proble (largely fixed on trunk). The Java presentation compiler (which is responsible for the annotations you're seeing) isn't always aware of Scala constructs and hence give spurious reports. The Java build compiler, on the other hand, is quite happy so your build is successful and there are no problems listed in the Eclipse Problems view.

The workaround is to pay attention only to errors in Java source referencing Scala if there is a corresponding problem listed in the Problem view.

Aside from this, are you able to export your project?
