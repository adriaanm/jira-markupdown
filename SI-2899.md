I have a function that accepts a buffer, which is an Array[Byte].  I want callers to be able to specify a buffer to use, or have the function create one if the caller hasn't provided it.  No problem:

```scala
def copy(in: InputStream, out: OutputStream, buffer: Array[Byte] = new Array[Byte](1024))
```

Works fine, but shouldn't Scala be able to figure out that buffer has the type Array[Byte] without my having to specify it?  It works elsewhere:

```scala
val buffer = new Array[Byte](1024)
```

But this does not work:

```scala
def copy(in: InputStream, out: OutputStream, buffer = new Array[Byte](1024))
```
