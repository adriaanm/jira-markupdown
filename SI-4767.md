Expected behavior would be inlining {{foo}} into {{bar}}. It all works if you change {{Foo}} to be a class instead of a trait.


I did some digging around and apparently ICode reading does not resolve methods bodies in traits:
{code}
scala> global.icodes.icode(global.definitions.getClass("scala.collection.immutable.MapLike"),true).methods.map(_.code)
res0: List[global.icodes.global.icodes.Code] = List(null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, ICode 'companion', null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, ...
{code}

Furthermore, it looks like class file reading will *never* load a trait's impl class (which actually contains the method bodies):
{code}
scala> global.definitions.getClass("scala.collection.immutable.MapLike")
res2: global.Symbol = trait MapLike

scala> res2.implClass
res3: global.Symbol = <none>
{code}
There's really no way to get at it:
{code}
scala> global.definitions.getClass("scala.collection.immutable.MapLike$class")
scala.reflect.internal.MissingRequirementError: class scala.collection.immutable.MapLike$class not found.
	at scala.reflect.internal.Definitions$definitions$.getModuleOrClass(Definitions.scala:662)
	at scala.reflect.internal.Definitions$definitions$.getClass(Definitions.scala:615)
{code}


The reason is that {{ClassPath.scala}} explicitly excludes these class files (ending in {{$class.class}}):
{code}
/** A useful name filter. */
def isTraitImplementation(name: String) = name endsWith "$class.class"
...
object DefaultJavaContext extends JavaContext {
  override def isValidName(name: String) = !isTraitImplementation(name)
}
{code}
I believe this is a bug on its own - commenting out {{isValidName}} fixes the {{implClass}} behavior but not the inlining issue altogether.
That filter is only in place if inlining isn't on.  I don't have a good explanation for what seems like an unreasonable amount of indirection, but you can see it in the PathResolver constructor. 

{code}
class PathResolver(settings: Settings, context: JavaContext) {
  def this(settings: Settings) = this(settings, if (settings.inline.value) new JavaContext else DefaultJavaContext)
{code}

{noformat}
% scala3 -Yinline

scala> global.definitions.getClass("scala.collection.immutable.MapLike$class")
res0: global.Symbol = class MapLike$class
{noformat}
Sorry about the confusion, the correct signature is {{def bar(y: Foo): Unit}} (fixed above). I didn't follow up all the way to the check in {{PathResolver}}, I guess you're right about that. Not sure whether {{implClass}} always returning {{NoSymbol}} is a problem in other circumstances.
I've got a handle on what's happening; I can't see how this was ever close to working.  When looking up method implementations for inlining, it only looks at base classes.  It needs to make the "lateral" jump to the implementation class to find anything worth inlining.  I'm not sure if it's finding the forwarder method, but it doesn't seem interested in inlining it if it is.  I hacked more logic into the inliner and eventually got to the point where the trait-defined method with implementation in Foo$class would be inlined; but then it fell apart because it has the wrong signature (i.e. the receiver is the first argument to a static method.)

So before I continue any more down this road, since it feels like rather a lot of "original research" for something I had thought was closer to working order, I thought I'd ask for a sanity check.

Inlining the forwarder method could be sufficient: since the forwarder contains an explicit call of the implementation method wouldn't that be dealt with transitively?

However it seems like {{lookupIMethod}} would need to do the same thing as {{lookupImplFor}}, namely look at {{overridingSymbol}} while walking up the inheritance chain. 

Also, {{lookupImplFor}} aborts the traversal if {{sym.owner.isTrait}}. I'm not sure about the reasoning behind that check.

I may be missing something (a lot, possibly) but to me it looks like the lookup logic could be simplified into something like this:
{code}
      // look up methSym for a receiver instance of classSym:
      var actualClass = classSym
      var actualMeth = methSym
      while (actualMeth.owner != actualClass) {
        val ov = actualMeth.overridingSymbol(actualClass)
        if (ov != NoSymbol) {
          actualMeth = ov
          assert(actualMeth.owner == actualClass)
        } else {
          actualClass = actualClass.superClass
        }
      }
      val iclass = icodes.icode(actualClass,true)
      val imethod = iclass.lookupMethod(actualMeth)
{code}
In a trait, the methods are abstract and they have no code.  That's presumably why lookupImplFor aborts, and that's also how I ended up hacking in the implementation class the last time around.

GenICode:
{code}
      case DefDef(mods, name, tparams, vparamss, tpt, rhs) =>
        debuglog("Entering method " + name)
        val m = new IMethod(tree.symbol)
        ...
        if (!m.isAbstractMethod && !m.native) {
          // stuff which leads to m.code being populated
        }
        else
          ctx1.method.setCode(null)
{code}
I'll look around some more.

I'm upping this to critical because I believe this is, well, critical.
I was looking a bit into the bytecode generated from PatternMatching.scala and was horrified to see none of my methods were being inlined.

Thanks, yes, I know about the workaround, but I do believe this ticket should still be fixed ASAP.

By popular demand here's a draft version of the not-so-minor changes to Inliner this ticket requires: 
https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/scala:2.10.x...magarciaEPFL:SI-4767-b

Still needs to be tested with the nightly. It would be great if [~grek] could gather data on its performance effect.
Discussion on fixing ICodeReader at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/w_ySCPJRmvg/discussion

To get a handle on this problem, I've implemented a fix in the experimental optimizer http://magarciaepfl.github.com/scala/

As a result:

- all callsites to final methods of traits are emitted as invokestatic
- of the above, those methods additionally marked @inline are inlined too

In the example

{code}
trait T {
  @inline final def m(x: Int) {
    println(x)
  }
}
class C {
  def host(y: T) {
    y.m(7)
  }
}

{code}


The resulting bytecode for {{host()}} is:

{code}
public void host(T);
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=3, Args_size=2
   0:	bipush	7
   2:	istore_2
   3:	getstatic	#15; //Field scala/Predef$.MODULE$:Lscala/Predef$;
   6:	iload_2
   7:	invokestatic	#21; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
   10:	invokevirtual	#25; //Method scala/Predef$.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
   13:	return
{code}

Without the @inline annotation, the bytecode for {{host()}} looks like:

{code}
public void host(T);
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=2
   0:	aload_1
   1:	bipush	7
   3:	invokestatic	#15; //Method T$class.m:(LT;I)V
   6:	return
{code}


With the current optimizer as we know the callsite to {{T.m(Int)}} is emitted as:

{code}
   3:	invokeinterface	#15,  2; //InterfaceMethod T.m:(I)V
{code}

Here's how the new optimizer supports inlining of trait methods, documentation included:

https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/commit/dbf85bfef19e285daa191875338b70f0b64dc20e


Yes!, [~rytz] has fixed this in the experimental backend ("-Ybackend:GenBCode -Yopt:l:classpath") in Scala 2.11.7. This backend will be on by default in Scala 2.12.
