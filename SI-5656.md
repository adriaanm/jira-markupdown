```scala
println(Seq(Array('1','2','3'), Array('a','b','c')).view.addString(new StringBuilder, "_"))
```

I expect it print "123_abc", but I got "...".
OK, since I don't whether that is true, reopening and assigning to reviewer.
I'm unsure why `addString` was overridden in `ViewMkString` to add `...`.
It does not seem consistent with the fact that `mkString` *does* force the view contents.

I would say that `addString` should force the view, just like `mkString`.
