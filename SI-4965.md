I tested :implicits command in REPL.
but it seems not work.
it can't find implicit i write.

```scala
scala> :implicits
No implicits have been imported other than those in Predef.

scala> class Converter(n: Int) {
     |   def hour = { n + " hours" }
     | }
defined class Converter

scala> implicit def converter(n: Int) = new Converter(n)
converter: (n: Int)Converter

scala> :implicits
No implicits have been imported other than those in Predef.

scala> 3 hour
res0: String = 3 hours
```

I did something wrong?
