Currently, compiling code with deeply nested anonymous functions(for instance, large for comprehensions), can generate code with extremely long class filenames, approaching the limit. The current limit of 254 is long enough that it breaks compilation on various types of nested filesystems, particualrly ecryptfs and aufs. 

This is particularly problematic since docker often uses AUFS, and many folks try to run their CI infrastructure on docker.

My understanding is that the new java lambda support will alleviate many of these cases, but it seems like it would be good to close the door on this issue once and for all as well. Given Scala 2.12 should be breaking binary compatibility anyway, it seems like it would be a good time to move the limit down to something safer, perhaps 240?
duplicate of #3623. I would suggest adding your commentary there.
