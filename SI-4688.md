Exiting the REPL interpreter renders the terminal unusable.  Observe:

jim@DELL:~$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_24).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :quit
jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ 

No matter how I exit the interpreter, I can no longer use the terminal.  If I try to type something in the terminal after I exit, nothing appears on the screen.  Hitting enter results in a new prompt, but on the same line as the previous one.  It is as if the newline character no longer operates.  However, I can start the scala REPL again and everything will be fine.
You are right, reset fixes the problem.  Furthermore, I did some investigation and discovered the problem is being caused by something goofy I did when I installed the script and jar files onto my machine, and that scala run from the tar file downloaded from the website does not have the problem.

I will close this out.  I apologize for wasting your time.
The bin/scala run script in the scala-lang download package takes care to reset the TTY on exit, using a trap.

In Ubuntu at least, the shell script does **not** do this. So yes, it's a downstream issue.
Noting for posterity that this has been fixed in the [downstream Ubuntu package for Xenial](http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/scala), which can be applied fairly easily to older releases e.g. Trusty.  So you can now even use a heredoc with scala REPL without too much annoyance.

I couldn't locate the bug-report, but this was broken in `2.9.2+dfsg-2` and working in `scala_2.11.6-6_all`.  In the broken version, blindly typing `stty sane` brings back a reasonable tty.
