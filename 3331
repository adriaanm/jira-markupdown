The code above also complains that Publisher takes 2 type arguments. When provided with `MyPublisher` as the second type argument, it complains `notify` method is not implemented in `MySubscriber`.

{code}

import scala.collection.mutable.Publisher
import scala.collection.mutable.Subscriber


object PubSub {
  class Event

  class MyPublisher extends Publisher[Event, MyPublisher] {
  }
  
  class MySubscriber( val p: MyPublisher ) extends Subscriber[Event,MyPublisher] {
    def notify(pub: MyPublisher, event: Event): Unit {}
  }

}

{code}
