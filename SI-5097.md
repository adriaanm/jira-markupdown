Dependent on SI-5096, this diff switches from "new PartialFunction" or "extends PartialFunction" on concrete classes to make use of AbstractPartialFunction, trimming a modest amount of classfile space.
(extempore in [r25854|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25854]) AbstractPartialFunction.

Contributed by Todd Vierling with minor mods by extempore. This is an
obvious extension of AbstractFunctionN which I had some issue making
work at the time. Sounds kind of pitiful given that the compiler patch
is about two lines, but let's all agree to believe it was a different
world then.

This example program is impacted as follows:

    class A {
      def f: PartialFunction[Any, Int] = { case x: String => 1 }
      def g: PartialFunction[Any, Int] = f orElse { case x: List[_] => 2 }
      def h: PartialFunction[Any, Int] = g orElse { case x: Set[_] => 3 }
    }

Before: 34943 bytes of bytecode
 After:  4217 bytes of bytecode

A mere 88% reduction in size. "'Tis but a trifle!" Closes SI-5096, SI-5097.
