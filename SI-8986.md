```scala
scala> import scala.language.postfixOps
import scala.language.postfixOps

scala> case class Foo (i:Int, j:Int)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo.apply _ tupled
res2: ((Int, Int)) => Foo = <function1>
```

I would expect that res2's type  is  (Product2) => Foo

I'm happy to produce a patch assuming it's agreed that this behaviour is incorrect.
If we make this change, we would also need to touch the corresponding `Function.tupled` methods.

Changes of this nature, however, usually have subtle source incompatibilities.

This is contrived, but shows how in the presence of type inference, this seemingly compatible change could break someones code:

```scala
scala> def tupled[A, B, C](f: (A, B) => C): (Product2[A, B] => C) = ???
tupled: [A, B, C](f: (A, B) => C)Product2[A,B] => C

scala> def client(f: (Int, Int) => Int) = Set[((Int, Int)) => Int](tupled(f))
client: (f: (Int, Int) => Int)scala.collection.immutable.Set[((Int, Int)) => Int]

scala> def client(f: (Int, Int) => Int): Set[((Int, Int)) => Int] = {val result = Set(f.tupled); result}
client: (f: (Int, Int) => Int)Set[((Int, Int)) => Int]

scala> def client(f: (Int, Int) => Int): Set[((Int, Int)) => Int] = {val result = Set(tupled(f)); result}
<console>:34: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.immutable.Set[Product2[Int,Int] => Int]
 required: Set[((Int, Int)) => Int]
Note: Product2[Int,Int] => Int <: ((Int, Int)) => Int, but trait Set is invariant in type A.
You may wish to investigate a wildcard type such as `_ <: ((Int, Int)) => Int`. (SLS 3.2.10)
       def client(f: (Int, Int) => Int): Set[((Int, Int)) => Int] = {val result = Set(tupled(f)); result}
                                                                                                  ^
```

I'll assign this Rex for his opinion.
#1799 (Case classes should inherit from ProductN) might be relevant.
