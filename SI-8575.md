This code throws an java.lang.AbstractMethodError: 
{code}
  class E[F]
  class A
  class B
  class C

  trait Intf {
    type R
    type RR

    def f1(r: R) {
      val rr = f2(r)
      f3(rr) // This call throws an AbstractMethodError
    }

    def f2(r: R): RR
    def f3(r: RR)
  }

  class Impl extends Intf {
    type F = A with B
    type R = E[F]
    type RR = E[F with C]
    // works if I replace by:
    //type RR = E[A with B with C]

    override def f2(r: R): RR = new E[F with C]()
    override def f3(rr: RR) { println("This should be printed")}
  }

  new Impl().f1(new E[A with B]())
{code}
Added a byte code comparison the with working version (where the type alias is manually dealiased to {{E\[A with B with C\]}}) to https://gist.github.com/b-studios/e06f741434b2119ed0f2

The main difference is that the following method implementation is generated for the working version, while it isn't for the version with {{E\[F with C\]}}:

{code}
public java.lang.Object id(java.lang.Object);
  Code:
     0: aload_0       
     1: aload_1       
     2: checkcast     #27                 // class E
     5: invokevirtual #29                 // Method id:(LE;)LE;
     8: areturn 
{code}
