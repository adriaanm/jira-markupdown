There was a time when the following code would have prompted a warning "match is not exhaustive!" and fail compiling:

{code}
sealed abstract class Tree
case class Node(l: Tree, v: Int, r: Tree) extends Tree
case object EmptyTree extends Tree


(EmptyTree: Tree) match {
    case Node(_,v,_) if (v == 0) => 0
    case EmptyTree => 2
}
{code}

I tested it with all previous scalac release up to 2.5.0 and it doesn't work for any of them. I believe that with 2.4.0 was working.
