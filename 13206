If I have two packages with the same final element then I get errors when attempting to reference classes across the packages.  Best illustrated with an example.

In file a/TestClass.scala I have the following:
{code}
package a
class TestClass
{code}

In file foo/a/TestClass2.scala I have the following:
{code}
package foo.a
import a.TestClass
class TestClassB
{code}

Produces the error

{{error: TestClassA is not a member of a}}

This is a consistent error regardless of what the last path element in the package name is.
