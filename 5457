(In r24270) I chased a lot of ghosts before finding the real culprit
for why partest failures have been unfailing.

  Process(Seq("bash", "-c", "exit 42")) !             // 42
  Process(Seq("bash", "-c", "exit 42")) #> logFile !  // 0

That behavior is not yet fixed, but I altered partest not
to use #> and fixed the test which should have been failing
but wasn't.  Closes scala/bug#4227, no review.
