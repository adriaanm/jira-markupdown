Scala 2.9.2

I was trying to spawn a scala shell in my code for debugging purposes. I tried with the following snippet of code, but the debug> shell that I get hangs after the first command. See the output below.

{code}
import scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.ILoop._
import scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.NamedParam

object TestDebugger {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    0 to 10 foreach { i =>
      breakIf(i == 5, NamedParam("i", i))
      println(i)
    }
  }
}
{code}

{noformat}
$ scala /tmp/test.scala 
0
1
2
3
4
Debug repl starting.  Binding 1 value.
i: Int = 5

debug> i
(it doesn't accept any input + it doesn't terminate)
{noformat}

any help is appreciated. thanks.
cheers,
Yanick
{{break}} / {{breakIf}} were removed altogether in 2.10.

So we'll have to close this one as "out of scope".
