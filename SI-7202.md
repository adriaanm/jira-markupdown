Our way to expand private names by appending to fully qualified owner is not discriminating enough. Consider:
```scala
object nesting {
  class C {
  
    class D {
      private def x = "D"
      def show = x
      class E {
    	println(x)
      }
    }
    
    val foo: D = {
      class D extends C.this.D {
        private def x = "foo.D"
    	class E {
    	  println(x)
    	}
      }
      new D
    }
  }
  val c = new C
  val d = c.foo
  d.show
}
```
This should print "D" but prints "Foo.D". The problem lies in fullName which only retains the names of enclosing classes, and drops all enclosing values. 

I believe we can fix the problem by leaving some trace that there is an enclosing term in the full name. It could be as simple as an extra dot in the full name. I.e. right now the full name of the class D in foo is nesting.C.D. If it was nesting.C..D or nesting.C._.D instead the clash would be avoided. 
This example also illustrated unsoundness in the type system (#7278) so the revised code, in addition to printing something unexpected, should not exploit that issue.
This issue is really different from #7278. Here class E is only used to force name expansion to make private def x that is visible according to scala lang, accessible at runtime by JVM.
Now why a single separator, rather than the name of the non-class owner is enough:
The conflict is caused by inadvertent overriding with
```
    val foo: D = {
    class D extends C.this.D {
    ...
```

This is possible because it's possible to reference D in outer scope. It's impossible to reference
```
    val foo: D = {
    class D extends bar.D {
    ...
```

in scala since this means referencing a virtual class, and scala doesn't have them.
