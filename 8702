Ah I see, but then why doesn't enclosing in parenthesis indicate to the compiler that the function call should be completed and the implicit implicitly resolved?

I had tried the following before submitting this bug, which is why I think I didn't entertain the possibility you mentioned.
```scala
scala> ((test(None))(1))("2").array
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: <:<[DD[D[object scala.None]],DD[D[None] with D[Int] with D[String]]]
       ((test(None))(1))("2").array
                     ^
```
