(In r21167) Leveraged -Xmigration to burn off some warts which arose in the
new collections.  Warnings put in place for behavioral changes,
allowing the following.  1) Buffers: create new collections on
++ and -- like all the other collections.  2) Maps: eliminated
never-shipped redundant method valuesIterable and supplied these
return types:

  def keys: Iterable[A]
  def keysIterator: Iterator[A]
  def values: Iterable[B]
  def valuesIterator: Iterator[B]
  def keySet: Set[A]

I concluded that keys should return Iterable because keySet
also exists on Map, and is not solely in the province of Maps
even if we wanted to change it: it's defined on Sorted and
also appears in some Sets.  So it seems sensible to have keySet
return a Set and keys return the more general type.
