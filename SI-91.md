The compiler appears to refer to objects nested inside objects directly rather than via the parent, which is fine, except that it fails to emit an accessor in the parent object at all, which weakens Java compatibility and breaks Scala inheritance. The following code throws an !AbstractMethodError because the emitted C does not implement m:

```scala
trait A { def x : Int }
trait B { val m : A }
object C extends B {
    object m extends A { def x = 5 }
}
object Main {
    // The type annotation here is necessary, otherwise
    // the compiler would reference C$$m$$ directly.
    def o : B = C
    def main(argv : Array[String]) : Unit = {
        println(o.m.x)
    }
}
```
Runtime error: java.lang.AbstractMethodError: C$$.m()LA;
