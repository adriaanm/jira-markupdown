The Unit value () does in fact support asInstanceOf, isInstanceOf, and ##. The specification section 12.2.3 states "[i]t implements only three methods equals, hashCode, and toString from class Any."

{code}
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    ().asInstanceOf[Unit]
    ().isInstanceOf[Unit]
    ().##
    println("uh oh")
  }
}
{code}

That should either not compile or fail at run-time, the spec doesn't explicitly say which. Instead, it runs. This could be related to SI-1245, I dunno.

Additionally, asInstanceOf allows casting to AnyRef (boxing I assume) which is especially important to document.
