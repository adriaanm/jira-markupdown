The following deadlocks:

{code}
object LazyValDeadLock extends App {
  println((new Z).Y)
}

class Z {
  lazy val X = 0
  lazy val Y = {
    // 'mentioning' X here solves the problem:
    // X
    for (i <- 0 until 2 par) yield {
      println(i)
      X
    }
  }
}
{code}
I found the same bug, is it supposed to be solved?
The suggest linked above is closed

Note the bug can be synthesized with the following code example:
{noformat}
object o{
  lazy val a = 1
  lazy val b = (1 to 1).par.map( i => o.a + i )
}    
o.b // never ends
{noformat}
SIP is at [the SIP page|http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/improved-lazy-val-initialization.html] but I'm not sure what the status is.

It would be nice for the issue tracker to track SIPs for easy linking, maybe as a dedicated "Type" (SIP) or "Status" (Sipped).

The behavior is "not a bug" (because it's a feature or implementation detail) but also not "won't fix"; it's "out of scope" for an ordinary issue.
