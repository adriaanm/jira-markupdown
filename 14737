The Scala wizards in Eclipse are missing a lot of functionality and suffer from various usability mistakes (usage of dropdown menus to select packages etc). It would be great if you could change the Scala wizards to reuse the JDT wizards so that the Scala wizards gain functionality and improve in usability.

The Groovy plugin reuses the [http://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/eclipse/trunk/ide/org.codehaus.groovy.eclipse.ui/src/org/codehaus/groovy/eclipse/wizards/ JDT wizards] and could possibly be used as a starting point for implementing this enhancement.

This request is the result of an unrelated discussion in SI-2554 and relates to SI-2682.
