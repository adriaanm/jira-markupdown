As you can see in #4311, null.## is supposed to be 0 and not an NPE. And it is, right up until extension methods get involved.
```

scala> null.##
res0: Int = 0

scala> (null: Predef.Ensuring[_]).##
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at scala.Predef$Ensuring$.hashCode$extension(Predef.scala:236)
	at scala.Predef$Ensuring.hashCode(Predef.scala:236)
	at scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime$.hash(ScalaRunTime.scala:214)
	at .<init>(<console>:7)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:7)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at $print(<console>)
```
"It's harder to fix than it looks, unfortunately."

I'm running tests now, so perhaps the reasons will dawn on me soon, but I would have thought we could just call `underlying.##` from the synthetic value class `hashCode` and all would be peachy.

https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/7396

```scala
scala> class Foo(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> implicit class Foo(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> (null: Foo).##
res0: Int = 0
```
```
testing: [...]/files/run/Meter.scala                                  [FAILED]
testing: [...]/files/run/MeterCaseClass.scala                         [FAILED]
...
```
Those failures some from the difference between

```scala
scala> 1d.hashCode
res0: Int = 1072693248

scala> 1d.##
res1: Int = 1
```
A variation reported on the mailing lists:

```
scala> class A(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class A

scala> new Array[A](1).apply(0).hashCode
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at .<init>(<console>:10)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .$print$lzycompute(<console>:7)
	at .$print(<console>:6)
```
@retronym this last example seems unrelated to hashCode:

```scala
scala> class A(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class A

scala> new Array[A](1).apply(0)
java.lang.NullPointerException
```
@dwijnand, perhaps you'd like to take a look?
Is the last expression here therefore equally wrong?

```scala
scala> 1d.hashCode
res0: Int = 1072693248

scala> 1d.##
res1: Int = 1

scala> class Foo(val x: Double) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> new Foo(1d).hashCode
res2: Int = 1072693248

scala> new Foo(1d).##
res3: Int = 1072693248
```

(Also, is it part of this ticket, or a separate issue?)
