As you can see in SI-4311, null.## is supposed to be 0 and not an NPE. And it is, right up until extension methods get involved.
{noformat}

scala> null.##
res0: Int = 0

scala> (null: Predef.Ensuring[_]).##
java.lang.NullPointerException

"It's harder to fix than it looks, unfortunately."

I'm running tests now, so perhaps the reasons will dawn on me soon, but I would have thought we could just call {{underlying.##}} from the synthetic value class {{hashCode}} and all would be peachy.

{code}
scala> class Foo(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> implicit class Foo(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> (null: Foo).##
res0: Int = 0
{code}
{noformat}
testing: [...]/files/run/Meter.scala                                  [FAILED]

Those failures some from the difference between

{code}
scala> 1d.hashCode
res0: Int = 1072693248

scala> 1d.##
res1: Int = 1
{code}
A variation reported on the mailing lists:

{noformat}
scala> class A(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class A

scala> new Array[A](1).apply(0).hashCode
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at .<init>(<console>:10)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .$print$lzycompute(<console>:7)
	at .$print(<console>:6)
{noformat}
[~retronym] this last example seems unrelated to hashCode:

{code}
scala> class A(val a: Any) extends AnyVal
defined class A

scala> new Array[A](1).apply(0)
java.lang.NullPointerException
{code}
[~dwijnand], perhaps you'd like to take a look?
Is the last expression here therefore equally wrong?

{code}
scala> 1d.hashCode
res0: Int = 1072693248

scala> 1d.##
res1: Int = 1

scala> class Foo(val x: Double) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> new Foo(1d).hashCode
res2: Int = 1072693248

scala> new Foo(1d).##
res3: Int = 1072693248
{code}

(Also, is it part of this ticket, or a separate issue?)
