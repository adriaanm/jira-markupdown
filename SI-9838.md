Code exhibiting the issue:
{code:title=GimmeFive.scala|borderStyle=solid}
object GimmeFive {

  def produceAnIntegerEquivalentToFive(): Int = {
    // I know I'm supposed to output a 5, but I can only
    return 4 // You might not be happy with getting just
    4 // But I honestly can't count any higher!

    // If you think about it, 4 is already quite big
    // So actually it shouldn't make any difference!

    // Just to make sure, we'll perform an additional check
    // (It is definitely possible to use 5 at compile time!)
  }.ensuring(_ == 5)

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // The specifications require that we give the user a five

    // Unfortunately, there are no known methods for that
    // So instead we provide a value which behaves the same
    println(produceAnIntegerEquivalentToFive())
  }

  /* TODO: The above code is likely to be refactored.
   * We have discovered a workaround involving adding 1 to 4
   * Mathematically, this ought to give an exact result for 5!
   * However, this needs testing before going into production.
   * It might not work properly on all architectures we support
   * Or maybe it needs some sort of saturation mode turned on...

Now that Scala is becoming a mainstream language, after prioritising compatibility with Java, allowing you to successfully leech off its wealth of libraries available, whilst also depriving all the real functional programming languages of a user base, and in the process making the tragically awful Java even *more* popular - languages that have decent compile times and may compile natively, where I can discover the syntax by downloading a language reference (as a PDF), rather than having to trawl through HTML web pages, then wade through a bunch of 'SIPs', hosted on multiple different sites, done in a way to imitate Python, whilst also not bothering to document the language in one place - it would be _really_ nice if you could make your language at least function correctly, and work, for parts of the library that are included in *every* file, so I can have at least _some_ hope of persuading managers that it's a good idea to rewrite all our code, currently written in Java (and therefore completely unmaintainable) into a language which is vaguely usable - and have basic code contracts, without having to implement it ourselves, or wait for Java Modeling Language to support Java 8 (that still doesn't do generics properly back from Java 5 - not that generics even work if you end up having to write {{@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")}} once per 2000 lines of code).

There are only 74 things inside your 'Predef' (a.k.a. Prelude), so don't you think you should have some sort of basic regression tests for *all* of these?  Assuming that they ever worked of course.  This horrific bug ought be fixed immediately, in priority over trying to compete with Java 8, which you will be losing users to, and quite rightly so.

Whilst you're at it, don't you think it would be good idea to have {{@elidable}} levels for {{require}} and {{ensuring}}, like you already have for {{assert}}, so that one day, when static analysis tools actually exist, it will be possible to optimize those out as well?  (Obviously, {{require}} should have the highest value, because it can be replaced by {{assert}} if you're desperate, and it is normally used for argument checking, which you probably want to keep.)

Wouldn't it be useful if you could also specify the {{@elidable}} level independently for each assertion, because maybe some of them are really computationally expensive and acceptable to remove at runtime, and some of them aren't?

Also, wouldn't it be great if for all these assertions, the code expression is contained in the error message, so that when you don't have access to the source code, it's still possible to understand what went wrong when you input invalid values?

Additionally, wouldn't it make things easier if the 'require's and 'ensuring's were included in the Scaladocs, so you don't have to write it all out twice, and allow the user to have any clue what the contract is, without reading the source code, that they might not even have?  (Obvious problem with this one is that these assertions have access to non-API-exposed variables - but ones actually using those are meaningless and can safely be filtered out.)

There's no way I'm making time to write all those out as separate feature requests, but if you like them, you can always make them yourself.  Once you've implemented all that, you can claim code contracts as a feature worth having in your default namespace, that people should be using.

Right now though, it's transparently completely broken and useless, as indicated in the example provided.  If {{ensuring}} doesn't work with {{return}}, then what's the point in having it at all?
Workaround (with long syntax--could skip the `meets` and just have `def ensure[A](f: => A)(p: A => Boolean): A`

{code}
class EnsureSyntax[A](private val underlying: () => A) extends AnyVal {
  def meets(p: A => Boolean): A =
    try {
      underlying() match {
        case x if p(x) => x
        case y         => throw new Exception("Ensuring condition failed")
      }
    }
    catch {
      case ct: scala.util.control.ControlThrowable =>
        throw new Exception("Non-local escape from ensure block")
    }
}

def ensure[A](f: =>A): EnsureSyntax[A] = new EnsureSyntax(() => f)
{code}

In action:

{code}

scala> def foo: Int = ensure { return 4; 4 } meets { _ == 5 }
foo: Int

scala> foo
java.lang.Exception: Non-local escape from ensure block
  at EnsureSyntax$.meets$extension(<console>:20)
  at .foo(<console>:13)
  ... 33 elided
{code}
I suggest we simply close as "not a bug". everything here is working as designed. {{return}} does a non-local exit from the enclosing method, full stop. normal Scala code doesn't use {{return}} at all, anyway.

there are things in here that could be separate tickets and/or PR improvements. perhaps someone reading this will be motivated to create those tickets and/or PRs, even if the original reporter wasn't.
