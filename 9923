This slightly less minimized example illustrates a situation where its necessary to use early initialization and private[this] together.  The field is passed to the base constructor, but it must have private[this] visibility or else it break covariance.

{code}
package nimrandsLibrary.dnd4E

class Signal[T] {
  //snip
}

class Base[+T](signal : Signal[T]) {
  //does stuff with signal
}

class Super[+T] extends {
  
  private[this] val _field = new Signal[T]()

  //performs operations on _field

} with Base[T](_field) {
  
  //does other stuff with _field
  
}
{code}
