Since upgrading to Scala 2.7.2, I have been getting an occasional and unpredictable 'timer' error when using Actor.reactWithin.
```scala
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Timer already cancelled.
```

It was hard to debug my program directly, so I looked at the `scala.actors` source to see if I could find any possible causes. I found one problem. Hopefully it is the same one as I'm seeing in my program!

The exception message gives a good clue, so I looked at when the Timer is cancelled.
This happens in `FJTaskScheduler2` when `ActorGC.allTerminated` is true.
ActorGC counts current reactions to work out whether any actors are live.
This count is incremented when an actor starts,
and decremented when it becomes unreachable or terminates.

Unfortunately, the lifetime of `ActorProxy` instances don't seem to be captured properly.
This is because `ActorGC.newActor` isn't called when they're created.
Even if it were called, I'm not sure how we could find out when the `ActorProxy` terminates...

Anyway, the following code demonstrates the problem:
```scala
import scala.actors.Actor
class ReactWithinThread extends Thread {
  override def run() = {
    Actor.reactWithin(1) { case x => () }
  }
}
(new ReactWithinThread).start
Thread.sleep(1000) // Wait for scheduler to poll ActorGC
(new ReactWithinThread).start
```

It causes the following exceptions with build 2.8.0.r16921-b2001734 running Java 1.6.0_03-p3 on Mac OS 10.4.11. The program works fine in Scala 2.7.1.
