I just had the following wrong error reported in a Scala source (https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-worksheet/blob/master/org.scalaide.worksheet/src/org/scalaide/worksheet/ScriptCompilationUnit.scala):

ambiguous reference to overloaded definition, both method canEqual in class ScriptCompilationUnit of type (x$1: Any)Boolean and method canEqual in class ScriptCompilationUnit of type (x$1: Any)Boolean match argument types (org.scalaide.worksheet.ScriptCompilationUnit) and expected result type Boolean

This happened with the latest Scala 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT (version: 2.10.0-20121011-125927-25ad7876a9)

UPDATE
======

After careful investigation we found the issue to be an API method of the presentation compiler. In certain cases it can lead to type checking twice in one run. The resolution is to deprecate, and later remove this method. The method is `CompilerControl.askTyped`.
