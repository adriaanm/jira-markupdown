Addressing all your points:

- We're using the tgz for MacPorts, so I wouldn't expect to need to modify permissions, just untarring should be sufficient.

- Regarding repackaging, MacPorts untars everything into a single directory in /opt/local/share/scala-2.9 and then creates symlinks from /opt/local/bin to the scripts.  This is laziness on my part so I don't have to modify any scripts.  Nice thing is, I don't need to worry about doing any work if there are changes to Scala's scripts.

- Thanks for the offer to build a MacPorts package, I don't know enough about that to say how it would be done.  I don't think it's necessary though as building a package is easy, see the existing Portfile [1], it just moves things into the proper location and creates some symlinks.  Also, MacPorts supports locations different than /opt/local, so I don't know how you handle that.
