I would like to be able to use the symbol � (logical NOT) as a unary prefix (as per the language spec 6.12.1, only +,-,! and ~ are allowed). The following should be legal:

```scala
implicit def BooleanW(b : Boolean) = new {
  def � = !b
  def ∧(c : Boolean) = b && c
  def ∨(c : Boolean) = b || c
}
```

This would, in turn, let me write code like:
```scala
    val a = true
    val b = a ∨ �a
```

I don't think piecemeal additions to precedence and/or allowable operator characters makes sense. Prior discussions on the ML about precedence (not the same as this ticket, but of a similar ilk) petered out without a clear case for change.

I'm not sure how it came about that they asked you for a patch.  I give this more like -10.  I can't believe the patch would ever be used, and anyway it's like a one line change, it's not like we don't know how to do it.

Like retronym says, if we're going to mess with precedence it will not be piecemeal.
