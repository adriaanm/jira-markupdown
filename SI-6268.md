The scalac task does not accept fork="true" in Scala 2.10.0-M7. It does accept fork="false".

The branch you can use to reproduce the problem is:

Just say "ant test" and it will happen very quickly.
Ok, so this simple test works:

{code}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<project name="test-simple" default="compile">
  <description>
Super simple test for Scala

  <target name="init">
     <!-- Define project CLASSPATH. -->
    <property name="base.dir" value="../../.."/>
    <property name="pack.dir" value="${base.dir}/build/pack/"/>
    <property name="build.dir" value="classes"/>
    <property name="src.dir" value="src"/>
    <path id="scala.classpath">

Time to investigate if the "too many argument" handling is broken.
FYI, I went that way because unparsing -i "foo bar.scala" as in the pull request will give us -i:foo bar.scala.  Not that the world will be full of workingness when you have spaces in your path.

The issue is that your patch needed to merge the list of string into one:

{code}
def unparse = if(values.isEmpty) Nil 
              else name :: (value mkString " ") :: Nil
{code}

I went the less code route, assuming it still parses.   Like I said, I couldn't tell if we had automated tests, I just validated against scalatest and the ant build in that commit.   I think we should add some partest setting tests so we avoid breaking each other!
"I think we should add some partest setting tests so we avoid breaking each other!"

Well yeah, we should have done that five years ago.  As always, the obstacle to script tests (which is the meaningful way to test command line properties - from the command line) is windows.  Whenever I have tried to check in anything in this area, I have had to revert it. I no longer try. For the glory of windows, we have no tests here for anyone.
