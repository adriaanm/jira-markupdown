I'm willing to take a look at these these bugs on `drop`/`take` this week and add some tests for corner cases. Is that ok with you, or is someone looking at that already?

Sure, applying a set of tests for all collections according to the "laws" of each one, instead of writing tests for each collection that overrides something on the base traits, seems a great idea. I'll take a look at Rex's project tomorrow and add tests for the methods affected by this issue.

Meanwhile, I'm fixing this issue in the Scala library. Considering you intend to run the collection tests on each pull request, is it still useful to write old JUnit tests for this?

I have a PR that failed in the parallel collections scalacheck.  The test would work for result size < 512 because it would fall back to sequential.  This was my first time using scalacheck in anger and despair, and I am persuaded.

Looking forward to the new tool. Should we propose names on scala-debate? Scoff-laws for scala collection f-in' laws.

[~apm] I have assiduously avoided parallel collections thus far (and also large collections).  They could be added into the framework, but it runs so many tests (~17,000 at current count) that big collections can slow down the runtime noticeably.
