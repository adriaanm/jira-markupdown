At least Xexperimental isn't working. I checked it, did a clean build, error on following code is still present:


```scala
package foo

object Test {
  trait A {
    type B
    def b(n: Int): B
  }
  
  def f(a:A) = a.b(0) // illegal dependent method type
}
```

Works with command line interpreter and Xexperimental.
