This is reproducible on the command line with no changes to any of the sources,

bug2905/A.scala
```scala
package bug2905
```

bug2905/B.scala
```scala
package bug2905

package A {
}
```

now with,
```scala
scalac -sourcepath . bug2905/*.scala
```

I see,
```scala
bug2905/B.scala:3: error: A is already defined as object A
package A {
        ^
one error found
```

Nb. the explicit "-sourcepath ." is essential here ... if it is omitted the compilation will complete without error. Also note that the package name has to match a source file name in the same compilation (ie. "package A" or "package B" will trigger the problem with the files A.scala and B.scala present, but "package C" won't).
