It would be great if map collections offered basic join operations such us:

* inner join
* left join
* right join

For simplicity, this operations would only join maps (thus key uniqueness is guaranteed at each collection) so the resulting maps' values would consist on pairs of values, value-optional value and optional value - value respectively. Keeping things simple but providing rich building blocks for complex algorithms.
