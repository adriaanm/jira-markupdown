Welp, looks like your right:
```
$ scalac -Dprop=foofrommacroscalac -language:experimental.macros ./macros/src/main/scala/Macros.scala && scalac -Dprop=foofromtestscalac -language:experimental.macros ./core/src/main/scala/Test.scala && scala Test
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
one warning found
Hello World!, Macro Property: foofromtestscalac
```

Now I just need to figure out why it doesn't work when I have scalacOptions ++= Seq("-language:experimental.macros", "-Ymacro-debug-lite", "-Dprop=foo") in SBT
