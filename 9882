Well, the bug is to allow generic value classes. There's no way we can fix bridge method problem because the clash is simply unavoidable within our current scheme of erasing value classes.

One could imagine that value classes where part of specialization so the specialized (containing erased value class in signature) method would be called `apply$sp...` instead of just `apply`. This way we would avoid name clash but it would mean we are doing complete rewrite of value classes.

I believe that in current form, value classes that erase to object should be disallowed.
