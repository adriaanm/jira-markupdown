The default scripts in the unix download do not quote classpaths with the result that the scripts will work when installed in a directory such as:

/Users/dan/scala

but fail for:

/All Users/dan/scala

This affects: fsc, scala, scalac, scaladoc and scalap.

The fix in each case is to quote ${CPSELECT}${TOOL_CLASSPATH} - for example:

"${JAVACMD:=java}" \
  $JAVA_OPTS \
  "${java_args[@]}" \
  ${CPSELECT}${TOOL_CLASSPATH} \
  -Dscala.usejavacp=true \
  -Dscala.home="$SCALA_HOME" \
  -Denv.emacs="$EMACS" \
  $CYGWIN_JLINE_TERMINAL \
   scala.tools.nsc.Main  "$@"

should be:

"${JAVACMD:=java}" \
  $JAVA_OPTS \
  "${java_args[@]}" \
  "${CPSELECT}${TOOL_CLASSPATH}" \
  -Dscala.usejavacp=true \
  -Dscala.home="$SCALA_HOME" \
  -Denv.emacs="$EMACS" \
  $CYGWIN_JLINE_TERMINAL \
   scala.tools.nsc.Main  "$@"

(extempore in [r25994|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25994]) Working on the runners.

Removed assumption that bash is in /bin. Removed --posix option to bash.
Modernized shell constructs: $() instead of ``, [[ ]] instead of [ ].
Added -debug option for all runners which will show you the exact java
command line being run before running it. Added -usebootcp to complement
-nobootcp, and made regular classpath the default on cygwin. Quoted more
things to give us a fighting chance against spaces and parens in paths.

I took the waste-half-a-day step of installing vmware fusion so I could
install windows so I could install cygwin so I could install scala under
cygwin so I could see if it still worked. Seems to. We still desperately
need some way of testing not only everything I'm attempting to address
in this pile of patches but everything which is most likely now regressing.

:javap now sort of works on windows (not for repl-defined classes as yet)
if JAVA_HOME is set such that I can find tools.jar. Closes SI-4959.
(Risks breaking and) references SI-2092. References SI-622 since that
shouldn't be hard to get working.
