Noting for posterity, because I tried for this during the development of value classes, and I don't doubt it's still wontfix:

Value classes are much less useful than they could have been. The prohibition on wrapping means that you can take exactly one step down any given value class path and are frozen there forever after. If you try to use value classes in a meaningful way you will run into this restriction constantly. A nontrivial design which is not hampered is not possible.

AFAIK the only reason for the restriction is the requirement that everything be reconstructable at runtime via pattern matching. It is kind of tragic to so severely limit the power of value classes to support typeless-language style programming. If you need to pattern match your way back out of nested value classes, you are Doing It Wrong.

Here is a typical example of where it hits, even before a second API-facing value class appears. Your value class can have non-value extension methods; your non-value class can have value class extension methods; but if you would like your value class to have value class extension methods (and when exactly would you NOT want this for your value class? "Never" is when) you cannot.

```scala
object a {
  final class Meter(val amount: Int) extends AnyVal {
    def add(x: Meter) = new Meter(amount + x.amount)
  }
  final implicit class MeterOps(val meter: Meter) extends AnyRef {
    def bippy(x: Meter) = new Meter(meter.amount * x.amount)
  }
  def f(x: Meter) = (x add x) -> (x bippy x)
}

object b {
  final class Meter(val amount: Int) extends AnyRef {
    def add(x: Meter) = new Meter(amount + x.amount)
  }
  final implicit class MeterOps(val meter: Meter) extends AnyVal {
    def bippy(x: Meter) = new Meter(meter.amount * x.amount)
  }
  def f(x: Meter) = (x add x) -> (x bippy x)
}

object c {
  final class Meter(val amount: Int) extends AnyVal {
    def add(x: Meter) = new Meter(amount + x.amount)
  }
  final implicit class MeterOps(val meter: Meter) extends AnyVal {
    def bippy(x: Meter) = new Meter(meter.amount * x.amount)
  }
  // ./a.scala:25: error: value class may not wrap another user-defined value class
  //   final implicit class MeterOps(val meter: Meter) extends AnyVal {
  //                                     ^
  // one error found
  def f(x: Meter) = (x add x) -> (x bippy x)
}
```
```

Or in other words, nested value class would need to have outer pointer to preserve semantics of path-dependent types at runtime but then value class would erase to two fields and not one which is not supported at the moment.

If we are complaining about value class restrictions, how about:

```scala
class Foo[T](val x: T) extends AnyVal

class Test[T] {
	def test: Foo[T] => Foo[T] = foo => foo
}
```

If you try to compile it you get:
```scala
Test.scala:4: error: bridge generated for member method apply: (foo: Foo[T])Foo[T] in anonymous class $anonfun
which overrides method apply: (v1: T1)R in trait Function1
clashes with definition of the member itself;
both have erased type (v1: Object)Object
	def test: Foo[T] => Foo[T] = foo => foo
                                         ^
one error found
```

Which is super confusing error that no regular Scala user can possibly comprehend. However, what Scala compiler hacker can read from it is that if you have a generic value class that erases to object then there's no way you can create a lambda that takes or returns such a class. One could ask why do we even allow generic value classes if a core feature of Scala (lambdas) doesn't work with them and gives a super cryptic error message.
Well, the bug is to allow generic value classes. There's no way we can fix bridge method problem because the clash is simply unavoidable within our current scheme of erasing value classes.

One could imagine that value classes where part of specialization so the specialized (containing erased value class in signature) method would be called `apply$sp...` instead of just `apply`. This way we would avoid name clash but it would mean we are doing complete rewrite of value classes.

I believe that in current form, value classes that erase to object should be disallowed.
The clash may be unavoidable, but it doesn't follow that it can't be fixed. The conflicting bridge method is being created to forward to the method with which it is conflicting. What is the problem with just not generating the bridge, if the implementation has the same signature?

Here, this has the same problem without value class involvement. The bridge method, were it to be generated, will conflict with the definition of the member itself.
```scala
class Bippy {
  val test: Object => Object = x => x
  // Only gets (Object)Object
}
```
But it isn't a problem, because we use the implementation to satisfy the requirement for an (Object)Object method. In all other cases, there is a bridge:
```scala
class Dingo {
  val test: String => String = x => x
  // Gets (String)String and (Object)Object
}
```
It is actually different situation when value classes are involved. Let me demonstrate the problem:

```scala
class Foo[T](val x: T) extends AnyVal

class FooFunction extends Function1[Foo[Int], Foo[Int]] {
  def apply(foo: Foo[Int]): Foo[Int] = new Foo(foo.x+1)
}

val f: FooFunction = new FooFunction
val foo = new Foo(12) // foo has erased type Int
f.apply(foo) // no boxing here, we should go straight to apply(I)I method
(f: Function1[Foo[Int], Foo[Int]]).apply(foo) // we need to box into Foo before calling apply(LObject)LObject and then that method unboxes and forwards to apply(I)I
```

In this case everything works ok. However, replace Int by Object and you'll see we have a clash, you need two apply's one which assumes you have Foo passed in (and unwraps it) and the other one which assumes you have underlaying content of the method passed in. They have different method bodies but exactly the same signature. That's the problem.
So multiplex the (Object)Object method. I guess it goes bad if people are throwing around Foo[Foo[Int]]s, but in what must be the common case:
```scala
def apply(x: Object): Object = if (x instanceof Foo) apply(x.x) else actualImpl(x)
```
Ah, good point. I didn't realize that. Fundamentally, it looks like with value classes we are trying to bend erasure rules too far to fit into box (pun intended) JVM gives us. I believe much better approach is to deal with box-unboxing optimization at JVM level (by nudging JIT). It seems like an excellent topic for JVM Language summit next week.
Regardless of the insolubility of the problem in the general case, it would sure be nice to improve on this. Bytecode transcripts are after compiling under -optimise with current head in the neighborhood of 2.11.0-M6.
```scala
final class Foo(val value: Int) extends AnyVal

final object Foo {
  @inline def apply(x: Int): Foo = new Foo(x)

  // Isn't allowed to extend AnyVal due to wrapping value class
  // Doesn't do any good not to use an implicit class
  @inline implicit final class FooOps(val x1: Foo) {
    @inline def bar(x2: Foo): Foo = Foo(x1.value + x2.value)
  }
}

class A {
  // Super-optimal - implies possible omniscience on part of constant folder
  def superoptimal: Int = 5 + 5
  // 0: bipush        10
  // 2: ireturn

  // Optimal - implies only that inlining works
  def optimal: Int = (5: Int) + (5: Int)
  // 0: iconst_5
  // 1: iconst_5
  // 2: iadd
  // 3: ireturn

  def actual: Int = (Foo(5) bar Foo(5)).value
  //  0: getstatic     #20                 // Field Foo$.MODULE$:LFoo$;
  //  3: getstatic     #20                 // Field Foo$.MODULE$:LFoo$;
  //  6: astore_1
  //  7: astore_2
  //  8: new           #22                 // class Foo$FooOps
  // 11: dup
  // 12: iconst_5
  // 13: invokespecial #26                 // Method Foo$FooOps."<init>":(I)V
  // 16: getstatic     #20                 // Field Foo$.MODULE$:LFoo$;
  // 19: astore_3
  // 20: astore        4
  // 22: getstatic     #20                 // Field Foo$.MODULE$:LFoo$;
  // 25: aload         4
  // 27: invokevirtual #29                 // Method Foo$FooOps.x1:()I
  // 30: iconst_5
  // 31: iadd
  // 32: istore        6
  // 34: astore        5
  // 36: iload         6
  // 38: ireturn
}
```
So, I'm currently implementing value classes in Dotty (see https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/411) and I was trying to understand why nested value classes where forbidden in scalac, but I have to admit that I'm not sure I understand what Paul means when he says:
bq. AFAIK the only reason for the restriction is the requirement that everything be reconstructable at runtime via pattern matching.
My best guess is that this is related to something like:
```scala
case class Foo(val unFoo: Int) extends AnyVal

case class Bar(val unBar: Foo) extends AnyVal

object O {
  def thing(x: Any) = {
    x match {
      case Bar(Foo(i)) => i
      case _ => 0
    }
  }
  def test() = {
    val bf = new Bar(new Foo(1))
    thing(bf)
  }
}
```
But this work just fine in my pull request, and it doesn't seem impossible to handle in scalac either. Can someone give me an example of something that is likely to fail with nested value classes? Thanks.
