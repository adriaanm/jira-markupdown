In fact, when the spec says "is expected to conform to type PT", implicit conversions are allowed. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The expression is typed with expected type PT.
2. As part of (1), if it has at first a different type, implicit conversions are tried. If one succeeds, it gets applied, yielding a final result expression.
3. That expression does conform to PT.
