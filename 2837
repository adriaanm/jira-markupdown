I can't follow what you are saying.

What should be disallowed? I think the code makes perfect sense, and the type checker is able to handle it correctly. Only it crashes at run-time.
```scala
scala> val o = new {
     |   def f(x: Object) = new {
     |     def g(y: x.type) = 0
     |   }
     | }
o: Object{def f(x: Object): Object{def g(y: x.type): Int}} = $anon$1@7471c619

scala> val s = ""
s: String = ""

scala> val o1 = o.f(s)
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
o1: Object{def g(y: s.type): Int} = $anon$1$$anon$2@2a11890d

scala> o1.g("huh")
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("huh")
 required: s.type
              o1.g("huh")
                   ^

scala> o1.g(s)
