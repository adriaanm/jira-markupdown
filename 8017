This is actually a BitSet problem. The example works on 2.9, because it did not use BitSet internally.
If you try:
scala> val b = new mutable.BitSet
scala> b+= 2000000000
you will get either:
res0: b.type = BitSet()
or 
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Now when you use number like 2000000000 and -2000000000, since they are converted to a positive integer to store in the BitSet, you get an int overflow.
