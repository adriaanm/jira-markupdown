HashMap does not implement filter directly but defers to the generic builder-based implementation of TraversableLike. That leads to filter always creating a completely new HashMap instead of reusing the old set where possible. 

I am working on an application where it is very important to have fast map operations such as filter, and I would prefer not to have to roll my own collections. 

```scala
  val m = HashMap(1->1,2->2,3->3,4->4)
  /* this builds a completely new set, which is very inefficient */
  val n = m.filter(_ => true)
  println(m eq n) // false, should be true
  
  val u = m.filterNot(_ => false)
  println(m eq u) // true, because filterNot in MapLike removes non-matching elements. 
```
