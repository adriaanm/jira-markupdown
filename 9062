Yes, something like {{beginWriteObject}} and {{endWriteObject}} like you described would be ideal.
I have not seen such a facility on the {{ObjectOutputStream}}.

Otherwise, looks good to me!
You can fork the Scala repo and open a new branch {{issue/6961}}, apply the patch, build the repo and run all the tests ({{ant test}}), and then submit a pull request to the Scala repo on GitHub.
Or I can do this for you, as you like.
