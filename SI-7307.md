attempting to register a KeyPressed case to the TextField reactions always fails because only ValueChanged is fired.

```scala
  val nameField = new TextField {
    columns = 40
    reactions += {
      case e: Any => log.info(e.toString)
    }
  }
```


workaround is to drop down to Java Swing...

```scala
  val nameField = new TextField {
    columns = 40
  }
  nameField.peer.addKeyListener(new KeyListener {
    def keyTyped(e: KeyEvent) {println(e)}

    def keyPressed(e: KeyEvent) {println(e)}

    def keyReleased(e: KeyEvent) {println(e)}
  })
```
