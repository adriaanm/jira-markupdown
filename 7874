As discussed at [scala-internals/OhGZeyBAGig ](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/OhGZeyBAGig/discussion) , verbatim comparison of javap output is inflexible. 

That can be addressed in a manner similar to `scala.tools.partest.CompilerTest` :
- emit classfiles as usual
- have a `DirectTest` subclass parse each classfile using ASM's Tree API
- have an "acceptor" class provided as part of the test that inspects the trees parsed above.
  The ASM Tree API does not support a "bytecode query language" nor a DSL to that effect, but still drilling into details of interest should be easier to maintain than verbatim javap output.
