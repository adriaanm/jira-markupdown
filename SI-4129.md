The implementations of assert/assume define the {{message}} argument as a call-by-name parameter.
This means that the price for constructing messages need to be paid only if the assertion is not met.

The ensuring methods defined in class {{Ensuring}} however use eager parameter. This means, that messages are constructed even if the condition is met. This behavior should be changed. The fact, that the message parameters in the called assert method is a call-by-name parameter is not enough.

The implementation of the two {{ensuring}}-methods with the {{msg}} parameters in class {{Predef.Ensuring}} should be changed to
{code}
  final class Ensuring[A](val x: A) {
    def ensuring(cond: Boolean, msg: => Any): A = { assert(cond, msg); x }
    def ensuring(cond: A => Boolean, msg: => Any): A = { assert(cond(x), msg); x }
    ...
  }
{code}
(In r23931) The ensuring methods should be by-name on the message argument
like assert, assume, and require.  Closes SI-4129, no review.
