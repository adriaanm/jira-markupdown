Hi everybody,

Having the following code

{code:scala}
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val f1 = List(Future(1))
Future.sequence(f1)

val f2 = Option(Future(1))
Future.sequence(f2)
{code}

The first *Future.sequence* works whereas the second one doesn't.

According to the *Future.sequence* signature, it requires *M[ X ]* to be a subtype of *TraversableOnce[ X ]*.

Would it make sense to require an implicit conversion {code:scala}M[X] => TraversableOnce[X]{code} in order to make possible applying *Future.sequence* to an *Option*? 

What do you think? :-)



I'm not sure about which hypothetical change would have a deeper impact in the Scala api.
But ideally, making Option extending from Traversable sounds better to me. 
I guess that would also fix some other open language proposals like https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5283.
