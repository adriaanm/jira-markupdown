Also, I managed the surprisingly difficult task of verifying the signatures through direct inspection, or at least some of them -- but it's promising that it's all of them because only three malformed signatures were identified among the compiler classes, and one was trackSetInfo.  (There were also some exceptions thrown, I haven't looked into those yet.) The other two:
{code}
Trees.scala
public abstract resetAttrs	(Lscala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees$$Tree;)Lscala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees$$Tree;
signature: <A:Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/ScalaObject.Tree;>(TA;)TA;

ModelExtractor.scala
public abstract sort	(Lscala/Iterable;)Lscala/Iterable;
signature: <E:Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/ScalaObject.Entity;>(Lscala/Iterable<TE;>;)Lscala/Iterable<TE;>;
{code}
This information comes by way of javassist's javassist.tools.Dump.
