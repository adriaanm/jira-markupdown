In 2.7.4, this code does not compile

```scala
object Broken {
  private var map = Map[Class[_], String]()
  
  def addToMap(c : Class[_], s : String) = map += (c -> s)
  def fetch(c : Class[_]) = map(c)
}
```

```scala
type mismatch;
 found   : c.type (with underlying type Class[_])
 required: Class[_$$2] where type _$$2	Test.scala
```

But replace the "->" tuple arrow with a syntactic tuple and the code works fine

```scala
object Works {
  private var map = Map[Class[_], String]()
  
  def addToMap(c : Class[_], s : String) = map += ((c, s))
  def fetch(c : Class[_]) = map(c)
}
```
In trunk, the error is now:

```scala
test/pending/pos/t1974.scala:4: error: value -> is not a member of Class[_]
  def addToMap(c : Class[_], s : String) = map += (c -> s)
                                                     ^
```

It seems that ``any2ArrowAssoc`` in ``Predef`` is not applicable in that case. ``->`` is normally available on classes:

```scala
scala> this.getClass -> 4
res2: (java.lang.Class[?0], Int) forSome { type ?0 } = (class ,4)
```
(In r22455) Test case for #1974, which was fixed at some point even though
martin says in the comments it wouldn't be fixed for 2.8.
Take that, things which think they won't be fixed which really
will be.  Closes #1974, no review.
