Just looking at the source for StringContext. In the 'while (ai.hasNext)' loop, it calls treatEscapes. I think it should call the 'process' function passed in as a parameter. 
For refrence:

```scala
def standardInterpolator(process: String => String, args: Seq[Any]): String = {
    checkLengths(args)
    val pi = parts.iterator
    val ai = args.iterator
    val bldr = new java.lang.StringBuilder(process(pi.next()))
    while (ai.hasNext) {
      bldr append ai.next
      bldr append treatEscapes(pi.next())
    }
    bldr.toString
  }
```

This means that the raw interpolator does not work correctly:

```scala
  def raw(args: Any*): String = standardInterpolator(identity, args)
```
Stumbled across this bug just minutes after starting to play with 2.10.0-RC2:
```
scala> val x = "x"
x: String = x

scala> raw"\n$x\n"
res1: String = 
"\nx
"
```


It seems like there is a patch already committed (0b7aaa5 by Julien Richard-Foy), which is on the master branch, but not in 2.10.0-RC2.
Please change the docs on `raw` to state that it is broken if it's not going to be fixed for .0.  The first thing I did with raw was not raw, which was (1) confusing given that there was no documentation and (2) would not inspire a lot of confidence in me for using a .0 release if I wasn't following the dev process and tried this early.
Jason: We can change the semantics if we clearly state it in the release note or the doc comment. That said I am also OK in fixing it now, if there is to be another RC. Not having an opinion for or against.
