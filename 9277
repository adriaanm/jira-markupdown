That's a good question. I'm not really sure what is triggering the creation and retention of that outer pointer.

e.g. what is different about Types/TypeRef to this example?

{code}
scala> trait T { val t = "t"; class C { def tt = t }; object O { def foo = new C {} } }
defined trait T

scala> new T{}.O.foo.getClass.getDeclaredFields
res2: Array[java.lang.reflect.Field] = Array()
{code}

Needs some investigation.
