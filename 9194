Get rid of -=, +=, but keep covariant protected\[this\]. We will not be able to read collections as they are then.

What's the problem with collections? The text above mentions protected\[this\]. Then, they also do things like defining C, _all the time_, for refining the arguments of *Like traits — and I guess also other code does it. The text seems assume even more — what is it? I'd expect that with the "straightforward encoding into member types", you can't actually call newBuilder (or Builder methods) without casts.
