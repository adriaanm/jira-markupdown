I was making this inline, and on the way found that it doesn't even warn right now.  (So my test doesn't fail like it should.)
```scala
sealed abstract class Foo {
  @inline def bar(x: Int) = x + 1
}
object Foo {
  def mkFoo(): Foo = new Baz2
}

object Baz1 extends Foo
final class Baz2 extends Foo

object Test {
  // bar should be inlined now
  def f = Foo.mkFoo() bar 10
}
```
In 2.9 it correctly says
```
scalac29 -optimise test/files/pos/sealed-final.scala
test/files/pos/sealed-final.scala:13: warning: Could not inline required method bar because it is not final.
  def f = Foo.mkFoo() bar 10
                      ^
one warning found
```
