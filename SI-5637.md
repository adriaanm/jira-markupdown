I recently have been playing a lot with the parallel collections and have been using {{GenIterable}}, {{GenSeq}} and {{GenMap}} more often in the code I write, wherever they are suitable.

Unfortunately, what they are still missing are the sorting functions {{sorted}}, {{sortBy}} and {{sortWith}} - not just with the parallel collection, as they are currently provided just for {{scala.collection.SeqLike}}.

Of course I can use {{someCollection.toSeq.sorted}} and I know this is not much boilerplate, but it can be reduced. A little more awkward is sorting a {{Map}}, especially when using {{groupBy}}, because it does not return a sorted {{Map}}, which then has to be passed to {{TreeMap}} explicitly.

To summarize, really awesome would be:

- parallel sorting, e.g. some kind of divide and conquer merge sort, as it has been suggested at scala-debate
- {{sorted}}, {{sortBy}} and {{sortWith}} at the top of the collection hierarchy, i.e. {{GenTraversableOnce}}, even if they are just forwarders, e.g. {{toSeq.sorted}}, to reduce boilerplate - of course, better, more suitable, i.e. efficient, algorithms should be implemented later
I finally came up with an implementation based on type classes for now (didn't have the time to get into the vastness of information needed for implementing this directly for scala.collection._):

  https://github.com/wookietreiber/scala-collection-extras

The main part consists of this:

{code}
  def merge[A:Ordering](xs: CC[A], y: A) = { 
    val (ps,ss) = xs.partition(implicitly[Ordering[A]].lt(_,y))
    val builder = xs.genericBuilder[A]
    builder ++= ps.seq
    builder  += y
    builder ++= ss.seq
    builder.result.asInstanceOf[CC[A]]
  }   

  @tailrec
  def mergeAll[A:Ordering](xs: CC[A], ys: CC[A]) =
    if (ys.isEmpty) xs else mergeAll(merge(xs,ys.head), ys.tail.asInstanceOf[CC[A]])

  def sort[A:Ordering](xs: CC[A]) =
    xs.aggregate(xs.genericBuilder[A].result.asInstanceOf[CC[A]])(merge, mergeAll)

  def shuffle[A](xs: CC[A]): CC[A] =
    sortBy(xs) { _ â‡’ nextLong }
{code}

An example is included in the github projects README. 

Since all thats required are partition, aggregate, head tail decomposition and a builder I expect this to work with all collections.

The shuffle is just a straightforward implementation based on sorting by a random number.
There is a serious performance issue with this approach and parallel collections: the inefficiency of the needed head/tail decomposition and partition that is used for inserting an element in an already sorted collection (at least with the parallel collections that are provided now).

What we would need to make this efficient for parallel sorting would be a collection which has the following properties:

* efficient head/tail decomposition (like List has)
* efficient insert of a single element in an already sorted collection (possibly using buckets where each bucket is responsible for the same element)
