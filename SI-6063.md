As an example, take java.lang.Throwable as our superclass. 

```
% cat O.scala
object O extends Throwable
% scalac29 -version
Scala compiler version 2.9.2 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
% scalac29 O.scala
% cat J.java
public class J {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    O.getStackTraceDepth();
  }
}
% javac -version
javac 1.6.0_33
% javac -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.2/lib/scala-library.jar J.java
J.java:3: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method getStackTraceDepth()
location: class O
    O.getStackTraceDepth();
     ^
1 error
```

2.10.0-M4 does generate a forwarder, but woe to she who attempts to actually use it:

```
% rm *.class
% scalac210 -version
Scala compiler version 2.10.0-M4 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
% scalac210 O.scala
% javac -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.2/lib/scala-library.jar J.java
% java -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.2/lib/scala-library.jar J
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method java.lang.Throwable.getStackTraceDepth()I from class O
	at O.getStackTraceDepth(O.scala)
	at J.main(J.java:3)
```

A quick look with javap shows that the body of the forwarder is confused about the static-ness of the method it's trying to forward to:

```
% javap -c -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.2/lib/scala-library.jar O
...
public static int getStackTraceDepth();
  Code:
   0:	getstatic	; //Field O$.MODULE$:LO$;
   3:	invokevirtual	; //Method O$.getStackTraceDepth:()I
   6:	ireturn
...
```

My examples don't have package declarations, but I don't think that matters because I hit this in real code and in the real code everything was in packages.

It's true you can avoid the runtime error by simply not attempting to use the broken static forwarder, but I'm afraid that doesn't really solve it because the invalid forwarders may confuse tools. For example, they cause ProGuard to abort and exit when processing my real code.

This appears related to #3452 (which itself has many related tickets).
I checked and the same thing still happens on master as of two days ago:
```
% rm *.class                                                          
% ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.10.0-20120709-094806-e9afc228fd -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
% ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac O.scala
% javac -classpath ~/scala/dists/latest/lib/scala-library.jar:. J.java
% java -classpath ~/scala/dists/latest/lib/scala-library.jar:. J      
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method java.lang.Throwable.getStackTraceDepth()I from class O
	at O.getStackTraceDepth(O.scala)
	at J.main(J.java:3)
```
The thing is that `j.l.Throwable.getStackTraceDepth()` is package-protected, and the following program doesn't compile:

```
object O extends Throwable

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    O.getStackTraceDepth()
  }
}
```

The error reads

```
error: method getStackTraceDepth in class Throwable cannot be accessed in object O
    O.getStackTraceDepth()
      ^
one error found
```
