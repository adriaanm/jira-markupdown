I **really dislike** having to use trac as a support channel and re-close tickets.  You guys want stuff fixed, you better leave me some time to do something other than this.  As jason states, eta expansion cannot take place unless the expected type is a function, which is not the case in the presence of overloading.  This is as specified.

// this is the part where you are turning trac into a support line
output(42, pr1 _)
