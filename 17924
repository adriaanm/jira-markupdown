See the code below the value ledgerSet is initialised to a Set of null and not the values defined by the constants following it.

There are no warnings or errors that ledgerSet is using unitialised values which is a bit worrying. Should it give a least a warning?

if the line defining ledgerSet is moved below the line defining PENDING
then everything is OK.

{code}
object Ledger {
  val ledgerSet = List(NOTIONAL_LIABILITY, DEFERRED_LIABILITY)
  val NOTIONAL_LIABILITY = "NotionalLiability"
  val NOTIONAL_INCOME_RELEASED = "NotionalIncomeReleased"
  val INCOME_RELEASED = "IncomeReleased"
  val DEFERRED_LIABILITY = "DeferredLiability"
  val PENDING = "Pending"
}

println(Ledger.ledgerSet)  // gives List(null, null)
{code}

This version works as expected
{code}
object Ledger {
  val NOTIONAL_LIABILITY = "NotionalLiability"
  val NOTIONAL_INCOME_RELEASED = "NotionalIncomeReleased"
  val INCOME_RELEASED = "IncomeReleased"
  val DEFERRED_LIABILITY = "DeferredLiability"
  val PENDING = "Pending"
  val ledgerSet = List(NOTIONAL_LIABILITY, DEFERRED_LIABILITY)
 }
{code}
