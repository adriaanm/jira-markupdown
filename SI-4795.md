"A Scala Tutorial for Java programmers" contains an example expression evaluator in section 6 ("Case classes and pattern matching").  The example code is presented in pieces, but the pieces are never put together into a complete program.  The obvious (to a Java programmer) constructions for doing so don't work, so students are left disappointed and unable to run the code.
It would also be helpful to mention that class definitions don't need parenthesis or braces or anything, since this is the first point that is used, and it's easy for a Java programmer to lose his/her bearings without them.  To a new learner, it's not clear if the case classes are part of the {{abstract class Tree}} or not.
