=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Remove the "   * */" line and try to build scaladocs from the following code:

```scala
package lespea.scaladoc.bad

/**
 * This is a simple example that shows that embedded `/ *`
 * (without the space) break the current scaladoc parser unless
 * you "close" the new comment mark
 */
object Main {
  /**
   * Documentation containing a /* "new comment mark"
   * only compiles with the following line present (remove to test)
   * */
   */
  def go = println("hello world")
}

```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

scaladoc compiles okay

=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
bad.scala:8: error: unclosed comment
  /**
  ^
bad.scala:12: error: Missing closing brace `}' assumed here
}
  ^
two errors found
```
=== Additional information ===
Java solution exists [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MPLUGIN-181 here] but HTML escape strings do not work with scaladoc

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 (tried on latest 2.10 version as well)
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Win XP
Nested comment behavior is as specified.  #4184 covers entity support.
