The parallel collections should use the mutable and immutable traits.

e.g. scala.collection.mutable.Set gets the trait scala.Mutable from scala.collection.mutable.Iterable which in turn gets it from scala.collection.mutable.Traversable.

Similarly, scala.collection.immutable.Set gets the trait scala.Immutable from scala.collection.immutable.Iterable which in turn gets it from scala.collection.immutable.Traversable.

In contrast, scala.collection.parallel.immutable.ParSet does not implement the scala.Immutable trait, and neither does scala.collection.parallel.mutable.ParSet implement the scala.Mutable trait.

The parallel collections have the appropriate ParIterable traits, but those don't have the Mutable and Immutable traits.  Could the ParIterable traits be modified to use scala.Mutable and scala.Immutable?

Justification:

Imagine I'm writing a simple library. e.g.
 
import scala.collection.immutable.Set;
 
def myMax(s: Set[Int]) = s.max
 
But that only allows serial collections. I want to allow serial or parallel collections (and actually use the parallel implementation for parallel collections), and I will be writing everything assuming immutable collections.
 
If I switch to ParSet then I only get parallel collections. If I stick with s.c.i.Set and add a '.par' then I can accept either serial or parallel collections (with the caller having to call '.seq' sometimes), but sometimes I'll pay a performance hit to copy a serial collection into the parallel collection.  Each of these options forces the use of parallel collections rather than just allowing it.
 
If I use GenSet then I can use either serial or parallel collections, but I've lost the restriction to immutable collections. This may not be so bad - using a mutable collection as an immutable collection will be inefficient, but not incorrect. (right?)  But I'd like to add the immutable constraint back in.  I could do this if the scala.Immutable trait was used in the parallel collections, but it isn't.
