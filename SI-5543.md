In the following code, the default argument to Bar is object Bar instead of object Main.

However, scalac requires that both Main and Bar conform to the parameter type.

I'd expect Main.this to be in scope, even though the expression is evaluated by Bar$.

Reproduce Code
```scala
package trythis

//object Main { // type mismatch
object Main extends Function0[Int] {

  class Bar(x: Function0[Int] = this) {
    override def toString = "X "+ x.toString +"="+ x()
  }
  object Bar extends Function0[Int] {
    def apply() = 21
    override def toString = "My Bar module"
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(new Bar())
  }
  override def toString = "My Main"
  def apply() = 17
}
```

Expected result
```scala
X My Main=17
```

Actual Result
```scala
X My Bar module=21
```
I took a look and submitted a pull request.

The problem seems to be that when default-getters for constructors are added to the companion module, the expression has the module in scope.

Adding constrTyperIf(flag) before entering typedDefDef seems to work.

Since there is no flag for default-getter for ctor, it does a name compare. It might be preferable to add a flag or abuse an existing flag instead.

This change includes renaming init$default$ to init$$default$ to avoid collisions with default-getters for an ordinary method on the module named init. 

That change is not trivial, so guidance is needed. Alternatively, one could live with the possibility of name collision and just allow that there are interactions that impose limits, similar to #5366.

More example: 

```scala
object A {
  val v = 7
  class B(val x: Int = v)
  object B {
    val v = 5
    //def init(y: Int = v) = y  // names collide
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println(new B().x) // 5
  }
}

```

The fix goes too far because it also affects `this` references of auxiliary constructors.

```scala
object T {
  override def toString = "T"

  // here, `this` should refer to T. That's what was fixed
  class C(val x: Any = this) {
    override def toString() = "C"
  }

  class D(val x: Any) {
    override def toString() = "D"
    // here, `this` should refer to the D instance, but after the fix it also
    // refers to T.
    def this(a: Int, b: Int, c: Any = this) { this(c) }
  }
}

println((new T.C()).x)     // prints "T", correct
println((new T.D(0,0)).x)  // prints "T", should print "D"
```
actually i changed my mind, the fix / current behavior is correct. it doesn't make sense to have the class members in scope when typing (auxiliary or primary) constructor defaults (or types).

```scala
class C { type T; def this(x: T) { this() } }                 // gives `not found: type T`
class C(x: Int) { def this(a: Int, b: Int = x) { this(b) } }  // gives `not found: value x`
class C { val x = 0; def this(a: Int = x) { this() } }        // also  `not found: value x`
```

spec 5.3.1: The signature and the self constructor invocation of a constructor definition are type-checked and evaluated in the scope which is in effect at the point of the enclosing class definition, augmented by any type parameters of the enclosing class and by any early definitions of the enclosing template. The rest of the constructor expression is type-checked and evaluated as a function body in the current class.
Featured in Scala puzzlers just now :-) Should we really allow referring to `this` in defaults? This should not compile, but does: 

```scala
object Foo {
case class Foo(x: String = this.toString)
}
```

Let's reboot the discussion.
I want to focus on the next puzzler, so didn't look to closely at the rest of the ticket.
The [comment on the puzzler](https://github.com/scalapuzzlers/scalapuzzlers.github.com/pull/116#discussion_r23472649) was that this is [another issue](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8884).

In the U.S., you get three years to amend a tax return and three years to amend a community contribution.

```
But if you're lucky, it won't get fixed before the second edition of the puzzlers book.
```

However, that should have read:
```
You're lucky if Jason doesn't notice the issue, assign it to himself and fix it before Scala Days. 
Or rather, at Scala Days during lunch the day of your presentation. Or maybe during the five
minutes you give people to figure out what's going on.
```
