Regarding ticket SI-3974, one favored practice to deal with dynamic calls involves: 

a) know where they occur: {{-Ylog:cleanup -Ydebug}}

b) manually create a named class/interface, and use that as the explicit return type of the expression instead of a refinement type. 


Should the refactoring in (b) above be part of the compiler, or is it for lint? In some cases a block-local class would be added, othertimes a template-level one (with the same visibility as the LHS of the assignment?). And, after adding a named type (before {{CleanUp}}) retyping is needed. Any cons other than that? 

Replying to [ticket:3975 magarcia]:

The example in ticket SI-3974 does not show method-chaining of dynamic calls, but they are also amenable to refactoring as the following example shows: 

{code}
    new AnyRef {
      def abc { ... }
    }.abc
{code}


formulated using "atomic evaluation" becomes 

{code}
  {
    val tmp = new AnyRef {
      def abc { ... }
    }
    tmp.abc
  }
{code}

thus making room for the class definition: 

{code}
  {
    class Boilerplate extends AnyRef {
      def abc { ... }
    }
    val tmp = new Boilerplate
    tmp.abc
  }
{code}


The recipe above does away with reflective calls in several situations, but some remain. For them, a refinement type reference can sometimes be traced back to a single allocation site, thus guaranteenig that a named class can be inserted instead. Looks like deciding whether one such usage can be "traced back to a single allocation site" is a task for points-to analysis. For example, the following POPL 2011 accepted paper presents recent ideas on that:

Just for those students reading this who might be looking for a thesis topic :)
