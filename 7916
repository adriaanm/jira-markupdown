You can't write it in 2.10.
```scala
scala> val f: (String*) => Int = new ((String*) => Int) { def apply(xs: String*) = 5 }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String* => Int
 required: Seq[String] => Int
```
It's pointless to debate it too much because all we can do is chase angels around the head of a pin.  What we need is a clear statement, not to be spending our time parsing and reparsing the spec hoping it will suddenly become unambiguous through spontaneous disambiguation.
