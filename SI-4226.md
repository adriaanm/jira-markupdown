=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Following SI-4193:

{code}
object Log {
  def log(m: => String) = println("1:"+m) 
  def log(m: String) = println("2:"+m)
}
{code}


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

A message reporting an ambiguity.


=== What do you see instead? ===

The by-value parameter method is picked.

=== Additional information ===

Ticket SI-4193.

For SI-3761 there is a rejected PR https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/585 that tries to force the issue (if I ask for =>A, give me that) and the accepted PR https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/595 where Lukas says Martin was surprised by the outcome of this issue. FWIW.
