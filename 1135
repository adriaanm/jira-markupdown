BTW this looks to me like a loop in the overcomplicated stringification performed in all these intertwined classes, tickled when something is duplicated on the classpath I guess, but an inherent logic error regardless.  It's certainly not a generic "not enough memory" issue or the stack trace wouldn't be so easily reproducible (see dups SI-1941 and SI-1989 for identical traces.)
