The following code can be compiled with no errors by 2.10.0

```java
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_32).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala>   def packAny(value: Any) {
     |     value match {
     |       case x: collection.GenMapLike[_,_,_]  =>
     |         for((k,v) <- x) { ??? }
     |     }
     |   }
packAny: (value: Any)Unit
```

But cannot be compiled by 2.10.1 and 2.10.2

This is basically a duplicate of #7222.

In 2.10.0, the parser phase of the compiler desugared your for-comprehension as irrefutable, ie to ` x.foreach { case (k, v) => } `.

However, it can't do that in general for tuple patterns; they are supposed to parse to a `withFilter` call. That's important for code like:

```scala
for ( (a, b) <- List[Any]((1, 2), "boo"))
```

That code should return a one element list; if we omit the `withFilter` we'll get a `MatchError` instead.

So now your example is desugared to:

```scala
x.withFilter { case (k, v) => (k, v) }.foreach(_ => ???)
```

{withFilter} returns `Repr`, the third type argument of `GenMapLike`, which you have bound to an existential type. As such, it doesn't support `foreach`.

I suggest in this case to call `foreach` directly:

```scala
x foreach {
  case (k, v) => ???
}
```
