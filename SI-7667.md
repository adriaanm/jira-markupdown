The following code can be compiled with no errors by 2.10.0

{code:java}
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_32).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala>   def packAny(value: Any) {
     |     value match {

This is basically a duplicate of SI-7222.

In 2.10.0, the parser phase of the compiler desugared your for-comprehension as irrefutable, ie to {{ x.foreach { case (k, v) => } }}.

However, it can't do that in general for tuple patterns; they are supposed to parse to a {{withFilter}} call. That's important for code like:

{code}
for ( (a, b) <- List[Any]((1, 2), "boo"))
{code}

That code should return a one element list; if we omit the {{withFilter}} we'll get a {{MatchError}} instead.

So now your example is desugared to:

{code}
x.withFilter { case (k, v) => (k, v) }.foreach(_ => ???)
{code}

{withFilter} returns `Repr`, the third type argument of {{GenMapLike}}, which you have bound to an existential type. As such, it doesn't support {{foreach}}.

I suggest in this case to call {{foreach}} directly:

{code}
x foreach {
  case (k, v) => ???
}
{code}
