=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
import java.io.File
/**
 * @define PP This class is an instance of XXX so it's members are not called directly.
 * Instead these classes are instantiated via a driver's _process_. See YYY for more details. */
abstract class test;

/**
 * TestA class
 *
 * this is a description.
 *
 * $$PP */
class TestA extends test
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

When $$PP expands, I expect that both lines of the macro will be included in the output docs.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Just the first line of the define macro gets generated in the docs.
