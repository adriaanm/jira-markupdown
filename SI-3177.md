Tested with 2.8.0.r21161-b20100314020123.

This test case exhibits the same behaviour since 2.7.6. However, the same code in the context of the full Scalaz codebase compiles correctly with 2.8.0.Beta1 and fails r21161. That failure _only_ gets the second error: "not found: type $$anon" error.  

{code}
trait InvariantFunctor[F[_]] {
  def xmap[A, B](ma: F[A], f: A => B, g: B => A): F[B]
}
 
object InvariantFunctor {
  import Endo._
  
  implicit val EndoInvariantFunctor = new InvariantFunctor[Endo] {
    def xmap[A, B](ma: Endo[A], f: A => B, g: B => A): Endo[B] = (b: B) => f(ma(g(b)))    
  }
  
  // The definition about fails with:
  // anon-type.scala:9: error: not found: value b
  //       def xmap[A, B](ma: Endo[A], f: A => B, g: B => A): Endo[B] = (b: B) => f(ma(g(b)))    
  //                                                                                     ^
  //   anon-type.scala:8: error: not found: type $$anon
  //     implicit val EndoInvariantFunctor = new InvariantFunctor[Endo] {
  //                                         ^


  // These both work:
  // implicit val EndoInvariantFunctorAscribed: InvariantFunctor[Endo] = new InvariantFunctor[Endo] {
  //   def xmap[A, B](ma: Endo[A], f: A => B, g: B => A): Endo[B] = (b: B) => f(ma(g(b)))    
  // }
  // 
  // implicit val EndoInvariantFunctorStubbed = new InvariantFunctor[Endo] {
  //   def xmap[A, B](ma: Endo[A], f: A => B, g: B => A): Endo[B] = error("stub")
  // }
}

trait Endo[X]

object Endo {
  implicit def EndoTo[A](f: A => A): Endo[A] = new Endo[A] {
    def apply(a: A) = f(a)
  }

  implicit def EndoFrom[A](e: Endo[A]): A => A = e.apply(_)
}
{code}
sorry, due to the tricky interactions of type inference and implicit search, implicit values must be given explicit types
unfortunately, the logic that was supposed to report an error when the type was missing is broken (see SI-3373)
actually, it looks like I was confused: I have a fix for SI-3373 that also fixes this
still, it's advisable to give implicit values explicit types
(In r21790) closes SI-3373, SI-3177: validity check of an implicit value should consider the value as well as its accessor
review by odersky
(In r21793) Revert r21790: "closes SI-3373, SI-3177: validity check of an implicit value should consider the value as well as its accessor"
Revert r21792: "sorry, last-minute edit broke build: re-added parens"

will investigate how it broke and why my local pre-commit tests did not catch the failure...
