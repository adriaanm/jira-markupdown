For `ResultExpr`
, the latter is actually correct: “{{{ a => }}}” is rejected by the compiler (missing parameter type).

As for your question: I am not sure I can answer precisely: maybe you'll want to ask the question on the newsgroup. But my intuition is that since we are in a block, this syntax allows us to read the “=>” as “and from now on, execute the block only when applied”. For example:

{code}
{
  println(2)
  println(3)
a: Int =>
  println(4)
  println(a)
}
{code}

May be read as “print 2 and 3 once, when the block is created, and then print 4 and a whenever the block is applied”.

Otherwise, one would have to write:

{code}
{
  println(2)
  println(3)
  a: Int => {
    println(a)
    println(a*2)
  }
}
{code}

which is marginally uglier.
