I'm not sure if this is a bug or expected behavior.

{{

 trait ApplicativeLike[F[_]] { self => 
   def pure[A](a: => A): F[A]
   def ap[A,B](fa: F[A])(f: F[A => B]): F[B]
 }

}}

Now suppose I have

{{
 
 val list: ApplicativeLike[List] = ...
 list.ap(list.pure(1))(list.pure(x => x+1))

}}

I get missing parameter type on x. But A is known to be Int, and Scala should know that the type of the second argument to ap is therefore List[Int => ?]. So why is the annotation required on x?
Here's a much smaller example:

{code}
def id[A](a: A): A = a
def blerg[A, B](fa: A)(f: A => B) = 0
blerg(0)(x => x)         // okay
id(x => x): (Int => Int) // okay

blerg(0)(id(x => x))     // missing parameter type
{code}

I'm not sure whether or not local type inference is expected to figure this one out.
