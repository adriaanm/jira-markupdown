I built sbinary against M8 locally. I summed up steps necessary to reproduce here: https://gist.github.com/gkossakowski/8940448

When it comes to nightly builds, this one build only subset of Sbt that constitutes incremental compiler (and it's dependencies), see the following log entry:
```scala
[info] The following subprojects will be built in project sbt: control, io, process, interface, logging, api, relation, classfile, launcher-interface, classpath, incremental-compiler, persist, launcher, compiler-interface, compile, compiler-integration
```

See also the dbuild [definition](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbt-builds-for-ide/blob/master/sbt-all-nightly-on-2.11.x#L65):
```scala
{
        name:   "sbt",
        uri:    "git://github.com/sbt/sbt.git#0.13"
        extra: {
          sbt-version: "0.13.0",
          projects: ["compiler-interface",
                     "classpath","logging","io","control","classfile",
                     "process","relation","interface","persist","api",
                     "compiler-integration","incremental-compiler","compile","launcher-interface"
                    ],
          run-tests: false,
          commands: [ "set every Util.includeTestDependencies := false" // Without this, we have to build specs2
                    ]
        }
      }
```

In retrospect, it looks like the choice of names for jenkins jobs and configuration files was a bit unfortunate.
