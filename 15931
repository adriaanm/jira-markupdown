=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
object Log {

def log(m: =>String) = println("1:"+m) 
def log(m: String, args: Any*) = println("2:"+m)

} Log.log("test")
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
output of "1:test"


=== What do you see instead? ===
{code}
<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition, both method log in object Log of type (m: String,args: Any*)Unit and method log in object Log of type (m: => String)Unit match argument types (java.lang.String)

Log.log({"test"})
{code}

=== Additional information ===

In some cases like above, I think it obvious that designer of the Log class intended the first log method to be called if no varags are passed by the caller.
