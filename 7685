An idea that might prove useful:

- Use Migration Manager to keep GenASM and GenJVM mutually honest ( by comparing the output of {{-target:jvm-1.5-asm}} and {{-target:jvm-1.5}} ). 
- Actually, for API compatibility purposes, 1.6 classfiles can also be compared with 1.5 classfiles.
- Any other JAR diffing tool should also do, especially if available as ANT task

A [discussion | https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/sb4uiyllKmo/discussion] was started at scala-internals to gather feedback on this approach.
