It looks like this is a side effect of the change made in this  [commit](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/caf7eb6b56817fd1e1fbc1cf017f30e6f94c6bea#src/library/scala/collection/TraversableViewLike.scala) on TraversableViewLike, which overrides isEmpty to forward to the underlying collection. It looks like forwarding has advantages in terms of performance, and avoids forcing the first element of the view. It is not correct when a view represents some subset of the original collection, however.

The simplest solution might be to override isEmpty for the transformed views that cannot simply forward to the underlying collections, which is (I believe) all of them except for Mapped. Barring a better suggestion, these could be overridden to return to their old, foreach based behavior.
