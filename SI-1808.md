This fails to compile, should it?

```scala
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    reset { 0 }
  }
}
```

```scala
error: cannot cps-transform expression 0: type arguments [Int(0),Int,Nothing] do not conform to method shiftUnit's type parameter bounds [A,B,C >: B]
    reset { 0 }
            ^
```
(In r20817) use newly added typer hooks for lub and BYVALmode, giving much more precise typing. fixes #1929, #1808, #1820. review by community.
