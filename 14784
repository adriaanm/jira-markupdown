I tried to get info on mailing list, but nobody asked to my question:
I’m about trunk compiler version. Seems that here is broken compatibility with Java in following case:
Java:
`public class Test1<T extends Test3> {}
public class Test3<T> {} `
Scala:
`class Test2 extends Test1[Test3[Test4]]
class Test4`

Scala compiler complains that Test3[Test4] doesn’t conforms to Test3. And it’s sad.
So it means that Java raw types impossible to use in Scala.
