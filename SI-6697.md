Apologies if this is not a regression, or is intended.

I just tried to recompile one of our basic libs with 2.10-RC2 and hit a bizarre error. It seems to require a perfect storm of things to be the case (i.e. change package nestings, or exact classes and it disappears). The symptom of the problem is that compilation fails with the compiler reporting that some method does not exist. The method is added by implicit conversion and should be there. What is especially odd is that the compilation error disappears depending on the type of that which is to implicitly converted into.

The following is my attempt at a minimal example. Steps to reproduce

1. Create a project for scala. In package {{a.b.c}} create 3 files.

{code:title=C.scala}
package a.b.c

trait C extends Conversions

object C extends C with d.Functions
{code}
{code:title=Conversions.scala}

package a.b.c

trait Conversions extends d.Conversions

object Conversions extends Conversions
{code}

{code:title=package.scala}

package a.b

package object c extends C
{code}

4. Now create a sub-package d. In d, create 2 files

{code:title=Conversions.scala}

package a.b.c.d

import language.implicitConversions

trait Conversions {
  import Conversions._
  implicit def str2todstring(s: String) = new StrLen(s)
}

object Conversions extends Conversions {
  class StrLen(s: String) {
    def strlen = s.length
  }
}
{code}
{code:title=Functions.scala}
package a.b
package c
package d

trait Functions {

  import Conversions._
  val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
}
{code}

4. Now compile this using {{scalac 2.10.0-RC2}} and a 1.6 JDK. You will get the compile error in {{a/b/c/d/Functions.scala}}:

{noformat}
error: value strlen is not a member of String
val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
{noformat}
5. Now remove the {{import language.implicitConversions}} line from {{a.b.c.d.Conversions.scala}} and recompile with 2.9.2. It compiles just fine


Please find attached the regression example in a ZIP file {{regression-minimal.zip}}.

Please use the files *exactly* as specified. The issue goes away if, for example, you change the package declarations in the files, or omit unnecessary imports.


I have had a torrid time to reproduce this minimally. Here are some oddities

{code:title=a.b.c.d.Functions.scala}
package a.b //if these 3 package declarations are replaced by a.b.c.d it compiles OK
package c
package d

trait Functions {

  import Conversions._ //omit this line and it compiles OK
  val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
}
{code}
The above will also fail to compile with the error
{noformat}
error: value strlen is not a member of String
val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
{noformat}
If you compile with {{-Xlog-implicits}}, you can see what is happening. Alternatively, try to insert the call to the implicit conversion manaully.

{code}
% squalac -Xlog-implicits *.scala
Functions.scala:8: <str2todstring: error> is not a valid implicit value for String => ?{def strlen: ?} because:
reference to str2todstring is ambiguous;
it is both defined in trait Conversions and imported subsequently by 
import Conversions._
  val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
                    ^
Functions.scala:8: error: value strlen is not a member of String
  val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
                              ^
one error found
% squalac -Xlog-implicits *.scala
Functions.scala:8: error: reference to str2todstring is ambiguous;
it is both defined in trait Conversions and imported subsequently by 
import Conversions._
  val toStrLen = str2todstring((_ : String)).strlen
                 ^
one error found
{code}

Before the fix for SI-4270, this code was accepted.
