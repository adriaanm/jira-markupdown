Currently, Scala supports suppressing unchecked warning only for single expression:

```scala
(x: @unchecked) match { ... }
```

However, some classes (test cases, for example) tend to have many places where unchecked warnings arise. There should be a way to disable unchecked warnings for the whole class, like this:

```scala
@unchecked
object MyTests { ... }
```

or disable unchecked warnings for the whole compiler run:

```scala
scalac -ignore-unchecked
```

```scala
<scalac unchecked="ignore" ... />
```
We need some way of suppressing warnings which cannot otherwise be eliminated.
Since this has been closed again, noting for the record that the philosophy that generating warnings is fine but suppressing the noise is not may eventually lead your build output to look like this (obviously fictional) transcript.  Had I built with -optimise in this fictional project then we'd really have not-seen some warnings.

But the whole problem is the warnings which there is no way to eliminate.  It was perhaps a mistake to reopen this ticket, because the original submitter wants to suppress unchecked warnings  in a possibly irresponsible way.  I want to suppress the ones which either cannot be suppressed at all, or which are the best way to do something.  I want to SUPPRESS warnings because I want to HEAR MORE warnings.  "There were 51 unchecked warnings" is not hearing.

Here's the sanity test of everyone's position: why isn't -unchecked on by default? It sure as hell should be.  There is no more frequently answered question than "why doesn't this match work", and the transcript almost always shows that nice ignorable "there were unchecked warnings." But to do that we have to make it easy for people to suppress them, because there is still no other way in some cases, and certainly there's no comparably aesthetic way in others.

To be burying all of the unchecked warnings because we don't want people to bury some of them is the epitome of "we had to destroy the village in order to save it."

Some of us have the discipline to respect warnings for what they are and address them from code wherever possible.  The reality is that this is **not** always possible.  Projects generally have to consume external code either in the form of an API that they integrate with or third-party libraries that they consume, and where these break the rules (such as by marking a class as deprecated without providing a replacement yet or exposing raw types), your own code is forced to break them as well to interact with them.

Not offering any way to acknowledge the situation and suppress it from the output seriously harms the signal-to-noise ratio, with the result that developers are eventually forced to ignore **all** warnings completely for their own sanity, because they have no way to distinguish warnings that are new and should be fixed immediately from those that are known and **cannot** currently be addressed.
If by "not in my hands" you mean "not compiled by me", then invoking it from a local deprecated def will suppress the warning:

```scala
scala> @deprecated("","") def f = 8
f: Int

scala> f
<console>:9: warning: method f is deprecated: 
              f
              ^
scala> object A {
     | def a = {
     | @deprecated("","") def _f = f
     | _f
     | }}
defined object A

scala> A.a
res1: Int = 8
```

I've forgotten now whether that was a feature or a bug.  I think a feature, because local defs are not API and therefore cannot be deprecated, so invoking them cannot warn.  However, marking them deprecated says the call stack is polluted with deprecations thereafter, but you know what you're doing.  It's the `asInstanceOf` for deprecations.

This came up again, in the context of wanting -Xfatal-warnings for only some warnings, or conversely, -Xfatal-warnings but with certain unavoidable warnings suppressed.

I'm left confused here.  I want to suppress deprecation warnings over a limited scope, for exactly the reasons identified above.  This bug's title asks to suppress unchecked warnings globally, which I don't want to vote for, but the conversation has clearly moved to suppress deprecation warnings over a limited scope, which I do want to vote for.

For clarity, I've opened a new bug for that focused need: #7934.

I'd suggest closing this bug as "Won't fix."  That's a fine response to the request "suppress unchecked warnings globally."  As for everyone who voted for this bug because they wanted "suppress deprecation warnings over a limited scope," I encourage you to head over to the new bug and vote for it.
