=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
Try the following in your interpreter:
{code}
scala> val foo = <foo a="1" b="2"/>
foo: scala.xml.Elem = <foo a="1" b="2"></foo>

scala> foo == xml.XML.loadString(foo.toString)
res0: Boolean = false
{code}

Note that this only seems to happen when xml attributes are involved.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The expected behavior is that the equality expression would evaluate to "Boolean = true"


=== What do you see instead? ===
The equality expression evaluates to "Boolean = false"

=== Additional information ===
N/A

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final and 2.9.0.r24546-b20110323030254
  - Java:(Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22)
  - Operating system: Mac OSX 10.6.6
(In r24716) More fun with xml and elements not appearing equal.
