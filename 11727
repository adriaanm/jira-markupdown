I don't think your scala.bat is the same as my scala.bat.

Is it possible you tried to unset JAVACMD this way?
```
> set JAVACMD=""
```
because that will result in your error.

Instead,
```
> set JAVACMD=
```
Probably future improvements to the script will occur on active branches (2.11 or 2.12), which have already diverged slightly.
