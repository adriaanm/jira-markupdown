The following code will give the error in the bug's summary if semicolons are missing

```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  """
    x
  """ contains 'x'

  """
    x
  """ contains 'x'
}
```

However, this will compile:
```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  """
    x
  """ contains 'x'

  """
  """ contains 'x'
}
```
Consolidating with #4760.
(extempore in [r25459](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25459)) Fix for a bug in CharArrayReader which made triple quoted strings
fail to parse sometimes. Note: when the temptation strikes to adjust
for special cases by letting the regular case happen and subsequently
attempting to fix the ball of mutation by selectively applying what
seems like the inverse operation, please consider the possibility that
this is not the optimal approach. Closes #4785, no review.
I've add the same issue with the following code and Scala 2.9.1:

```scala
package s99

class Test {

  """
  d""" 

  """
  s"""

}
```
