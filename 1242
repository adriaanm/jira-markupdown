I've looked at the code and I think that hack should've been removed already, the case it's supposed to handle doesn't occur anymore because of improvements to `instantiateTypeParams`.  Sorry!!

Running an `ant dist` and if all goes well, will commit to trunk.

The code is now:
{code}
              val resultpe = restpe.instantiateTypeParams(tparams, targs)
              //@M substitution in instantiateParams needs to be careful!
              //@M example: class Foo[a] { def foo[m[x]]: m[a] = error("") } (new Foo[Int]).foo[List] : List[Int]
              //@M    --> first, m[a] gets changed to m[Int], then m gets substituted for List, 
              //          this must preserve m's type argument, so that we end up with List[Int], and not List[a]
              //@M related bug: SI-1438 
              //println("instantiating type params "+restpe+" "+tparams+" "+targs+" = "+resultpe)
              copy.TypeApply(tree, fun, args) setType resultpe
{code}
