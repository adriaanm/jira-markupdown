There is a serious performance issue with this approach and parallel collections: the inefficiency of the needed head/tail decomposition and partition that is used for inserting an element in an already sorted collection (at least with the parallel collections that are provided now).

What we would need to make this efficient for parallel sorting would be a collection which has the following properties:

* efficient head/tail decomposition (like List has)
* efficient insert of a single element in an already sorted collection (possibly using buckets where each bucket is responsible for the same element)
