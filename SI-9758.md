When clicking on `shouldRethrow` in the constructor param list for `Catch` the constructor parameter documentation is momentarily revealed but then as expected the page is navigated away. The parameter documentation should only expand when the click leaves the user on the page. Expanding the documentation and then leaving the page appeared to me initially as a functional defect rather than the cosmetic one it is. The UI would be better off without this confusing visual cueing.

On closer inspection this is a known issue where the target member of the link is not highlighted on arrival at the page. `shouldRethrow` is present further down the page but this is not clear without the visual cue.

The momentary disclosure of documentation on the page with the link when the link is clicked is a separate issue. Having said that the initial report in Jira is a fair account of what an occasional viewer could think happened.ï»¿ Because of this I have edited this issue to detail the lesser issue of page navigation actions also initiating documentation expansions.
