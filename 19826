{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.7 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_60).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> (".*".r findAllIn "foo").toList
res0: List[String] = List(foo, "")

scala> (".*".r findAllMatchIn "foo" map { _.matched }).toList
res1: List[String] = List(foo, "")
{code}

IMHO, the empty string at the end of each list is superfluous because the entire string has already been matched.
