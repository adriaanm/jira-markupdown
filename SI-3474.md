Before fixing SI-3224 the following worked:

{code}
def list[T](list: List[T]) = "foobar"
implicit def array2list[T](array: Array[T]) = array.toList
{code}


{code}
scala> list(Array())
res0: java.lang.String = foobar
{code}

But now this creates this error:

{code}
scala> list(Array())
<console>:8: error: polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : [T]Array[T]
 required: List[?]
       list(Array())
                 ^
{code}

Array[Nothing]() works, though (or anything else instead of Nothing).

I think this is a regression?

I guess it would have created an Array[Unit] before? That's a bit too much magic. I believe we just have to live with the regression here, or else SI-3224 is resurrected which would me much worse, IMO.
