A similar report from Akka. My working assumption is that the root cause is the same:

https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20306#issuecomment-246310523
```scala
trait MyActor { def receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] }
abstract class AkkaSpec1(_system: Any)
trait ReproTrait { self: AkkaSpec1 ⇒
  def test = {
    case object Tick

    val actor = new MyActor {
      def receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = {
        case Tick ⇒
      }
    }
    actor.receive.apply(Tick)
  }
}

object Repro extends AkkaSpec1(null) with ReproTrait {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    test
  }
}
```
