Parser accepts `override` on declarations. IMO, it should only accept `override` for definitions that actually provide a body. Although there's no runtime effect on the compiled program (AFAIK), parser should reject it for the sake of correctness. My **assumption** here is that override has no meaning if it doesn't change values' bodies.

Example for type override:

```scala
trait A { type T }
trait B extends A { override type T = Int } // should work, it's a definition
trait C extends A { override type T } // should fail here, it's a declaration
```

I feel that the parser should also fail for the declarations of `val`, `var` and `def`. The same happens for `lazy val a: Int`, which outputs `lazy values may not be abstract`. In this case, I propose to output `overriden values need to be defined`.
The override ensures that the name is correct. Abstract members can add information, and are not redundant.

```scala
trait A { type T } ; trait B extends A { type T <: Y } ; trait C extends B { override type U <: Z }

// same with value members. Nice to have override in D.

trait C { def c: Int } ; trait D extends C { val c: Int }

trait C { def c: X } ; trait D extends C { def c: Y }
```
