It's a problem in the parallel matcher, maybe a duplicate. This is what arrives at the backend:
```scala

if (temp3.apply(0).==(""))  {
                      ()
}  else {
   body%1(x){
     scala.this.Predef.println(x)
  }
}
```

Notice that the else branch flows into a label without providing a value for the parameter. Paul, can you have a look at this? I think a crash is to be preferred instead to a VerifyError. The backend can't really detect if something has been assigned to `x' or not (at least not in the current architecture).
