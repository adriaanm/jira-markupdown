[~paplorinc] - Can you check whether getOrElseUpdate is faster in your hands if the implementation is changed to the following:

{code}
    val x = get(key)
    if (x eq None) { val d = op; this(key) = d; d }
    else x.asInstanceOf[Some[V]].get
{code}

In my hands, it's full speed or faster, either when there are lots of successful lookups, or when new keys are added almost every time.
