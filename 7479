It's not possible to run partest without -deprecation.
Since detecting the warnings requires a neg test with
-Xfatal-warnings, and deprecation terminates the compile.
During a deprecation cycle, it seems necessary to test
deprecated features (e.g., warnings).

(The deprecated feature here was trait extends Kase,
where the case class is parenless.)

I tried supplying a .javaopts file to turn off the default
-deprecation, without success.  On a related note, I would
expect to be able to "scalac --deprecation=false".
