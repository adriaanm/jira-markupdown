Hi,

I can't reproduce your problem, I never get the `java.lang.Error`.

An example that should compile but does not would be good. Also give us instructions on how to reproduce it (e.g. "call javac on Test.java, then scalac on ...").

Concerning your example: defining a scala object that has the same name as a java class is not supported.
