here's the code:
```
% cat S.scala                                  
object O { Map(
  "a" -> 0, "b" -> 1, "c" -> 2, "d" -> 3, "e" -> 4,
  "a" -> 0, "b" -> 1, "c" -> 2, "d" -> 3, "e" -> 4,
  "a" -> 0, "b" -> 1, "c" -> 2, "d" -> 3, "e" -> 4,
  "f" -> 5, "g" -> 6, "h" -> 7, "i" -> 8) }
```

2.9 with -optimize likes it fine:

```
% scalac29 -version
Scala compiler version 2.9.2 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
% scalac29 -optimize S.scala
```

but with 2.10 (RC2) the inliner starts whining:

```
% scalac210 -version
Scala compiler version 2.10.0-RC2 -- Copyright 2002-2012, LAMP/EPFL
% scalac210 -optimize S.scala
warning: there were 3 inliner warnings; re-run with -Yinline-warnings for details
one warning found
% scalac210 -optimize -Yinline-warnings S.scala
warning: At the end of the day, could not inline @inline-marked method ->$extension
warning: At the end of the day, could not inline @inline-marked method ->$extension
S.scala:3: warning: At the end of the day, could not inline @inline-marked method any2ArrowAssoc
  "f" -> 5, "g" -> 6, "h" -> 7, "i" -> 8) }                                ^
three warnings found
```

The map has to be a certain length before the warnings start appearing.
one possible response is, "what, you really expect -optimize not to cause tons of warnings?"

but actually, for whatever it's worth, RC2 with -optimize compiles my entire large codebase (100K+ lines of mixed Scala and Java) with no other warnings produced besides this one (246 times). tests pass, too. so I'm thiiiiiis close to being able to use -optimize and -Xfatal-warnings. which would be pretty cool and help the optimizer get tested.

That, and the `-Xprint:cleanup` snippet below, hint at the cause of the warnings: the inlining heuristics back off after method size surpasses a threshold.

```
scala.Predef.Map().apply(
  scala.Predef.wrapRefArray(
    Array[Tuple2]{
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("a"), scala.Int.box(0)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("b"), scala.Int.box(1)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("c"), scala.Int.box(2)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("d"), scala.Int.box(3)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("e"), scala.Int.box(4)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("f"), scala.Int.box(5)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("g"), scala.Int.box(6)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("h"), scala.Int.box(7)),
      Predef$ArrowAssoc.->$extension(scala.Predef.any2ArrowAssoc("i"), scala.Int.box(8))
    }.$asInstanceOf[Array[Object]]()
  )
);
```

What happened out of this? Getting worse performance for more optimization, by itself, should **not** stop such a patch being merged.
Consider tweaking definition of `isCountable` in Scala 2.11.1: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/5wxUElooFl4/p2A1678p1XQJ
@lrytz, is there anything left to do here or can this be closed?
I am closing this. The original issue I reported is fixed. It's now perfectly safe to use the optimizer with, at least, medium-sized Map literals, the sort one might normally use in normal code.

I was able to get the new optimizer to produce the following warning, but only by cranking the size of the map up really high (thousands):

```scala
[warn] scala/Predef$ArrowAssoc$::$minus$greater$extension(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/Tuple2; is annotated @inline but could not be inlined:
[warn] The size of the callsite method O$::<init>()V
[warn] would exceed the JVM method size limit after inlining scala/Predef$ArrowAssoc$::$minus$greater$extension(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/Tuple2;.
```
