@sschaef   For the record, could you summarize in more detail why transpose shouldn't fail, and also what the "natural" expected result would be?  I can go read old mailing lists, but usually any bug that requires reading old mailing lists to understand gets such a low impact-to-effort score that I end up not getting to it at all.
