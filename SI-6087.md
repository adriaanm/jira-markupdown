Mix together the following:

mutable.HashMap[A, mutable.Set[B]]
  with mutable.MultiMap[A, B]
  with mutable.SynchronizedMap[A, mutable.Set[B]]

The SynchronizedMap trait will provide thread safety to the underlying HashMap but not to the additional behaviour added by the MultiMap. The methods MultiMap.addBinding and MultiMap.removeBinding perform get+set behaviour that is not atomic.

Possible solutions:

1. A SynchronizedMultiMap trait (attached)

Usage:

  val map = new mutable.HashMap[K, mutable.Set[V]]
      with mutable.MultiMap[K, V]
      with mutable.SynchronizedMultiMap[K, V]

2. A Built-in synchronization for SynchronizedMap

Doesn't seem to be done in any of the other mutable collections
Relates to the broader issues of SI-4290
