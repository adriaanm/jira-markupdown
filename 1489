From the file header of class `scala.xml.NamespaceBinding` one can read:
{code}
/** The class <code>NamespaceBinding</code> represents namespace bindings
 *  and scopes. The binding for the default namespace is treated as a null
 *  prefix. the absent namespace is represented with the null uri. Neither
 *  prefix nor uri may be empty, which is not checked.
 *
 *  @author  Burak Emir
 *  @version 1.0
 */
{code}
That means that with the current implementation of `NamespaceBinding` the uri may not be empty *and* is not checked.
