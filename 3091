You can find lots of messages from me over the last year pointing out that this is a problem.  Special casing that one specific exception is a non-starter.  More plausible is special casing scala.util.control.ControlException, from which that and others are derived.  However that's not a very good solution either.

I want to make case e => or case _ => ... compile time errors.  If you really want to catch Throwable (which you basically never should) you would have to say case e: Throwable.  However before I would push for that I really need to get scala.util.control.Exception into a more finished state.

By the way I put a warning in to complain about these a while ago.
```scala
% scala -Ywarn-catches

scala> // your code here

<console>:14: warning: catch clause swallows everything: not advised.
               case e => {
               ^
```
