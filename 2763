I think this is a bug in the pattern matcher, because of which c's type is not propagated properly

changing the line to
```scala
      case Some((c: Class[_ <: Base])) => run(c)
```

results in:
```scala
/Users/adriaan/git/scala/test/pending/pos/t2635.scala:12: error: not found: type _$$3
      case Some((c: Class[_ <: Base])) => run(c)
```

this was probably an existing bug that was unmasked by the fix for scala/bug#513
