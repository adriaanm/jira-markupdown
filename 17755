In paragraph 1.3.5 of the Scala 2.9 specification, it explicitly says that {{'\u000A'}} is not a valid literal.

But the following compiles without error, produce the 'expected' output.

{code}
object CharLiteral {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("aa" + '\u000A' + "bb")
  }
}
{code}

output:

{code}
aa
bb
{code}

To be complete, the following compiles and runs fine too:

{code}
object CharLiteral {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("aa" + '
' + "bb")
  }
}
{code}


My whole system is configured with UTF-8, so I don't expect this to be an encoding problem.
