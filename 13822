Mouse Wheel scrolling usually work in Swing by default. In my application I encountered a case where it seemed to be disabled. Attached a simple demonstration. 

In order for MouseWheel events to work properly it is essential that components embedded in a scrollable view port *not* register listeners for mouse wheel events. Then the events propagate up the container hierarchy. 

It seems to me that the Mouse object in Component registers these listeners whenever any Mouse fields are initialized.
