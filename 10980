Some of the computationally intensive things in my code run in parallel and use reflection. I can't really seem to find a way around using reflection and I'm stuck with Scala 2.10 for the moment. I'm investigating how soon my dependencies can upgrade to 2.11, but until then, it's a problem. In scala/bug#6240, others have wished for a back port but I'm not sure if the demand still exists.
