The following snippet (run as a script, in the interpreter, or with the appropriate wrapper to be compiled) crashes the compiler in both 2.7.1 and the latest nightly:
{code}
{ () =>
	case class Foo
	case class Bar extends Foo
	Bar
	()
}
{code}

Making either Foo or Bar not a case class removes the crash.

Incidentally, removing the () from the end of the function creates another, distinct, crash, which JamesIry is reporting separately.
