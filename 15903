= problem =
When converting code-bases as a proof of concept it is often necessary to have some working code after a short time. Having no mutable sorted implementations of Map is a big obstacle, because it forces code using it to be rewritten (which might make sense in a later step though) and makes it hard to argue that Scala is a good upgrade path from Java.

= analysis =
immutable.TreeMap exists but mutable implementation is missing in Scala's standard library.

= enhancement recommendation =
Scala should ship with support for this data structure.
