```scala
  val s = Stream.from(1)
  s.take(2).foreach(_ => ())
  println(s)   // prints  Stream(1, 1, ?) (should be Stream(1, 2, ?), as it is in Scala 2.11.5)

  val s = Stream.from(1)
  s.take(2).foreach(_ => ())
  s.tail.head  // prints 2, which is correct
```

Let me know if I need to do any corrections or if this is a duplicate(searched but found no similar issue reported).
