That `contains` does not take objects of type `A`:

{code}
    def contains(elem: Any): Boolean = exists (_ == elem)
{code}

Why doesn't `Set.contains` also take `Any`? Probably historical reasons + `contains` is used much more often with a `Set` than with a `Seq`, so type-safety is more desirable.
