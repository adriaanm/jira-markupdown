The attached patch does two things: 

(a) print more concise error messages for -Yrangepos when -Ydebug 

(b) skip throwing a ValidateException

In some cases that's just what one needs (e.g., the plugin jdk2ikvm which stops after typer). -Yrangepos may still cause other exceptions to be thrown after typer has run. 

Let me know what you think!
