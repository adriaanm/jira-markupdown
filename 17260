All warnings beyond the first to the same position are silently dropped.  Since they may be about unrelated matters, this is less than ideal.  Martin says:
{noformat}
What we could do:

1) there may only be one error reported in any position
2) If an error is reported in a position no warning can be reported in
the same position
3) if there is no error reported in some position, any number of
warnings may be reported in that position.
{noformat}
This would certainly solve the problem for me - my concern is with the set of warnings issued on successful compilation runs (which are likely to be inferred by the user to be the complete set of normal warnings.)
