Differing Scaladoc tool behavior for arguments with/without a specified argument default value.  An issue of Scaladoc and a defined argument's default value.  

Testing was done under "Scala-2.8.0.RC3".  Code segment and execution log are attached.

Code Segments:

    * Quad_One contains a "/*" comment and argument/default value " Double = 0. ".
    * Quad_Two contains a "/**" comment and argument/default value " Double = 0. ".
    * Quad_Three contains a "/**" comment and argument " Double " w/o a default value.

Results differ:

    * 1st code segment: Compiles without error and produces anticipated Scaladoc output.
    * 2nd code segment: Compiles without error and does NOT produce Scaladoc output.
    * 3rd code segment: Compiles without error and produces anticipated Scaladoc output.

Is the need for removal the argument's default needed for proper Scaladoc execution?
Could not reproduce due to example referencing unavailable libraries. Most likely a duplicate of #3571 (which is now closed).
