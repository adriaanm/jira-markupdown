The following macro throws a VerifyError when run.  Variations on the error are possible.  There need to be enough cases to cause a lookupswitch to be generated.
{code}
import scala.reflect.makro.Context
import language.experimental.macros

object Macros {
  def m(): Unit = macro m_impl
  def m_impl(c: Context)(): c.Expr[Unit] = {
    import c.universe._
    def f(ch: Char): Any = ch match {
      case 'b' | 'B'                               => 1
      case 'c' | 'C'                               => 2
      case 'd' | 'u' | 'i' | 'o' | 'x' | 'X' | 'c' => 3
      case 'f' | 'e' | 'E' | 'g' | 'G'             => 4
      case 'h' | 'H'                               => 5
      case 's'                                     => 6
      case _                                       => 7
    }
    List('a') foreach f
    c.Expr[Unit](Block(Literal(Constant(()))))
  }
}
{code}
{code}
object Test extends App { Macros.m() }

Ha ha ha, classic.  Macros have nothing to do with anything, it's just when you're writing your first macro you tend to blame macros for the verify errors.

This is more than sufficient:
{code}

object Test {
  def f(ch: Char): Any = ch match {
    case 'b' | 'B'                               => 1
    case 'c' | 'C'                               => 2
    case 'd' | 'u' | 'i' | 'o' | 'x' | 'X' | 'c' => 3
    case 'f' | 'e' | 'E' | 'g' | 'G'             => 4
    case 'h' | 'H'                               => 5
    case 's'                                     => 6
    case _                                       => 7
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    f('a')
  }
}
{code}

A-ha.  Minimized.
{code}
object Test {
  def f(ch: Char): Any = ch match {
    case 'a' | 'b' => 1
    case 'z' | 'a' => 1
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = f('a')
}
{code}

The offending bytecode instruction is:

{noformat}
   3:	lookupswitch{ //4
		97: 63;
		97: 56;
		98: 63;
		122: 56;
		default: 44 }
{noformat}

The list of int pair {{(match, offset)}} as per the JVMS "must be sorted in increasing numerical order by match." 

The problem above is the duplicate {{match}} value (97) which results from {{'a'}} matching two different case clauses (the second is unreachable for that value).

The backend can silently swallow duplicate {{match}} values but given they're constants, the error could be signalled earlier.


What GenASM can do (all it can do) about this is showcased in the third commit of https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/841 , ie in [4cca17da5c5236c23e32c0a3298e4a097e335a0c | https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/commit/4cca17da5c5236c23e32c0a3298e4a097e335a0c]
I don't know if I should file a separate ticket, but the same happens with the following correct code:

{code}
object Test {
  var cond = false
  
  def f(ch: Char): Any = ch match {
    case 'a' if cond => 1
    case 'z' | 'a' => 2
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = f('a')
}
{code}
I'm looking into fixing this, but it's a bit involved...

Technically, it depends on the granularity of the reachable entities you're considering.
The current implementation considers reachability per case, and `f('z')` will reach the case we think of as unreachable.

I'm trying to figure out how to consider reachability per alternative, but that's tricky to describe in general. What if you have several nested alternatives (inside other patterns) in one case?

I also just opened an unreachability ticket this morning.  SI-6048
> I'm trying to figure out how to consider reachability per alternative, but that's tricky to describe in general. What if you have several nested alternatives (inside other patterns) in one case?

What deters you from expanding all the alternatives up front? This was something the old matcher did which I thought was approximately correct: copy patterns around until alternatives are gone.

A variation of this bug persisted, but has been fixed along with SI-6902
