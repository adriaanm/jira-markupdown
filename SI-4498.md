=== What steps will reproduce the problem  ===
```scala
  io.Position.column(io.Position.encode(1,2)) 
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

should return `2`

=== What do you see instead? ===

returns `1`

=== Additional information ===

Method [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/io/Position.scala?rev=24717#L48 encode] does not use column parameter.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: nightly scala-2.10.0.r24777-b20110419020105
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_21
  - Operating system: Win 7 
So you mean that where it says "{{math.min(LINE_MASK, line)}}" below, 

```scala
  /** Encodes a position into a single integer. */
  final def encode(line: Int, column: Int): Int = {
    checkInput(line, column)
    
    if (line >= LINE_MASK)
      LINE_MASK << COLUMN_BITS
    else
      (line << COLUMN_BITS) | math.min(LINE_MASK, line)
  }
```

is should say "{{math.min(COLUMN_MASK, column)}}" ?

Would that work? But given that you know best your test cases, please let me know if that will do.

Yes, I believe that:
```scala
  final def encode(line: Int, column: Int): Int = {
    checkInput(line, column)
    
    if (line >= LINE_MASK)
      LINE_MASK << COLUMN_BITS
    else
      (line << COLUMN_BITS) | math.min(COLUMN_MASK, column)
  }
```
would be correct.

The old cold before r24717 used:
```scala
if (column > COLUMN_MASK)
  column1 = COLUMN_MASK
    else 
  column1 = column
```
and encoded with `column1`.

I think Paul who committed r24717 would be able to quickly confirm whether this was a typo.

I'm attaching a sample test that shows that 2.8.0 to 2.9.RC1 return `1:5` as position of the error while r24777 returns `1:1`
(In r24835) Fixed a booch I made in io.Position's positioning.
Closes #4498, no review.
