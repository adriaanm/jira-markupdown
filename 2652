As an addendum, the {{==}} equality cannot return true in any case, as that would invalidate IEEE-754 floating point semantics. That would make the language virtually unusable (incompatible with 754) for scientific computations, so that's a non-option in any case.

Either {{Float.equals}} needs to return false, which would put it at odds with Java, or {{==}} and {{equals}} have to be different. As Paul mentioned, the latter is the current choice.
