I've come across a typo in the Implicit Parameters section of Scala Language Specification, version 2.7. In page 99, section 7.2:

{code}
def sort{A](xs: List[A])(implicit a2ordered: A => Ordered[A]) = ...
{code}

I think it should be something like this:

{code}
def sort[A](xs: List[A])(implicit a2ordered: A => Ordered[A]) = ...
{code}




I agree, "sort{A]" should read "sort[A]". The 2.8 spec exhibits thay typo in Sec. 7.2, page 107. 

While we're at the 2.8 spec, a phrase appears duplicated on the 2nd paragraph of Ch. 2 (page 15), where it reads: 
"Bindings of different kinds have a precedence defined on them: Bindings of different kinds have a precedence defined on them"

One more typo? The LaTeX command \commadots appears verbatim on p. 77 (first paragraph in Sec. 6.6)

(In r21977) Fixed ""sort{A]", duplicate sentence, and
the commadots as well (apart from the one
on p.77 there was another one on p.98).
Closes SI-3388.
