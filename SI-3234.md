Compiling the following with -optimize
```scala
class Base {
  @inline def foo(n: Int) = n
}

object Test extends Base {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println(foo(42))
  }
}
```
yields
```scala
test2.scala:7: warning: Could not inline required method foo because bytecode was not available.
    println(foo(42))
               ^
```
which is rather strange this since foo is defined right there.

Here's the relevant piece of -Ydebug -Ylog:inliner output:
```scala
[log inliner] CALL_METHOD TestBase.foo (dynamic) has actual receiver: singleton class Test
[log inliner] 	looked up method: Base.foo
[log inliner] shouldLoad: singleton class Test.method foo
[log inliner] Treating CALL_METHOD TestBase.foo (dynamic)
	receiver: singleton class Test
	icodes.available: true
	concreteMethod.isEffectivelyFinal: false
test2.scala:7: warning: Could not inline required method foo because bytecode was not available.
    println(foo(42))
               ^
[log inliner] could not find icode
	receiver: singleton class Test
	method: method foo
```

Also, shouldn't concreteMethod.isEffectivelyFinal be true? After all the receiver is a singleton object, ergo its class final. Declaring foo final doesn't change the behavior, though.
This makes the debugging output pretty confusing, though it won't help much as it turns out:
```scala
"\n\tconcreteMethod.isEffectivelyFinal: " + concreteMethod.isFinal
```
Fixing that it still says false, because Base is the symbol's owner.

BTW this does make it inline:
```scala
  override def foo(n: Int) = super.foo(n)
```
Does seem like it should behave the same with or without that override.
After spending all day today cozy with the inliner, I can't help but know what's up with this ticket.  What I don't know is what the intention is.  As an illustration of what the problem is and not a proposed implementation, here's a small diff which makes this test case work.
```scala
-    def lookupIMethod(meth: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Option[IMethod] =
-      icodes.icode(receiver).get lookupMethod meth
+    def lookupIMethod(meth: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Option[IMethod] = {
+      val target = icodes.icode(receiver).get
+      
+      (target lookupMethod meth) orElse lookupIMethod(meth, target.symbol.superClass)
+    }
```
(In r22335) The inliner now looks harder for method implementations.  In addition
to the receiver, it will find those in directly mixed in traits and in
superclasses.  It still won't find those in traits mixed only into
superclasses, as that didn't come quite so easily.  Closes #3234 but
I'll be opening up another ticket.  Review by dragos.
