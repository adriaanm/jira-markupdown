The MultiMap does not clear bindings when there are no longer values at a given key. For example, the following code prints true:
{code}
import collection.mutable._
val m = new HashMap[Int, Set[String]] with MultiMap[Int, String]
m.addBinding(6, "London")
m.removeBinding(6, "London")
m.contains(6)
{code}

There are 2 problems here: firstly there is a memory leak in that it is impossible to remove these empty sets and secondly the MultiMap reports (erroneously) that it contains mappings for the given Key, which it does not.
 
I believe the body of the removeBinding method should look like the following:

{code}
  def removeBinding(key: A, value: B): this.type = {
    get(key) match {
      case None =>
        case Some(set) => set -= value; if (set.isEmpty) this -= key
    }
    this
  }
{code}

When providing the bug report can you please make sure that things mentioned here: http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala#Reportinganissue are included ? For example here you are missing version number and correct formatting (which I will do for you this time).

This happens in r20248.
