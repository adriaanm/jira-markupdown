scala.concurrent.SyncVar[A] does, in principle, support throwing an exception on `.get`.

However, the only possible way to set the exception to be thrown seems to be SyncVar's method
```scala
    private def setException(e: Throwable)
```

Since it is private (and not used anywhere inside SyncVar), I can see no way to set the Exception at all.

Proposal: make SyncVar.setException public.
