scala.concurrent.SyncVar[A] does, in principle, support throwing an exception on {{.get}}.

However, the only possible way to set the exception to be thrown seems to be SyncVar's method

{code}
    private def setException(e: Throwable)
{code}

Since it is private (and not used anywhere inside SyncVar), I can see no way to set the Exception at all.

Proposal: make SyncVar.setException public.
