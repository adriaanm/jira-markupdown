There are four key optimizations that Mondrian's optimizer could make but doesn't.

Mondrian's optimizer is smart enough to turn {{if (true) a else b}} into {{a}}.  To my delight, it is smart enough to do this even if {{true}} is inside a {{final val}} and not the literal {{true}}.  This zeroth-order optimization is very helpful.

However, Mondrian's optimizer misses several key first-order optimizations that are quite useful.

* true  || x == true
* false && y == false
* true  && x == x
* false || y == y
* x &&  true == x
* y || false == y

Unfortunately, you have to be careful with the two remaining cases unless you can prove that {{x}} & {{y}} are side-effect free.

* x || true  == {x; true}
* y && false == {y; false}

This is something that is pretty easy to encounter in performance-critical cases where you don't really want to have to rely on the JIT optimizer to be smart enough.

{noformat}
  class {
    final val extremeLogs = false
    for (tightLoop) {
      if (extremeLogs && logger.isTraceEnabled) { ... }
      ...
    }
  }
{noformat}

One would hope that the optimizer would actually be smart enough to recurse through boolean expressions and apply these transformations from the outside in.  There are also some additional safe transformations like {{x && true && y == x && y}}.  
This is supported by the experimental optimizer that eventually will replace the current one.
