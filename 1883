sorry the formatting was wrong:
```scala
scala> object D { def ?: [T](block: => T) = { println("In D"); block } }
defined module D

scala> foo() ?: D                                                       
foo
In D
res5: Int = 5

scala> D.?:(foo())                                                      
In D
foo
res6: Int = 5
```
