=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
When running scalac on the file below:

========= ReturnTest.scala ===========
object ReturnTest {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Value of test: " + test)
  }

  def test: String = {
    try {
      "ABC"
      throw new Exception("Whatever.")
    } catch {
      case e: Exception =>
        "DEF"
    } finally {
      "GHI"
    }
  }
}
======================================

I get the following message:
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException 
 - klass: 'java/lang/ClassNotFoundException'
#
# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:
#
#  Internal Error (exceptions.cpp:367), pid=8196, tid=5620

This occurs with 2.9.0.RC1, and doesn't occur with 2.8.1.final.  It also does not happen on Ubuntu 10.4, but on Windows XP.  It occurs with both scalac and fsc.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The source file should be compiled to .class files.


=== What do you see instead? ===
The error message, shown above. The log file referenced above is attached.

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC1
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Windows XP Professional, Version 2002, Service Pack 3
I have one thing to add. This is happening under Cygwin bash shell, and not under cmd.exe. The value of important environment variables:

SCALA_HOME=/opt/scala (equates to C:\opt\scala)[[BR]]
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_24 (equates to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24)[[BR]]
PATH=/home/e69425/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_24/bin:/windows:/windows/System32/Wbem:/windows/system32:/windows/system32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0:/opt/apache-maven-3.0.2/bin:/opt/sbt/bin:/opt/scala/bin ...[[BR]]

I added 'set -x' at the beginning of scalac and ran it (for verbose echoing of lines executed), and I notice something. Here's the command to execute the compiler (with no arguments):

{code}
/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.6.0_24/bin/java -Xmx256M -Xms32M '-Xbootclasspath/a:C:/opt/scala/lib/jline.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/mscorlib.dll;C:/opt/scala/lib/predef.dll;C:/opt/scala/lib/scala-compiler.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/scala-dbc.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/scala-library.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/scala-partest.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/scala-swing.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/scalap.jar;C:/opt/scala/lib/scalaruntime.dll' -Dscala.usejavacp=true -Dscala.home=C:/opt/scala -Denv.emacs= -Djline.terminal=jline.UnixTerminal scala.tools.nsc.Main
{code}

There are three DLLs appended to the boot classpath -- mscorblib.dll, predef.dll, and scalaruntime.dll!  When I remove these from the boot classpath, it no longer crashes, but prints out this:

{code}
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/tools/nsc/Main
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: scala.tools.nsc.Main
        at java.net.URLClassLoader$$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202)
        ...
{code}

Perhaps the JVM isn't verifying that the files on the boot classpath are jar files? But even without the DLLs, something else is happening to cause it to miss the compiler class.

By the way, the scalac.bat script is passing a lot more option processing on to the scala.tools.nsc.Main class. Why isn't the Unix version doing this?
