I am using the Beta plugin of 2008/07/06 on Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede).

Scala objects with main methods are not detected as valid entry points.

To demonstrate this:

 * Open a scala project that has entry point classes in it.
 * Go to the eclipse "Debug Configurations" window
 * Create a new Scala Application configuration
 * Click "Search..." in the "Main class" box.

Your entry points will not be listed.

If you enter the complete class name (including the package) of the main class, it will execute just fine.

I have not tested this on Eclipse 3.3, so this may be a 3.4 specific problem.
Duplicate of #112.
