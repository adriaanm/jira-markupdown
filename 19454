Addendum to scala/bug#9006, instead of merely making the links to companions more obvious, combine the trait/class and companion object into a single page with anchor tags to retain the current navigation but also improve the experience, allowing Ctrl-F to find a method on the page in either class/trait or companion, and also show the companion when simply browsing through the page.
