Your analysis is spot on, Jens. I'd actually started a patch for this last week: https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.11.x...retronym:ticket/8831?expand=1

In the commit comment, I describe the rationale for `startsWith`; the case accessor method for a non-public case class parameter `a` is mangled to a name like `a$1`. This itself is problematic, as it is leads to fragile binary compatibility. The 2.12.x branch uses a more structured name for these mangled `a$accessor$1`.

I'll make sure we fix this before 2.11.7. Until then, the workaround is to avoid using case class param names that start with `someOtherParamName$`.
