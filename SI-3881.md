This minor annoyance was reported a while back on the scala-user mailing list (http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/XMLEventReader-and-large-XML-file-tp1956916p1956916.html). 

XMLEventReader provides a stop method which is supposed to stop the parser thread, but that currently does not work.
(In r23251) Fixing issue with XMLEventReader.stop failing to stop the parser thread.
Contributed by Jean-Laurent Huynh, reviewed by extempore.  Closes SI-3881.
