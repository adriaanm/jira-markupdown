There may be obstacles, but here is the kind of improvement I was holding out for.
{code}
implicit def compareComparables[T](x: T)(implicit ord: Ordering[T]): Ordering[T]#Ops = new ord.Ops(x)
{code}
With that we're down to
{code}
def testOrderingCtx[T: Ordering](a: T, b: T) = a < b
{code}
Hard to beat.
