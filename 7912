The spec is actually bit lacking in this area. This is syntactically allowed, but there is no mention on how it should be type checked. Is {{((Animal*) => Any)}} a subtype of {{((Dog*) => Any)}}? Of {{Seq[Animal] => Any}}? 

All we are told is that:
```
The type of such a repeated parameter inside the method is then the sequence type scala.Seq[T].
```

By name parameters are similarly underspecced.
