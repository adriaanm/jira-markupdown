Created and compiled class:
```scala
abstract class B {
  protected def println(): Unit
}
```
Javap shows for me: 

```java
public abstract class B implements scala.ScalaObject {
  public abstract void println();
  public B();
}
```
I expected protected access modifier for method println.
More interestingly, `protected\[this\]` also creates a public method. `protected` alone has to because it's less restrictive than `protected` in Java / on the JVM.
