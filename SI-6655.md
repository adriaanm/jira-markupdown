Parameter names are lost after specialization (in specialized overrides). For example, when debugging inside a closure that was specialized they show up in the debugger as `v$1..v$n`.

The following code:

```scala
class Foo {
  val f = (param: Int) => param
}
```

generates the following anonymous function (trees after specialization):

```scala
final <synthetic> class $anonfun extends scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1[Int,Int] with Serializable {
  def this(): anonymous class $anonfun = {
    $anonfun.super.this();
    ()
  };
  final def apply(param: Int): Int = $anonfun.this.apply$mcII$sp(param);
  <specialized> def apply$mcII$sp(v1: Int): Int = v1 //!! notice v1
};
```
