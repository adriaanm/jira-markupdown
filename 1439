I'm willing to test with 2.7.3RC1 despite my fear of breaking the current install that is working well enough. But when I do: Help > Software Update.. > Update.. I get the following mistake:
```scala
An error occurred while collecting items to be installed
  No repository found containing: ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core/osgi.bundle/2.7.3.RC1
  No repository found containing: ch.epfl.lamp.sdt/org.eclipse.update.feature/2.7.3.RC1
  No repository found containing: scala.library/osgi.bundle/2.7.3.RC1
  No repository found containing: scala.tools.nsc/osgi.bundle/2.7.3.RC1
```

I've had this before, and ended up wrecking the whole enve trying to fix this. How do I correct this.
