there's quite a mess when it comes to the symbol for such a class (only in separate
compilation). there are four (!)

 - one ClassSymbol created during Erasure / AddInterfaces

 - one ClassSymbol created by the ClassPath, because the "A$class.class" file exists
 - one ModuleSymbol, also created due to the classfile
 - one ModuleClassSymbol, also created due to the classfile


i observed at least two issues:

- AddInterfaces "unlinks" the existing ClassSymbol from the "owner.info.decls". The
   intention is good, but i think it's not good enough.
   a. it should also unlink the symbols for module and the moduleClass.
   b. i think we have a general problem when it comes to un-linking: it removes a symbol only from the scope of the current type, but not all types in the typeHistory. This seems to be a real problem because the supposedly unlinked symbol comes back / is found during ICodeReader
- ClassfileParser is confused because the (bytecode) methods in implementation classes
    static, so it thinks the symbol for the method found in the moduleClass.
