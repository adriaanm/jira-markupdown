[~ichoran]: As you say, it is reasonable to assume the predicate test to be simpler/faster than the map lookup. Doesn't that imply nonetheless that the operands of the short-circuited {{&&}} in {{contains}} *should* be swapped? Note that this would, as a side effect, also fix the inconsistency that {{contains\(x)}} does not fail when {{get\(x)}} does, if the filter predicate is undefined for {{x}} (they will then both fail, which is reasonable).
