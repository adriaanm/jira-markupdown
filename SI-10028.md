[Each](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/each) is a library that depends on Scalaz. When I run `sbt doc`, it creates [documentation alone with package objects from Scalaz](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/com/thoughtworks/each/each_2.12/3.1.1/each_2.12-3.1.1-javadoc.jar/!/index.html). I expect it only contains the API from source code, not from libraries.
