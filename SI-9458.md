The compiler sometimes allows access to members of inaccessible types (note {{protected}}):

{noformat}
scala> object A { protected class C { def x = 1 }; val c = new C }
defined object A

scala> A.c.x
res3: Int = 1
{noformat}

but sometimes prohibits constructing such a situation entirely (note {{private}}):

{noformat}
scala> object C { private class D; val d = new D }
<console>:10: error: private class D escapes its defining scope as part of type C.D
       object C { private class D; val d = new D }
{noformat}

I cannot find any language in the specification that actually addresses this directly. In the absence of such language, I don't see any justification for the latter error.

Both 2012 threads ended without any real resolution.

In the 2015 thread, @retronym notes that Java forbids even the {{protected}} version (and he quotes explicit language in the JLS specifying that). It's unclear where this difference between Scala and Java is accidental or intentional. The fact that scalac forbids the {{private}} version outright suggests to me that the lack of corresponding language in the SLS is an oversight.
