from Seq.scala in the standard library:
{code}
  /** Returns the last element of this list.
   *
   *  @return the last element of the list.
   *  @throws Predef.UnsupportedOperationException if the list is empty.
   */
  def last: A = length match {
    case 0 => throw new Predef.NoSuchElementException
    case n => this(n - 1)
  }
{code}
the doc says UnsupportedOperationException but the code says NoSuchElementException.
(seems to me like the doc should be changed to match the code, rather than vice versa)
