doh.

well, I'm tempted to suggest the empty parameter lists be removed from the synthetic methods. it seems like the right thing from the user's perspective. but I can easily imagine it wouldn't really be worth tinkering with.

I could put the patch to Any.scala and AnyRef.scala together if you like. I'm in there anyway, documenting.
