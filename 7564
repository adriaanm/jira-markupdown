So they will both be members, with the same name? If I "foo member bar" I get an overloaded symbol with both the field and the getter? I do not think that will end well; at the least it will require changing a ton of code to consider alternatives or add a suchThat in order to filter out the field.
```scala
scala> res0.info.member("field": TermName)
res5: $r.intp.global.Symbol = method field

scala> res0.info.member("field ": TermName)
res6: $r.intp.global.Symbol = variable field
```
