Related to SI-425 and SI-816.  You can infer from their long lifetimes that they haven't gone down easy.  I unraveled the pattern matcher quite a ways but not yet far enough.  Actually if you look in ParallelMatching you will see from the following commented out block that I might be close:
{code}
            // The below fixes bugs 425 and 816 with only the small downside
            // of causing 60 other tests to fail.
            // case _ =>
            //   if (erased_xIsaY || xIsaY && !isDef)  (alts(EmptyTree, pat), subs, None) // never =:= for <equals>
            //   else if (isDef)                       (EmptyTree,           dummy, pass)
            //   else                                  (None,                 None, pass)
{code}
...but I've been working on other stuff.
