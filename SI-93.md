Typically the first thing I do when I start an interpreter session is to :load a script containing a pile of imports and a few other bits. It would be good to be able to specify that script on the command line, e.g. Python and Lua provide this with the -i switch.
Lex's comments on the issue:

Let me try and summarize.  After changing -i as you suggest, and assuming
-e makes the cut, we would have the following command-line patterns:

scala { scalac-opt }  [ -i { preload file} ]
scala { scalac-opt }  [ -e expression ] { argument }
scala { scalac-opt }  [ -howtorun:script ]  scriptfile  { argument }
scala { scalac-opt }  [ -howtorun:object ]  object  { argument }


Cleaning this up, I like the look of the following:

scala { scalac-opt }  [ -interact { preload-file} ]
scala { scalac-opt }  [ -eval expression ] { argument }
scala { scalac-opt }  [ -script ]  scriptfile  { argument }
scala { scalac-opt }  [ -object ]  object  { argument }

We could also allow -i, -e, and -s as short versions of -interact, -eval,
and -script.
