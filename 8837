Aha! Interesting. Thanks for explaining, Miguel.

Do you have any suggestions for creating a test that could validate that the change does not break existing behaviour?

Also, even if the method *is*, in fact, called, is it necessary that the behaviour differ from the actual runtime behaviour of Int unboxing?
