Hi plocinic,

I don't see any obvious similarities except that the steps that you have to take to reproduce this bug are a superset of the steps that reproduce SI-2581. The phrase "no error appears because of SI-2581" that appears in the bug report is there to prevent the developer from focusing on the anomaly that is created as a result of step 3 (missing error message) and focus on the anomaly that is the result of step 4 (bogus error message). Sorry If I am not clear enough and caused any confusion.

If this is not the case then please comment on how this bug and scala/bug#2581 are related.
