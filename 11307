I'm still not quite following the motivation.

In your original code:

{code}
trait A{ trait Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
val b: B = new B{}
val a: A = b
new b.Foo with a.Foo
{code}

Why didn't you just write:

{code}
new b.Foo
{code}

given that `B#Foo` already extends `A#Foo`?
