I'm still not quite following the motivation.

In your original code:
```scala
trait A{ trait Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
val b: B = new B{}
val a: A = b
new b.Foo with a.Foo
```

Why didn't you just write:
```scala
new b.Foo
```

given that `B#Foo` already extends `A#Foo`?
