SyncVar has overloads of get with and without timeout.  take only has a no-timeout overload.  Adding one with timeout would be trivial, I think:

  def take(timeout: Long) = synchronized {
    try get(timeout)
    finally unset()
  }
Good suggestion, added in [ce896d6|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/ce896d6531122410659492c07926a0a293b94afa]
