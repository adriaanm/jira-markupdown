... we could do this by refining `inferExprAlternative` to discard alternatives that require arguments, when in QUALmode (since we'd be in FUNmode if an application followed, or in EXPRmode if we can deal with converting a method reference to a function -- QUALmode, as I understand it, excludes that)
