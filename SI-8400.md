The following is Test.scala

object Test {

  private val shutdownHook = sys.addShutdownHook(shutdown())

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    (1 to 100) foreach {i  => println(i); Thread.sleep(1000)}
  }

  def shutdown() {
    println("Shutting down.")
  }

}

Running the follwing returns:
$ scalac -Ywarn-unused Test.scala
Test.scala:3: warning: private val in object Test is never used
  private val shutdownHook = sys.addShutdownHook(shutdown())
              ^

However, letting the program run to completion prints out "Shutting down" as does killing the program with ^C and ^Z.

Further, the following code compiled with the above flag now has two warnings.

object Test2 {

  private val shutdownHook = sys.addShutdownHook(shutdown())
  private var bool = true

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    (1 to 100) foreach {i  => println(i); Thread.sleep(1000)}
  }

  def shutdown() {
    bool = false
    println("Shutting down.")
  }

}

$scalac -Ywarn-unused Test2.scala
Test.scala:3: warning: private val in object Test2 is never used
  private val shutdownHook = sys.addShutdownHook(shutdown())
              ^
Test.scala:4: warning: private var in object Test2 is never used
  private var bool = true
              ^

Perhaps this is me misunderstanding how the compiler works with the JVM, but it feels wrong nonetheless.
I think the diagnosis is correct, that there is a misunderstanding.

The warning is just saying that the variable shutdownHook is not read.  Maybe you forgot to do something useful with it:

{code}
      if (i > 50) { Console println s"Unhooking: ${shutdownHook.remove()}" ; sys exit 0 }
{code}

The excellent ScalaDoc notes: "The hook is automatically registered: the returned value can be ignored."  That is, you don't need to hold the reference.

If this is not a bug, then it could be a feature improvement for the compiler to not warn against it. The following will properly catch a ^C and shutdown in a way that allows all the futures to finish. I feel that this is useful and not an "unused val." Yet compiling warns against it.

{code}
object Test {

  import scala.concurrent.Future
  import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
  import scala.collection.mutable

  private val shutdownHook = sys.addShutdownHook(shutdown())
  private var shouldRun = true
  private var workers = new mutable.HashSet[Future[Long]]
  private var lastCompletedWorker = 0L
  private lazy val SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT = 3000L

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    receive()
  }

  private def receive(): Unit = {

    workers += Future {
      Thread.sleep(1000)
      val t = System.currentTimeMillis
      println(t)
      t
    }
    println("Workers: " + workers.size)
    lazy val completed = workers.filter(_.isCompleted)

    if (completed.size > 0) lastCompletedWorker = System.currentTimeMillis

    workers --= completed
    Thread.sleep(100)
    if (shouldRun) receive()
  }

  private def shutdown() {
    println("Shutting down")
    shouldRun = false
    while (workers.size > 0 && System.currentTimeMillis - lastCompletedWorker < SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT) {
      // do nothing
    }
    println("Workers done")
  }

}
{code}
Aside from the lack of thread safety, the example works without the private member, which is in fact unused in the code, like the warning says.  You can add the hook without the assignment.

But if you did need to hold a reference (to avoid garbage collection), it would be nice to have a way to turn off the warning; see other tix about turning off warnings, or let's call it "tuning" warnings.

Besides the thread safety between the hook and receive, there's also a race because you set the hook before initializing everything else. (In an object, with the init run from static block, maybe there's a guarantee about the hook not running?)
