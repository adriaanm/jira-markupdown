The exponent is applied during type parameter inference.  If you wish to work around:
{code}
// All the expressions which look like this
def ~[A21](m3:M[A21]) = new CanBuild21(canBuild(m1,m2),m3)
// Should instead be generated like this
def ~[A21](m3:M[A21]) = new CanBuild21[A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A18, A19, A20, A21](canBuild(m1,m2),m3)
{code}
Then the problem will go away.
