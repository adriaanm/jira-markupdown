I see the relation to SI-4403, although the comment by [~extempore] seems to indicate that there's no intention to fix this issue, which is a problem, as I see it, since the compiler generates invalid bytecode.

SI-4214 seems to have been resolved if you look at the comment from the original reporter, but nowhere do I see a reference to a solution that resolves the primitive generic type issue.

I've linked this issue to the "metabug" SI-4912, I hope to see a fix soon, and I would love to hear from [~extempore] why there's not much that can be done about it.
