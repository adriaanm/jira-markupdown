(extempore in [r25453|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25453]) Don't want to chase NPEs around for the rest of my life. Created
"NoCompilationUnit" and "NoSourceFile" objects to represent not-present
versions of these items. Seems a lot better than null. References
scala/bug#4859, got past NPE only to uncover the actual problem. No review.
