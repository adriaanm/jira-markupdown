Yes, this very weird, and we don't all get the same results: from my location, I can't even download the jar directly, while apparently you can (different mirrors...).

As a workaround, you can have it download from Sonatype with (in build.sbt):
{code}
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
{code}
