Subclassing {{annotation.ClassfileAnnotation}} ...

{code}
class Foo extends annotation.ClassfileAnnotation
{code}

... emits the following, misleading warning:

{code}
Implementation restriction: subclassing Classfile does not make your
annotation visible at runtime. If that is what you want,
you must write the annotation class in Java.
{code}

A) Um yes? ... That's exactly as intended. That's why the class is called {{ClassfileAnnotation}} and not {{RuntimeAnnotation}}.
B) The class is called {{ClassfileAnnotation}}, not {{Classfile}}.

If we had a non-functional {{RuntimeAnnotation}} somewhere in the library, the warning would make sense, but like this, it doesn't.
