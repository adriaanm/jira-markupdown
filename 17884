Subclassing `annotation.ClassfileAnnotation` ...
```scala
class Foo extends annotation.ClassfileAnnotation
```

... emits the following, misleading warning:
```scala
Implementation restriction: subclassing Classfile does not make your
annotation visible at runtime. If that is what you want,
you must write the annotation class in Java.
```

A) Um yes? ... That's exactly as intended. That's why the class is called `ClassfileAnnotation` and not `RuntimeAnnotation`.
B) The class is called `ClassfileAnnotation`, not `Classfile`.

If we had a non-functional `RuntimeAnnotation` somewhere in the library, the warning would make sense, but like this, it doesn't.
