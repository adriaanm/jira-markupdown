There is a similar problem with other by-name types.  For example this works:
```scala
scala> def f(i: => Int = 3) = i
f: (i: => Int)Int
```

but not this:
```scala
scala> class Foo(i: => Int = 3)
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(3)
 required: => Int
       class Foo(i: => Int = 3)
```

It seems like the compiler is failing to handle default values for method and constructor arguments in the same way.
