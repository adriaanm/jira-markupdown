I implemented a Scala scripting engine a while ago for the Apache Sling project (http://sling.apache.org/). The source is here: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/sling/trunk/contrib/scripting/scala/

- Runs inside an OSGi container. That is, the compile time classpath considers classes provided by the OSGi environment. 

- Each script is also a standalone Scala source entity. This leverages existing tools like IDEs and unit test suites. Of course it adds a little bit of extra burden on the script author. 

- Script bindings are visible on all its accessible interfaces. This is done by generating appropriate implicit conversions at compile time. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-1236 for details. 

Currently I'm working on untangling the scripting engine from Sling. My aim is to make it as versatile as possible. That is, it should run within/without OSGi and should be of course independent from Sling (or any other framework).
