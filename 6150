Noting for posterity that this has been fixed in the [downstream Ubuntu package for Xenial|http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/scala], which can be applied fairly easily to older releases e.g. Trusty.  So you can now even use a heredoc with scala REPL without too much annoyance.

I couldn't locate the bug-report, but this was broken in {{2.9.2+dfsg-2}} and working in {{scala_2.11.6-6_all}}.  In the broken version, blindly typing {{stty sane}} brings back a reasonable tty.
