There seem to be a some of inconsistencies in the way we deprecation annotations.

- Should the scala {{@deprecated}} add the Java annotation {{@Deprecated}}, or just the {{ACC_DEPRECATED}} flag?
- Adding Java's {{@Deprecated}} to a Scala class does not trigger any deprecation warnings (neither in scalac nor in javac)

etc.
As far as I see, {{@Deprecated}} being added to the {{RuntimeVisibleAttribute}} is just because it is defined with {{RetentionPolicy}} {{RUNTIME}}, but {{ACC_DEPRECATED}} is the only thing that counts semantically.

From the declaration of {{@deprecated}} it is just a "source annotation". I wouldn't bother introducing another special case, especially because the attribute really just records whether "annotation X was here" and doesn't carry any semantic meaning.

If we want {{@deprecated}} to show up, we should make it extend the appropriate Annotation type in Scala.

Whether we'd like to support {{@Deprecated}} is an interesting question.

By the way, maybe we can just type alias {{@Deprecated}} to {{@deprecated}} in Scala? That might be a much simpler approach.
