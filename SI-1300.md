Sorry for the interpreter log, but the following error only occurs in the interpreter. I can't reproduce it in the compiler or the script runner.

```scala
scala> val it = Array(0, 1,2)
it: Array[Int] = Array(0, 1, 2)

scala> it.toArray[Any]
java.lang.ClassCastException: [I
	at .<init>(<console>:6)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:3)
	at RequestResult$$.<clinit>(<console>)

	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)
	at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl...
```

I'm assuming the issue is something to do with the way the interpreter displays the result, but I can't think what. Note that the following works:


```scala
scala> val it = Array(0, 1, 2)
it: Array[Int] = Array(0, 1, 2)

scala> println(it.toArray[Any])
Array(0, 1, 2)
```
I can't really see any way that this is something specific to the interpreter.  I think it is probably just related to general Array craziness.  For example, I can produce the same exception with the following code 
```scala
object O extends Application {
  val arr = Array(0,1,2)
  val x = arr.toArray[Any]
  println(x(0))
}
```
Fair enough. But there seems to be different behaviour when doing the same thing as the interpreter code in compiled code. The following ostensibly equivalent code works fine:

```scala
object ArrayAny{
  def main(args : Array[String]){
    val it = Array(1, 2, 3);

    println(it.toArray[Any]);
  }
}
```

Which is why I reported this as an interpreter issue. Your version seems like a more likely root cause though, yes. 
Yes, I agree. toArray[Any] is clearly the root cause here. As per my other bug about Array[Int] and Array[Any] (#1301) the code for handling primitive arrays as Array[Any]s generally appears to flat out not work. 

But I'd expect it to be broken the same way in both compiled and interpreted code if that were the only problem. 
In fact, the toArray[Any] issue here we're seeing is just caused by #1301. Copying primitive arrays to Array[Any] doesn't work, and that's what you need to be able to do to get toArray to work.
