=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
def b = throw new Exception
def e2 = print(" in finally")
def m1{      try{b}catch{case e=>print(e);return}   finally e2}
def m2{ try{ try{b}catch{case e=>print(e);return} } finally e2}
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The specification states the following (in 6.22):
A try expression *try { b } catch e1 finally e2* is a shorthand for
*try { try { b } catch e1 } finally e2*.

Therefore I expect both methods m1 and m2 to give the same result.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Method m1 does not execute the finally block e2.
Method m2 does execute it.

{code}
scala> def b = throw new Exception
b: Nothing

scala> def e2 = print(" in finally")
e2: Unit

scala> def m1{      try{b}catch{case e=>print(e);return}   finally e2}
m1: Unit

scala> def m2{ try{ try{b}catch{case e=>print(e);return} } finally e2}
m2: Unit

scala> m1
java.lang.Exception
scala> m2
java.lang.Exception in finally
{code}

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.r0-b20101115201101
  - Java: 1.6.0_21
  - Operating system: Windows Vista

Well, I can confirm the bug is there.  Beyond that I don't know how quickly I'd be able to fix it.  See also SI-3965, and we should really fix these for 2.9.  People should be able to rely on finally blocks without holding their breath.  Raising to high.
(In r24377) Renamed some methods in icode exception handlers  for clarification, 
fixed finalizers for 'return' inside a catch block. closes SI-4240. review by rytz.
