The `toSingleLine` method in Position was deprecated in 1282395572b699ca85d4c1dbf3b16f7dad3e9732 and given `focus` as replacement. However, that is not at all the same thing:

* the original method returned another range position, cut to the end of the first line
* focus returns an offset position (length is 0)

I suggest the method is undeprecated.
