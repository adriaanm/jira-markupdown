Today, I spend much time to find out why my reflection code does not work in REPL. And finally, I am sure that I had been cheated by REPL: 
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.7.0_09).

Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> """$line3.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$Hello, World"""
res0: String = Hello, World
{code}

I consider replacing {{$line3.$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$}} trick as a bug, because it breaks reflect like {{class Foo; Class.forName("Foo")}} and make people confused.

I highly recommend to remove this trick.
I never remember if it's wrapStrings or unwrapStrings and whether it should be true or false.
{code}
scala> $intp.isettings
res0: scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.ISettings =

 ISettings {
   deprecation = false
  maxAutoprintCompletion = 250
  maxPrintString = 800
  unwrapStrings = true

 }

scala> $intp.isettings.unwrapStrings = false
$intp.isettings.unwrapStrings: Boolean = false
{code}
The recent simplification of the javap command leaves it un-unwrapped. That is, true names are shown.
