Is this issue the same as SI-3072 ? Seems there that lazy val foo: Nothing = throw.... does not cause a dead code warning, but lazy val foo: Unit = throw.... does cause the warning.

I think my situation is same as the latter. In my example, lazy val foo is an override of def foo: FooType in a base class.
