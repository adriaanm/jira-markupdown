OK no problem :-)

Using similar code I am able to reproduce the bug that we've talked about in the mailing list (see the link in the bug report) but not every time I do a clean. I will probably look at it again tomorrow but I believe that solving this bug might also solve the mailing list bug.

I am using the SDT 2.8 for some small personal projects and I have to say that I am very pleased with the progress you've made so far and I am confident that 2.8 will have a very good Eclipse plugin. So far my biggest pains are the various compiler problems (many of which are build manager related, see: SI-2581) and the lack of good code completion. When you finish with some annoying bugs it would be really helpful to start working on code completion again (I've noticed some improvements lately).
