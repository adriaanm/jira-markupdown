For some reason, immutable.Vector is declared final. 

- This is out of step with all other concrete collection classes that I checked. 
- There does not seem to be any functional reason why the class needs to be final. 
- If final was added to enable better performance, its a blunt instrument. It seems preferable to declare those methods final which need to be for performance reasons, if its known to help.

And, of course, it prevents extension of the class by others. Its always tempting to think "There's no valid reason why anyone would need to extend this class", but that statement is much less likely to prove true than "There's no valid reason why anyone should think they can perfectly predict the future".

I'm raising this issue because I do have a IMO valid reason to extend Vector. I want to add a phantom type ('P') to a Vector:

class PhantomOfTheVector[A+, P] extends Vector[A]

...without incurring the overhead of wrapping it.
Perhaps you can use this instead:

{code}
type PhantomOfTheVector[A+, P] = Vector[A]
{code}
That's a neat technique that I must remember - thanks. But alas, after some experimentation I don't think it can resolve my problem. You've made me aware that I really want to do mixin composition of Vector, more like:

class PhantomOfTheVector[A+, P] extends Vector[A] with Phantom[A, P]

I.e. make a Vector that also implements another interface, without wrapping it.
