I'm left confused here.  I want to suppress deprecation warnings over a limited scope, for exactly the reasons identified above.  This bug's title asks to suppress unchecked warnings globally, which I don't want to vote for, but the conversation has clearly moved to suppress deprecation warnings over a limited scope, which I do want to vote for.

For clarity, I've opened a new bug for that focused need: SI-7934.

I'd suggest closing this bug as "Won't fix."  That's a fine response to the request "suppress unchecked warnings globally."  As for everyone who voted for this bug because they wanted "suppress deprecation warnings over a limited scope," I encourage you to head over to the new bug and vote for it.
