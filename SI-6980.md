{code}scala> :javap Predef#genericArrayOps{code}

should mean

{code}:javap scala.Predef$#genericArrayOps{code}

by respecting imports in scope and ignoring forwarders.
While you're mapping user strings to symbols, don't forget to improve:

```scala
$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_06).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def m = 8
m: Int

scala> class m
defined class m
warning: previously defined method m is not a companion to class m.
Companions must be defined together; you may wish to use :paste mode for this.
```

Edit: it improved.
