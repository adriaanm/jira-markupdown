Even further clarification: what you probably wanted to write was 
```scala
val c0a: Array[Class[T] forSome { type T }] = Array(classOf[String])
```
instead of 
```scala
val c0a: Array[Class[_]] = Array(classOf[String])
```
This places the existential quantifier in the correct location so that 
```scala
c0a(0) = classOf[String]
```
is well-typed.
