Even further clarification: what you probably wanted to write was 
{code}
val c0a: Array[Class[T] forSome { type T }] = Array(classOf[String])
{code}
instead of 
{code}
val c0a: Array[Class[_]] = Array(classOf[String])
{code}
This places the existential quantifier in the correct location so that 
{code}
c0a(0) = classOf[String]
{code}
is well-typed.
{code}
