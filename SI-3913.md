in the following scenario, a java.lang.VerifyError is thrown at runtime as soon as you try to reference LimboStage:

```scala
abstract sealed class Stage( val transits: Set[ Stage ])
case object IdleStage   extends Stage( Set.empty )
case object LimboStage  extends Stage( Set( IdleStage, LimboStage ))
```

```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: (class: LimboStage$$, method: <init> signature: ()V) Expecting to find object/array on stack
	at Test$$.main(Test.scala:7)
	at Test.main(Test.scala)
```
there is even more craziness. Test2 produces the following output:
```scala
idle transits = Set(BusyStage)
busy transits = Set(null)
```
so there is uninitialized stuff!
A workaround is in Test3 -- suggesting that the problem has to do with the way the object's constructor is called.
Hey, I already fixed this once, waaaay back in #473.  Not well enough I guess.  Let's see if I've learned anything in the 20 months since r17118.
(In r23222) Better check for objects trying to sneak themselves into the
superconstructor arguments.  Closes #3913, no review.
I'm ignoring the examples involving cycles as covered elsewhere (e.g. #3342.)
