I was wondering if there is a reason why the following is not allowed:

{code}
   implicit def foo(value : Int) = println(value)

   for (implicit elem : Array(1,2,3)) foo
{code}

of course the 'implicit' is even more to write than the '(elem)' at the end if 'foo' is only called once inside the loop. On the other hand the same is true with the keyword in front of a method parameter, which works well.
