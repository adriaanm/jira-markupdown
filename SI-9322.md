Running `scalac -verbose` shows very negative times for compiler phases, and some other things with elapsed times.

E.g.:
```
...
[loaded package loader stream in -1432078359796ms]
[loaded class file C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45\jre\lib\rt.jar(java/lang/CharSequence.class) in -1432078359792ms]
[typer in -1432078359153ms]
[patmat in -1432078359785ms]
[superaccessors in -1432078359790ms]
[extmethods in -1432078359800ms]
...
```

It looks like this change was introduced with work for #7546.
