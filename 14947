This is an old bug that I mistakenly thought it had gone away when bug SI-2581 got fixed. The problem here is that when we delete a file the classes that use the classes defined in the file do not get recompiled. If instead of deleting the file we comment out the code and save it everything works as expected (bug SI-2581).

*How to reproduce*
 1. Create a class A in a file A.scala
 2. Create a class B, in a file B.scala, that uses class A
 3. Delete the file A.scala

After step 3 file B does not get recompiled and as a result no error appears.

Tested using r20638.
