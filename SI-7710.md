From 1.7.0_06 onwards, String.substring() (and .subSequence) was changed to no longer re-use the internal char[] data, but make a copy instead. Since RegexParsers.scala:109 calls subSequence() for every character parsed, it now effectively re-allocates the whole remaining parse content for every parse step.

This shows in horrible parse performance and GC for parsing a 3MB file using https://github.com/ngocdaothanh/scaposer , which would parse almost instantly in Java 6.

Details on the changes to java.lang.String are mentioned here:

I guess one way around it would be wrapping CharSequence in a simple buffer, that does re-use the underlying CharSequence, adding in skip/count fields that maintain the current position.
I took Jan's suggestion and put together a {{FastCharSequence}} and it reclaimed the performance for java >= 7u6 when wrapping a String. I don't know if this belongs in the standard library, but I'm posting it here in case others find it useful.

{code:scala title=FastCharSequence.scala}
import java.lang.CharSequence

class FastCharSequence(chars: Array[Char], val startBounds: Int, val endBounds: Int) extends CharSequence {
  def this(chars: Array[Char]) = this(chars, 0, chars.length)
  def this(input: String)      = this(input.toCharArray)

  def length(): Int = endBounds - startBounds

  def charAt(index: Int): Char = {
    if (index < length) {
      chars(index + startBounds)
    } else {
      throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(s"$boundsInfo index: $index")
    }
  }

  def subSequence(start: Int, end: Int): CharSequence = {
    if (start >= 0 && start <= length && end >= 0 && end <= length) {
      new FastCharSequence(chars, startBounds + start, startBounds + end)
    } else {
     throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(s"$boundsInfo start: $start, end $end")
    }
  }

  override def toString(): String = new String(chars, startBounds, length)

  private def boundsInfo = s"current: (startBounds: $startBounds, endBounds: $endBounds, length: $length, chars length: ${chars.length})"
}
{code}
@rex Oh, I didn't make any changes to the parser code at all. I'm using the stock code from 2.10.3.

All I'm doing is wrapping a String in this class and parsing that instead of parsing the String directly. This conforms to the CharSequence interface (which the scala parsing code depends on). In java < 7u6, the underlying character array was reused within String.java. Now String.java copies the underlying array each time for safety.

So this class just reuses that array at level higher and any others created from {{subSequence}}.

I considered memoizing {{toString}} since {{new String(chars, startBounds, length)}}, will iterate over the array each time, but perf seemed good enough without it.
Did this make it any further? Will it be in a release soon?
