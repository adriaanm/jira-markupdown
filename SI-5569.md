Currently, the page http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html reports that it is for Version 2.8. However, it lists the method minBy, which wasn't added until Version 2.9 (at least according to http://www.scala-lang.org/node/43 )

It seems that either the reported version number is wrong, or the documentation contains methods it shouldn't.
The documentation is targeting the 2.9.1-1 release as shown in the window title.

The version mentioned in the documentiton is not necessarily connected to the Scala Version. "2.8" is mentioned there probably because the class was largely rewritten between 2.7 and 2.8.
