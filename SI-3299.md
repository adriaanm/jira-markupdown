This worked with the beta1, and fails with 2.8.0.RC1.

{code}
object Failure {
  def thunk() {
    for (i <- 1 to 2) {
      val Array(a, b) = Array(1,2)
      ()
    }
  }
}
{code}

throws a requirement failed exception (attached).
here's a one-liner that triggers a similar error:
{code}
class C { def f(g: => Unit) { } ; f { val R = "".r; val R() = "" } }
{code}
no Array, so the problem seems to be with extractors in general.

with both d3zd3z's test code and my test code, compiling with -no-specialization makes the error go away
