The `mutable.BufferLike` has this nice remove method which returns the removed item as well as mutating the mutable collection:

   def remove(index: Int): A


But, it also has this remove method which takes in a count but does NOT return back the removed items:

   def remove(index: Int, count: Int): Unit


The above method should not return an Unit but the list of removed items.

See: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/5562e1a2eb07b9a541b3eac85a809847e2d48763/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/BufferLike.scala#L106-L121

All we need to do is to change the lines `for (i <- 0 until count) remove(n)` to `(0 until count).map(i => remove(n))`

This change should be backwards compatible since it was earlier returning an `Unit` anyway.
Note that the workaround is to call `slice` first, before `remove`.

I guess if we made this change, the result type ought to match {{slice}}'s result type, so your proposed code change would need some refinement.

It's not a no-brainer that this change is desirable; single-element `remove` never needs to allocate, but multi-element `remove` would have to allocate. If the return value is usually ignored, then allocating is undesirable.
