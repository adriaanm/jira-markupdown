=== What steps will reproduce the problem ? ===
{code}
scalac A.scala
{code}

A.scala:
{code}
class A { val a = <a>&SI-203c;</a> }
{code} 


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The program has a syntax error. The compiler should report the error instead of crashing.

=== What do you see instead? ===

The compiler crashes with an OutOfMemoryError exception.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

Environment: 2.8.1, 1.6.0_21, Windows Vista.

The implementation of `MarkupParsers.xCharRef` was delegated to `Utility.parseCharRef` in commit `a14eb241e1663883532dadb23ae568117bf5ed66`.  The case handling `SU` got dropped:
{code}
-          case SU =>
-            throw TruncatedXML
{code}
so `parseCharRef` loops on SU, continually adding error messages to a buffer until the OOME.

With this case restored, there are 6 error messages, but since this was the behavior in 2.7.7, I guess it is expected:
{code}
