=== What steps will reproduce the problem ? ===
```scala
scalac A.scala
```

A.scala:
```scala
class A { val a = <a>&SI-203c;</a> }
```


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The program has a syntax error. The compiler should report the error instead of crashing.

=== What do you see instead? ===

The compiler crashes with an OutOfMemoryError exception.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

Environment: 2.8.1, 1.6.0_21, Windows Vista.
The implementation of `MarkupParsers.xCharRef` was delegated to `Utility.parseCharRef` in commit `a14eb241e1663883532dadb23ae568117bf5ed66`.  The case handling `SU` got dropped:
```scala
-          case SU =>
-            throw TruncatedXML
```
so `parseCharRef` loops on SU, continually adding error messages to a buffer until the OOME.

With this case restored, there are 6 error messages, but since this was the behavior in 2.7.7, I guess it is expected:
```scala
A.scala:1: error: in XML literal: hex char not allowed in decimal char ref
Did you mean to write &#x ?
class A { val a = <a>&SI-203c;</a> }
                         ^

class A { val a = <a>&SI-203c;</a> }

                                 ^
