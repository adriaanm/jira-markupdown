Example in scala console:

scala> val (c: Int, d: Int) = (1,c+1)
c: Int = 1
d: Int = 1

c appears to be defaulted to a value of 0
It warns in 2.11. Git blames Miguel, who incriminated himself by leaving behind a comment in the code.
```scala
Inspect for obvious out-of-order initialization...
```

```scala
scala>  val (c: Int, d) = (1,c+1)
<console>:9: warning: Reference to uninitialized value c
        val (c: Int, d) = (1,c+1)
                             ^
c: Int = 1
d: Int = 1
```
as A.P. points out, this now warns, so that's as fixed as this can currently get within the current initialization design.

you might expect this to warn too but it doesn't:

```scala
val c: Int = c + 1
```

but that would be a matter for another ticket.
