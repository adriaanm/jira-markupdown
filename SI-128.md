The following once worked (at some point before 2.6.0-final)

{code}
trait AnswerType {
  type Answer
  def answer(n: Int): Answer
}

def confirm(answerType: AnswerType) = answerType.answer(0)
{code}

Now, the compiler says confirm has an "illegal dependent method type". If it's not allowed, why?


you have to enable experimental features for dependent method types (they're not fully implemented yet):
{code}
