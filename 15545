In 2.8.0.final and r22621:

{code}
scala> def act: Int => Int = { case _ =>
     |   lazy val (a, b) = (3,9)
     |   a
     |   b
     | }
act: (Int) => Int

scala> act(1)
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at $$anonfun$$act$$1.b$$1(<console>:6)
        at $$anonfun$$act$$1.apply$$mcII$$sp(<console>:8)
...
{code}

The NPE is on the reference to b.  The NPE does not occur if only one of a or b is referenced.  If the order that a and b are referenced is switched, the NPE still occurs on the second reference.

The type of the elements of the tuple does not matter. Booleans, Strings, ... all cause a NPE.  If `lazy` is removed, the NPE does not occur.
