There's no reason CovTrait should be afforded any privilege above CovAlias.
```scala
object Bug {
  import scala.annotation.unchecked.{ uncheckedVariance => uV }

  trait Base[T] { def f: java.util.Iterator[T] }
  trait CovTrait[+T] extends java.util.Iterator[T @uV]
  type CovAlias[+T] = java.util.Iterator[T @uV]

  // compiles
  class A[+T] extends Base[T @uV] { def f: CovTrait[T] = null }
  // fails
  class B[+T] extends Base[T @uV] { def f: CovAlias[T] = null }
  // <console>:17: error: covariant type T occurs in invariant position in type => Bug.CovAlias[T] of method f
  //          class B[+T] extends Base[T @uV] { def f: CovAlias[T] = null }
  //                                                ^
}
```
That's not always an option:
```scala
illegal inheritance from final class Optional
[error] trait Optional[+T] extends java.util.Optional[T @uV]
[error]                                      ^
[error] one error found
```
Without fixing this there is no way to treat java.util.Optional (for instance - as one example among endless) as the covariant type it should be without adding an uncheckedVariance annotation at every single use site until you die. Of course there's no point in that, you can write _ <: A at every single use site until you die, and that's probably shorter.
```scala
scala> import scala.annotation.unchecked.{ uncheckedVariance => uV }
import scala.annotation.unchecked.{uncheckedVariance=>uV}

scala> type Opt[+A] = java.util.Optional[A @uV]
defined type alias Opt

scala> class A[+T](val x: Opt[T])
<console>:9: error: covariant type T occurs in invariant position in type => Opt[T] of value x
       class A[+T](val x: Opt[T])
                       ^

scala> class A[+T](val x: java.util.Optional[T])
<console>:8: error: covariant type T occurs in invariant position in type => java.util.Optional[T] of value x
       class A[+T](val x: java.util.Optional[T])
                       ^

scala> class A[+T](val x: Option[T])
defined class A

scala> class A[+T](val x: java.util.Optional[_ <: T])
defined class A

scala> class A[+T](val x: Opt[T @uV])
defined class A
```
Relatedly, I've found that the way that AsSeenFrom discards (most) annotations is the root cause of #8071. I asked for the history of this, and Martin said that originally no annotations where preserved through typemaps. When CPS needed it, rather than passing them all through, only the CPS related annotation was passed through. Why not pass them all? He wasn't sure, but a plausible theory was it was an attempt at a minimal change to solve the problem at hand.

I'm going to try to pass through all annotations to see if anything breaks or gets slower. Hopefully that change will also sort out this ticket.
I spotted #8071 last night on my scan of recent tickets. Funny timing.

Annotations have all kinds of different and not easily categorized influence. Discarding them selectively without anyone even knowing the reasoning why... I guess that's where I check out of this comment.
Aside from the question of honouring uncheckedVariance in alias RHS, which can be done by preserving annotations through type maps as Paul's experiment has confirmed, we should also pause to ask the broader question: after the fix for #6566, which restores variance checking of the RHS of type aliases, is checking expansions redundant or somehow still material to prevent unsoundness.

If we omit the checks on the RHS because the alias is sufficiently private, we clearly **must** check expansions. For example, the following is unsound but was allowed in Scala 2.7:

```scala
trait C[-I] {
  private[this] type X = C[I]
  def f2(b: X): Unit
}
```

Intuitively, I think we only need to check in one place. But I'll give it some more thought.
See also my last comment on #8071, written two years ago tomorrow. "But #8079 doesn't. Just a reminder that it is easy to fix. Java 8 is out and has a lot going for it. One thing scala can do to assist in its survival is offer nicer wrappers around java 8. It has to be possible to write them though."
