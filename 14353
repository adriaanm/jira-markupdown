Priority: very low. 
I guess no one ever will sensibly do this, but it's somewhat unexpected.
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.5.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_13)
.
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def res1 = 0
res1: Int

scala> 1
res0: Int = 1

scala> 2
res1: Int = 2

scala> res1
res2: Int = 2
```

while my defined value gets lost, I guess.
