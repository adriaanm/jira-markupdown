Java code:
{code}
public class R {
    public static final byte z = 123;
}
{code}
Scala code:
{code}
object A {
  val x: Char = R.z
}
{code}

Scala code shouldn't compile. Moreover in case of static method in Java code won't compile.
The R.z is constant-folded (inlined by the type checker), and then the following implicit conversion is implied (from the spec):

{quote}
Numeric Literal Narrowing. If the expected type is Byte, Short or Char, and the expression e is an integer literal fitting in the range of that type, it is converted to the same literal in that type.
{quote}
So 5/6 of these can successfully be assigned to a byte:
{code}
    public static final byte z1  = 123;
    public static final short z2 = 123;
    public static final char z3  = 123;
    public static final int z4   = 123;
    public static final long z5  = 123;
    public static final byte z6  = -123;
{code}
Why stop at 5? Squeeze the long in too, that 123 is just as 123 as the other 123s.

It's funny to think that one could change a static final java *int* from 127 to 128, and this would break the scala code which makes use of it, and it would all be by design. I hope things keep getting weirder.
