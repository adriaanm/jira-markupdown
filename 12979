The two !RichString.split methods don't escape properly.  split(char) misses ?*>+(] and split(string) can break on ][!^-\

One solution would be to augment the private !RichString.escape method to handle those chars as well.  But it might be easier to just use the \Q \E escapes so that Pattern will do the escaping for you:

{code}
  def split(separator: Char): Array[String] = self.split("\\Q"+separator+"\\E")

  def split(separators: Array[Char]): Array[String] = {
    val re = separators.foldLeft("[\\Q")(_+_) + "\\E]"
    self.split(re)
  }
{code}

I've enclosed a file that demonstrates the bugs and also successfully runs those cases through the above implementations.
