This compiles:

```scala
class Test {
  private
  def foo = 10
}
```

while this does not

```scala
class Test {
  private[this]
  def foo = 10
}
```

```scala
error: expected start of definition
  private[this]
               ^
one error found
```

For longer definitions and keeping my lines within 80 characters, moving
the private to another line is nice, also when you have the final modifier
making lines even longer.
