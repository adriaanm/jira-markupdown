But the following works, even though `s` is immutable:

{code}
scala> val s = collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3)
s: scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int] = Set(3, 1, 2)

scala> s += 2
{code}

..and would fail on an `immutable.Set`. And that really is because method `+=` is not found, not because `s` is a `val`.

What could be a better message that handles both cases?
