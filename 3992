The copyright notice was *not* added by accident.

The patch was built in 20% time while I was already working for Google, using Google's resources. The patch was formally reviewed and approved and Google is ok with it being part of Scala and people using, distributing, etc... it under the Scala license. 

That is why the copyright notice is there. See "committed to open source" in http://investor.google.com/corporate/code-of-conduct.html 

Hope this helps!
