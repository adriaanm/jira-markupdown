According to spec this is not accetable(ScalaExpr ::= ‘{’ Expr ‘}’):
```scala
object BrokenXml extends Application {
  val xml = <xml>{
    val nodes = new ListBuffer[Node]
    nodes + <element/>
    nodes
  }</xml>
  println(xml)
}
```

But it's good for compiler.
The same thing with ScalaPattern in xml injections.
You can use: 
```scala
  <xml>{pattern@_*}</xml>
```
But in spec written that ScalaPatterns ::= ‘{’ Patterns ‘}’
Patterns is Pattern sequence. And situatation that pattern@_* could be not described.
Only StableId(pattern@_*) allowed by specification.
It's very important to know precise parser behaviour.
