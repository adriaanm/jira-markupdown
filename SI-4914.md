If I understand ยง3.2.10 of the language reference correctly then 
```
Map[x.type#S, x.type#S] forSome { val x: T }
```
should be equivalent to
```
Map[t#S, t#S] forSome { type t <: T with Singleton }
```
but they do seem to behave different in practice. When compiling
```
trait Type {
  type S
}

class ConcreteType extends Type {
  type S = Double
}

trait Base {
  type T <: Type
  val m: Map[t#S, t#S] forSome { type t <: T with Singleton }
  val n: Map[x.type#S, x.type#S] forSome { val x: T }
}

abstract class Derived extends Base {
  override type T = ConcreteType
  override val m = Map[Double, Double]()
  /** This does not work. ยง3.2.10 indicates that types n is shorthand for type of m. */
  override val n = Map[Double, Double]()
}
```
There is an error for overriding `n`, but no error for overriding `m`. Am I misunderstanding the language reference?
This compiles, which I imagine is sufficient evidence that you're looking at a bug.
```scala

trait Type {
  type S
}

trait Base {
  type T <: Type
  type M = Map[t#S, t#S] forSome { type t <: T with Singleton }
  type N = Map[x.type#S, x.type#S] forSome { val x: T }
}

abstract class Derived extends Base {
  type T = Type { type S = Double }
  override type M = Map[Double, Double]
  override type N = Map[Double, Double]
}

abstract class Derived2 extends Derived {
  val m: M = Map()
  val n: N = Map()
}
```
This is a duplicate of #482, but I'm closing that one in favor of this one.
