The decision was made some time back (1245, 668, 602) to support things like null.asInstanceOf[Int]. This prints 1 instead of failing:

{code}
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val i: Int = null.asInstanceOf[Int]
    println(1 + i)
  }
}
{code}

Please update the spec section 6.3 which currently reads

{quote}
asInstanceOf[T ] returns the "null" object itself if T conforms to
scala.AnyRef, and throws a NullPointerException otherwise.
