Issue: have 3 or more dependent classes spread across projects: Project1 ( Class1 <- Class2) <- Project2 (Class3).

If Class1 is broken, then Class2 is correctly not compiled. However, Project 2 is compiled and Class3 fails with "not found: type Class2".

In multiple projects, this cascades and causes an unholly mess of hundreds of errors, every time a "base" class is saved with an error - actually hiding the original error.

Solution seems simple enough: if pre-requisite projects have compilation errors, do not compile dependent projects - especially during incremental builds. Maybe should still try them when clean/build...

here's the test you asked: behavior as expected...

~/workspace7u6/tt/ScalaFail1/src\> 
~/workspace7u6/tt/ScalaFail1/src\> scalac -d ../bin fail1/*
fail1/SC11.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: String
   def m1 : String = 1
                     ^
one error found
~/workspace7u6/tt/ScalaFail1/src\> cd ../../ScalaFail2/src
~/workspace7u6/tt/ScalaFail2/src\> scalac -d ../bin fail2/*
~/workspace7u6/tt/ScalaFail2/src\> > scalac -d ../bin -classpath ../../ScalaFail1/bifail2/*
fail2/SC22.scala:4: error: not found: type SC11
   def m1 : String = new SC11().m1
                         ^
fail2/SC23.scala:6: error: not found: type SC12
   def m1 : String = new SC12().m1
                         ^
two errors found

to answer ijuma - the default also makes sense to get a glimpse of all the problems. there may actualyl be errors in a bunch of places, trigerred by an interface change.

to answer Miles - no. I just found a work-around to filter the errors to the current project. I still think the original problem should be fixed: don't rebuild dependent classes in dependent projects when the prerequisites failed. They will surely fail and just pollute the errors list.

It is also an inconsisiteny in the example I gave: class 2 is not recompiled, because it's in the same directory and the compiler knows it will fail. class3 however is in a different project and I think the plugin just invokes the compiler like the manual test I did above. I don't think it should. You can compare this behavior with the default Java builder behavior.
