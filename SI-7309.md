In the following code, the reaction doesn't work (workaround is to use the commented-out traditional Java Swing).

It would appear that FocusGained is not being passed to the partial matchers in reactions.

This is similar to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7307 and I'm getting a sense that many Reactors are not being fired in scala.swing.

{code}
  val panel1 = new BorderPanel() {
    reactions += {
      case e: FocusGained => nameField.requestFocus()
    }
    layout(new MarkdownPanel("summary")) = Center
    layout(new FlowPanel {
      contents += new Label(prompt)
      contents += nameField
      contents += Swing.VStrut(400)
    }) = South
  }.peer
//  panel1.addFocusListener(new FocusAdapter {
//    override def focusGained(e: FocusEvent) {nameField.requestFocus()}
//  })
{code}
