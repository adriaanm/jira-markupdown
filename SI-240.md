For now, we only have call-by-name parameters. We should allow the `lazy` modifier on parameters, for instance:

```scala
def f[a](lazy t: a) = {
 ..
}
```

The meaning should be equivalent to:

```scala
def f[a](t': => a) = {
  lazy val t: a = t'
  ..
}
```
see also #720
For completeness, see also duplicate #5244.
Does anything block somebody productively championing this (writing a SIP, updating the patch, delivering an impassioned plea to Martin, waiting for Martin to finish *x* other things so that he has time to consider this class of thing)?

Additional desired syntax, if this is supported in (primary) constructors:

```scala
class Stuff([[mods]] lazy val a: Int, [[mods]] def b: Int)
```

translating to (modulo named-argument issues):

```scala
class Stuff(a': => Int, b': => Int) {
  [[mods]] lazy val a: Int = a'
  [[mods]] def b: Int = b'
}
```
Shaking out the corner cases would be the first step.

To get the ball rolling: what would be expected here?

```scala
def foo(lazy a: Int)(b: Int = a) { a }
foo({println("!"); 0})()
```
Leaving aside for a moment that default values don't make sense in anonymous functions, I'd expect these two to be (operationally) semantically equivalent modulo currying:

```scala
def foo(lazy a: Int)(b: Int = a) { println("<") ; a; println(">") }
def bar(lazy a: Int): (Int) => Unit = (b: Int = a) => {println("<") ; a; println(">"); ()}
```

With the 'evaluate on first de-reference' semantics of lazy, I'd expect this to run as follows:

```scala
foo({println("!"; 42})()
| !<>
foo({println("!"; 42})(13)
| <!>
```

However, I'd see an argument for excluding lazy arguments from default values lists, as this least-surprise semantics will require some fancy re-writes that I can't imagine how to get right in the presence of currying.
Why is that hard to get right? Just as

```scala
def foo(a: Int)(b: Int = a) { ... }

foo(effectfulCode)()
```

rewrites to (I forget the exact mangling, but roughly)

```scala
def foo(a: Int)(b: Int) { ... }
def foo$default2(a: Int): Int = a

val x$1: Int = effectfulCode
foo(x$1)(foo$default2(x$1))
```

, I would expect

```scala
def foo(lazy a: Int)(b: Int = a) { ... }

foo(effectfulCode)()
```

to rewrite to

```scala
def foo(a: => Int)(b: Int) { ... }
def foo$default2(a: => Int): Int = a

lazy val x$1: Int = effectfulCode
foo(x$1)(foo$default2(x$1))
```

Wouldn't that have the desired semantics?
Ahhh, I see. Mmm. I don't know; it's not as if it's incorrect to have the rewriting at the call site when necessary and also in the method in all cases, just a bit wasteful.

Also, consider eta-expansion:

```scala
def foo(lazy a: Int) = { a; a }
val f = foo _
```

f should have type (=> Int) => Int (I think; unless we're reforming how call-by-name types work), but the lazy semantics should be preserved so that a is evaluated only once. Either the rewrite is internal, or the eta-expansion gets complicated.

Similarly, can we allow anonymous functions to have lazy arguments, given that we already permit them to have call-by-name?

```scala
val f: (=> Int) => Int = (lazy a) => { a; a }
```
