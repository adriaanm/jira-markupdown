=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Go to to http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/annotation/target/field.html and http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/annotation/target/param.html

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Full explanation of the purpose and behavior of these annotations.

=== What do you see instead? ===

These pages look like copy/paste of the same doc.
They mention an Id annotation which I can't find in http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Annotation.html page, and the given examples mention but don't use @field, and @param isn't even mentioned.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

Just the current (as of ticket creation time) public ScalaDoc.
(In r24464) improved documentation for annotations in scala.annotation.target. closes SI-4250, no review.
