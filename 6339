fixed in [https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/57967c9d1e93aa3a4d26fc02f13172f4622ed9e3]

The crash is in CleanUp: It generates a static field & constructor in the interface class (that's wrong) because the "scala.Symbol.apply(...)" code remains in the interface as a default argument. Fixed by removing all default arguments from parameter ValDefs in UnCurry.
