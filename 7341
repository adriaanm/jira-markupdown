There's an example in nightly.

See [scala.collection.parallel.package|http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.collection.parallel.package]. Note the method {{setTaskSupport}}.

Then, navigate to the "S" index page: http://www.scala-http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#index.index-s

There's no {{setTaskSupport}} method listed.
