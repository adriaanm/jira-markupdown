I agree it's a nice to have functionality which needs to be balanced against the increased complexity and language footprint if we were to implement something like that. Right now I do not see it's worth it. What in onCreate is Scala specific? If it makes sense to add it to Scala why has it not been added to Java? Generally, we strive to be leaner and more regular than Java in these things. 

So why is DelayedInit different? Two reasons: First, DelayedInit does have to do with Scala's functional nature. You cannot simulate DelayedInit yourself without changing all affected val fields to vars. Second, DelayedInit fixes a very common pattern with the Application trait.
