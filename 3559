Upon further exploration, I realize that it was naive of me to expect anything like compatibility in a dot-release upgrade to Scala.  I'm not sure what that means for this bug, it IS still a bug, but there are much more annoying incompatibilities to deal with, and I rather doubt that you have the resources to create a transitional release.
