Many [Use case] entries in the documentation of ArrayOps and StringOps report ArrayOps and StringOps as return type when it should be Array and String (or Seq[...]). It seems to be due simply to a wrong @define Coll in both classes. 
It seems there were more problems with this. See [fcbdc172](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/fcbdc1725c6fcd65a071709408ef75097f487cb7) for details.
