{code}
scala> trait Foo[X] { def foo : Map[String,Foo[X]] }
defined trait Foo

scala> def f[T]() : Foo[T] = new Foo[T] { var foo = Map[String,Foo[T]]() }
f: [T]()Foo[T]
{code}

And now leads to:
{code}
<console>:6: error: object creation impossible, since method foo in trait Foo of type => Map[String,Foo[T]] is not defined
       def f[T]() : Foo[T] = new Foo[T] { var foo = Map[String,Foo[T]]() }
{code}

Fixed formatting and trimmed summary.  Easy to spot since there weren't many suspects: introduced in r22184, right here:
{code}
-              member.setFlag(PRIVATE)
-              member.privateWithin = NoSymbol
+              member.privateWithin = classDef.symbol
{code}
(In r22253) Closes SI-3174 and SI-3560. Review by moors.

(In r22254) Applied patch that closes SI-3560 and still fixes SI-3174.
