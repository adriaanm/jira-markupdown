When doing ant -f sabbus dist on windows, I get:

```scala
locker.build:
    [mkdir] Created dir: C:\scala\build\locker\classes\library
    [javac] Compiling 12 source files to C:\scala\build\locker\classes\library
   [sabuse] Compiling 1 file to C:\scala\build\locker\classes\library
   [sabuse] Compiling 330 files to C:\scala\build\locker\classes\library
[propertyfile] Creating new property file: C:\scala\build\locker\classes\library\library.properties
  [symlink] ln -s C:\scala/lib/fjbg.jar C:\scala/build/locker/classes/fjbg.jar
    [mkdir] Created dir: C:\scala\build\locker\classes\compiler

BUILD FAILED
C:\scala\sabbus.xml:32: The following error occurred while executing this line:
C:\scala\sabbus.xml:186: java.lang.Exception: don't know what to do with Files\apache-ant-1.7.0\lib\ant.jar
```

The problem is that ant.home is "Program Files\lib\... " and the "Program " part gets lost.
There is still a similar problem with Partest (see #622).
