In

```scala
trait A {
  val x: Int
}

trait B extends A {
  val x = "Hello"
}
```

the error message is

```
overriding value x in trait A of type Int;
 value x has incompatible type      ^
```

By analogy with the error message when a def is involved rather than a val, a clearer error message would be:

```
type mismatch;
 found   : String("Hello")
 required: Int
```
