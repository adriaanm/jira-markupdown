A Scala IDE user reported a compiler blowup, which makes the IDE unusable: https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1002389?comment=695983983#/activity/ticket:

I managed to minimize the problem far enough to reproduce it on the commandline, see instructions here: https://github.com/sschaef/scoobi-blowup

Looking at the output of svelto (https://github.com/dragos/svelto), it seems that the compiler is doing too much work in the typechecker.
