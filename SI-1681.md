When I try to compile the following code with Scala 2.8.0.r16921-b20090115021734

{code}
def x = synchronized { throw new Exception }
{code}

I get a dead code warning

{code}
(fragment of unreachable.scala):1: warning: dead code following this construct
def x = synchronized { throw new Exception }
                        ^
{code}

No code follows the {{throw}}, so I think the warning is spurious. Perhaps {{synchronized}} generates some code which triggers the warning?
Nevermind, I see you are using the undocumented -Ywarn-dead-code option.  You shouldn't really expect any reliability from -Y options.  However, this particular instance appears to have something to do with the fact that 
{code}
def x = synchronized { throw new Exception }
{code}
is translated into 
{code}
def x = this.synchronized[Nothing](throw new Exception)
{code}
Further testing reveals it doesn't really have anything to do with synchronized.  The following reports no error:
{code}
class Foo {
  def y(arg:Any) = println("foo")
  def z = this.y(throw new Exception)
}
{code}
while the following does:
{code}
class Foo {
  def y[T](arg:T) = println("foo")
  def z = this.y(throw new Exception)
}
{code}



Hi, recently run into false "dead code" warnings using the Scale IDE for Eclipse -- seemingly the problem is still there. What I don't understand is: in my example no type parameter is involved (but maybe there is some hidden type parameter?)

{code}
package dummy

object Error {
    def soSorry(msg: String = "sorry"): Nothing =
        throw new Exception("we have a problem: "+msg)
}

class Dummy {

    def dummy1: Int = synchronized {
        val i = 10 + 2
        return i
    }
    
    def dummy2: String = Error.soSorry("we're dummies")
}
{code}
compiling with 2.8.0 {{scalac -Ywarn-dead-code dummy/Dummy.scala }} produces two dead code warnings
(In r23768) Fixed various issues with -Ywarn-dead-code.  Try it again and
enjoy fewer spurious warnings.  Closes SI-1681, no review.
