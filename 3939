Is this issue resolved? It seems that work has been done to put in a switch that provides the behavior needed. If so then this issue seems done. If not should this be re-created on the scala-xml github issues list?

(Note: I created https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/74, but will close it out if we determine this issue is actually complete already.)
