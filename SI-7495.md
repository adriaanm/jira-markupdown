I was advised to enter this as a bug here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16618316/how-can-scalac-be-used-on-a-source-with-spaces-in-it .

I am running scalac from command prompt.
Cygwin:
{noformat}
$ ./scala-2.11.1/bin/scalac.bat "some file.scala"
file.scala]==[-toolcp] was unexpected at this time.

$ ./scala-2.11.1/bin/scalac "some file.scala"
error: source file 'some file.scala' could not be found
one error found
{noformat}
