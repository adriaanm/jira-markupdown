This is certainly confusing, but I don't think it is a bug. When you navigate `.owner.owner`, you get to the package class of the root package, not the root package itself. The package class is named `TypeName("<root>")`, whereas the root package is named `TermName("_root_")`. The term is the only one of these name that is designed to be referenced from user code, so it used underscores rather than `<..>`.
