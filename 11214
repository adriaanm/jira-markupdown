@puffnfresh, I've been thinking how to implement your request. As experience has shown, it is particularly tricky to magically create new methods in a compiler plugin, so this should probably be a standalone library unrelated to paradise that backports reflection improvements from 2.11 to 2.10. What other functionality from 2.11 would you like to see available in 2.10?
