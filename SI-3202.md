source:scala/trunk/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.scala@21137#L572
reads
```scala
@deprecated("use `Either.separate' instead")
def separate[A,B](es: Iterable[Either[A, B]]): (List[A], List[B]) =
```
but there is no `Either.separate` to call (see source:scala/trunk/src/library/scala/Either.scala@21137) nor anything that looked appropriate.
(In r21230) Noticed we still have a bunch of collection classes which
are rather lacking.  Did some integration, added some companion
objects.  Not thrilled with the overall picture in there,
there's still a lot which should be done.  Updated a deprecation
message, closes #3202.  No review.
