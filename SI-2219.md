abstract class test {
  
    def f[U](u:U,p:Int) : U = u
    
    def g = {

        val n = 0

        def f(p:Int):Int = this.f(n,p)

        def f[U](u:U) = this.f(u,n)

        ()

    }

}

This fails to compile at def f[U](u:U) = this.f(u,n) with the error : method f is defined twice, even though the signatures are quite different and an overload should be detected.
