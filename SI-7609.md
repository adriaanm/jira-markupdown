I stumbled upon this very problem and this is very frustrating as I can't find any work around. 
Note that the issue is the same with any kind of implicit parameters (not just context bounds).

If one tries to fix the issue by resorting on macros (by doing something along the lines of `implicit def conv[T](s: String): T = macro conv_impl`,
in the vain hope that removing the implicit parameters in the function signature (now relegated to
an explicit call to inferImplicitValue/inferImplicitView inside the macro implementation "conv_impl")
would help, then deception ensues: this does not work either.

And of importance is the fact that when trying this macro implementation, one can see that the target type `T` is infered as "Nothing", thus preventing 
to write any working implementation of this macro.

As a side note, Roman Janusz initially reported the issue on the scala-user group, and he too noticed the problem with the target type being inferred as "Nothing": https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-user/3fXswCh7Xz8

Is there any plan to work on this issue in the forseable future?

Yay, I finally figured out a workaround (been episodically thinking about this bug for some time already):

{code}
class Test {
  trait Foo[T, U]
  object Foo { implicit def foo: Foo[String, Int] = new Foo[String, Int]{} }
  implicit def conv[T, U](s: T)(implicit foo: Foo[T, U]): U = ???
  def foo(c: Int) = ???
  foo("")
}
{code}

This, however, requires a fix to SI-3346, which is a pull request currently under review: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2822. If you're interested in having this bugfix in 2.11 and have some spare time, I can elaborate on how you can help.
