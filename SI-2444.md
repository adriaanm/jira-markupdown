The following code crashes the compiler (I've tested it against 2.7.7-r18779 and 2.8.0-r18925).

{code}
object Test {

  trait Foo

  class Bar { 
    object baz extends Foo
  }

  def frob[P1, P2<:Foo](f:P1 => P2) = () 

  def main(args:Array[String]) : Unit = {
  	frob((p:Bar) => p.baz) 
  }

}
{code}

Yields: 
{code}
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$TypeError: type mismatch;

{code}

My intuition is that this should typecheck, but even if it shouldn't, it shouldn't be crashing the compiler.

If I change the argument of frob to be something other than a function type, the problem seems to go away.  
This seems related to SI-2425. I'm guessing they both unexpectedly fail the subtyping test in adapt around line 942:
{code}
          if (tree1.tpe <:< pt) adapt(tree1, mode, pt, original)
{code}

I would say that the following should hold:
{code}
p.baz.type <:< Test.Bar#baz.type
{code}

since `p : Test.Bar`

Similarly, in SI-2425, somehow, `Boolean` seems not to be a subtype of `java.lang.Object`
Also, and this is different from SI-2425, I wonder where the type `Test.Bar#baz.type` comes from, as it is not valid surface syntax...

Right, I had noticed that.

> extrapolate  in existentialAbstraction creates them, but it seems there's no subtyping rule for dealing with such types
FWIW, I would like to use such syntax.  I also need Manifests for this type, which I believe already works in 2.7.5.

proposed fix: extrapolate in existentialAbstraction created singleton types whose prefix was not stable

extrapolate now generates a wider type instead:
{code}
       val extrapolate = new TypeMap {
         variance = 1
+        override def mapOver(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
+          case SingleType(pre, sym) =>
+            val pre1 = this(pre)
+            if (!pre1.isStable) pre1.memberType(sym)
+            else super.mapOver(tp)
+          case _ => super.mapOver(tp)
+        }
{code}

It's not entirely clear to me yet whether this is the right fix, though.
the type `object Test.Bar#baz`  (TypeRef(TypeRef(ThisType(object Test),class Bar,List()),  object baz,  List())) is ok, 
but the type `Test.Bar#baz.type` (SingleType(TypeRef(ThisType(object Test),class Bar,List()),  object baz)) is not
I would actually have expected the latter type to be more "conceptually correct" than the former (should we ensure in singleType that the latter is never created, but the former is returned instead? should the subtyping rules be changed to deal with the former kind of singleton type? should we change the representation of these types to use SingleType instead of a TypeRef with a TermSymbol?)

added assert to singleType and performing an `ant strap.done` to see if there were other singleton types being generated that violate this invariant

Martin: please re-assign to me if the proposed fix is ok
Fixed in r19059. I did a slightly different change (in extrapolate):
{code}
        override def mapOver(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
          case SingleType(pre, sym) =>
            if (sym.isPackageClass) tp // short path
            else {
              val pre1 = this(pre)
              if ((pre1 eq pre) || !pre1.isStable) tp
              else singleType(pre1, sym)
            }
          case _ => super.mapOver(tp)
        }
{code}
That is, if this(pre) is not stable, we back out of the extrapolation. I believe this is more predictable than doing a memberType which would lead to another existential, but at a different place.
