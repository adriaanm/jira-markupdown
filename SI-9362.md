$ cat bug
```scala
#!/bin/bash
# to demonstrate bug, call as bug {1..10000} and notice enormous gap between Compiling and Running
echo "Compiling"
exec scala "$0" "$@"
!#
println("Running")
```
Thanks for your report, but this is a duplicate of #9279, which will be fixed in 2.11.7 (by https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4465).
