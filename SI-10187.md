These used to both be true in 2.12.0 and earlier. The change to optimize `HashMap#getOrElseUpdate` in 2.12.1 uses stale values in the `update` part.

Note that Java 9 has explicitly specced `Map#computeIfAbsent` to outlaw mutation of the map in the callback. 
[~ichoran]  [~szeiger] Could I get your opinion on this?

I'm in favour of explicitly documenting the "don't mutate in the callback" restriction. Maybe this could be documented as a general note for mutable collections that results are undefined if they are mutated during queries or iteration.

But I'd be happy to revert to the current behaviour in the 2.12.x series to be conservative.
For the record, the change in 2.12.1 was https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5528, a fix for https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-10049.

Documenting the new behavior as the default in 2.13 (and reverting in 2.12) would be a natural choice. OTOH, getOrElseUpdate is much more convenient than doing the same thing manually, so it's understandable why people would want to use it even though they do not care about the improved performance (with the limitation of not being allowed to modify the map in the callback). The only obvious places in the Scala repo where the map is mutated while computing the default value are in ProdConsAnalyzerImpl.scala and SetMapConsistencyTest.scala, in both cases using an AnyRefMap.

The latter is a regression test for https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8213 where the new behavior that we now have in HashMap was classified as a bug and consequently fixed for AnyRefMap. For the sake of consistency I suggest that we revert the change and allow mutation. Since the motivation for SI-10049 was performance of groupBy, we could explore a more directed fix, e.g. overriding groupBy in HashMap and using a private copy of getOrElseUpdate with the new semantics.
