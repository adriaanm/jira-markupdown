As an exercise, I created a pull request for Nothing (expectedType.isNothingType)
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/218
with the quick fix to raise an error.

I don't have any knowledge of the code base, so I don't know whether more work is needed for the error case.

(I'll admit to second thoughts whether the elision should just result in ElidedToNothingException. Or, analogous to NotImplementedError, call it NoLongerImplementedError...)
