currently Option only has flatten via implicit conversion to Iterable, so:
```scala
scala> Some(Some(3)).flatten
res4: Iterable[Int] = List(3)
```
I was hoping to get Some(3) back, not List(3).

flatten (or join, I don't have an opinion on the right name) seems like an essential operation to have on monadic types like Option.

see also scala/bug#661. it was closed as wontfix, but I think that's because Tony was suggesting adding lots of methods, not just this one.
