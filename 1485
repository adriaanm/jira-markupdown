A bit of digging: The error occurs when the contribution is being added to the Scala menu, when right clicking on a package inside a Scala project.

I think the reason is that while the menu itself (ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core.natures.naturePopupMenu) is contributed for objectClass=IJavaProjects only, the action (ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.ui.createInt) is enabled for objectClass=IJavaElement which will also match the IPackageFragment.
