If you go to:

http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.html

and check source code of that page you'll see:

          <title>scala.collection.immutable.List</title>

It means that title of that page incudes neither "Scaladoc" nor version of Scala this page describes. We should add this information so search engines have easier job of answering useful queries people ask like "scala list 2.9".
Greg, can I close this bug? It looks like the titles are present (and have been for some time now) -- [scaladoc nightly|http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#package] 
Or did you have something else in mind?

Edit: now that I carefully read the description I see what the problem is - the pages that appear in the frame, whose title is not displayed. I will fix the page titles.

Fixed in [eb8afde6|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/eb8afde6882a945caa029a2ea9daeb43c590f5ca].
