The toggle breadcrumb icon works as expected with the current trunk build. It's quite possible that that's a change since the 10/2/2009 you're using so please could you try it again with something more recent.

Nb. if you can't see the toggle breadcrumb icon on the toolbar it's,

  Window => Customize Perspective => Commands

and select Jave Element Presentation.
