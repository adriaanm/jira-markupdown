It would be nice if it were easy for the compiler to emit snippets that necessarily compiled.

{code}
[error] /** As seen from class string is option name, the missing signatures are as follows.
[error]  *  For convenience, these are usable as stub implementations.
[error]  */
[error]   def --?: Boolean = ???
{code}

Whatever the word is for the syntactic category of colon, the advice should compile.
