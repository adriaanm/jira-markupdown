See this example:

{code}
object Test{
 def t(i:Int):String = null
 def t[T,U](m:scala.reflect.Code[T=>U]):T=>U = null
}
{code}

Method t is overloaded twice, once with a
scala.reflect.Code parameter. If I try to call the first simple
version, everything works fine:
{code}
scala> Test.t(5)
res3: String = null
{code}
But calling the second method is not possible:
{code}
scala> Test.t(3 + (_:Int))
<console>:6: error: overloaded method value t with alternatives
[T,U](m: scala.reflect.Code[(T) => U])(T) => U <and> (i: Int)String
cannot be applied to ((Int) => Int)
      Test.t(3 + (_:Int))
{code}
Removing the first method, solves the problem, but there are many
occasions where it would be nice, if it was possible to overload such methods.

This did probably never work. I checked it with 2.7.x and 2.8 r18784.

The underlying problem is, that overload resolution was never handled these cases. To make it work Inferencer.isApplicable must treat scala.reflect.Code[T] as just T.

I attached a small patch which fixes this issue.
A patch like this is not acceptable without a change to the spec. And I am not yet convinced whether we want to burn the Code class into the spec for overloading resolution. At least I'd need to see a diff to the spec. I am closing the ticket, but a SIP would be possible.
