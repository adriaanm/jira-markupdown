I *think* this will be "reasonable" behavior.  I've documented it as such.  See: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1269

If that's pulled, this gets closed as "invalid".   The other alternative is to *ignore* exceptions completely, something that seems bad to do.  i.e. try f catch { case NonFatal(_) => }   should (hopefully) not show up anywhwere in the standard library!!!!
