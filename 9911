Actually the default arg to the constructor is never used. If the constructor is private, then the apply is not rewritten to new, neither within the companion nor within the case class itself. What is used is the public default arg to apply.

It probably shouldn't warn about the synthetic member anyway. Edit: The warning intentionally warns about unused default getters. One can also ask whether the apply defaults should forward to the ctor defaults.
