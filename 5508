Scala Language Spec ï¿½4.2:

{code}
A variable definition var x : T = _ can appear only as a member of a template. It
introduces a mutable field with type T and a default initial value. The default value
depends on the type T as follows:

   0         if T is Int or one of its subrange types,
   0L        if T is Long,
   0.0f      if T is Float,
   0.0d      if T is Double,
   false     if T is Boolean,
   {}        if T is Unit,
   null      for all other types T.
{code}

The spec agrees with the occurring behaviour, but it seems inconsistent because Nothing might be considered an uninhabited type and 
{code}
var n: Nothing = null
{code}
is also refused and
{code}
var n: Nothing = _
{code}
behaves more like
{code}
var n: Nothing = throw new NullPointerException
{code}

Maybe it would make sense to add a line to explain what happens with Nothing?
