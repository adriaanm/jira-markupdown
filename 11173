I agree. This is in fact a violation of the [specification|http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf], Sec 6.12.3:
{quote}There's one exception to this rule, which concerns assignment operators. The precedence of an assignment operator is the same as the one of a simple assignment (=). That is, it is lower than the precedence of any other operator.{quote}
And according to 6.12.4 (and naturally), += is an assignment operator: it ends with =, does not start with = and is none of <=, >=, and !=.
