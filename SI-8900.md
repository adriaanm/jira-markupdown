When using the 2.11.3 version that is currently on Maven Central or the most recent SNAPSHOT, I get an assertion failure when compiling the latest development version of our Kiama library. The build log is in the attached file, but the stack trace starts:

Forgot to say explicitly that the relevant version is the latest in this repo:

    hg clone https://code.google.com/p/kiama/

The log mentions `org.kiama.example.lambda2.LambdaTree` so I presume the crash is triggered there somewhere, but I haven't narrowed it down yet.
@lrytz We're getting a false positive from `isDelambdafyFunction`. The symbol name in question is `LambdaTests$$anonfun$org$kiama$example$lambda2$LambdaTests$$canons$1$1`. I don't have a smaller reproduction yet.
Hi @retronym, [~asloane]. The failing file is `library/src/org/kiama/example/lambda2/LambdaTests.scala`. As a reduced version, replace the content of the file by the follwing, it triggers the same error.

```scala
package org.kiama
package example.lambda2

import org.kiama.util.RegexParserTests
import scala.language.experimental.macros

class LambdaTests {
    import org.kiama.rewriting.Strategy
    def rule[T] (f : PartialFunction[T, T]) : Strategy = ???
    case class Var(x: Int)
    def canon = {
        def canons: Strategy = rule[Var] { case Var (n) => Var (n) } + canons
    }
}
```

The fishy thing is that `Strategy.+` is a macro, and I could not reproduce the failure without the macro call. So it's possible that the assertion doesn't fail on compiler-generated code.

However, the implementation of `isDelambdafyFunction` (as well as `isAnonymousFunction`) is not robust at all against false positives:
```scala
    final def isAnonymousFunction = isSynthetic && (name containsName tpnme.ANON_FUN_NAME)
    final def isDelambdafyFunction = isSynthetic && (name containsName tpnme.DELAMBDAFY_LAMBDA_CLASS_NAME)
```

So an `assert(!sym.isDelambdafyFunction)` is unsafe. I think for now we should just remove the assertion, longer term there should be a better implementation of the above.
Tony, would you be interested in adding Kiama 1.7.0 to the [community build](https://github.com/scala/community-builds) that we use to test Scala compiler? Given that you guys found a regression that none of 77 projects that are already there caught, it would be great to welcome you to the family!
Grzegorz, yes, no objections from me if you want to include Kiama in the community build. Is there anything I need to do?
