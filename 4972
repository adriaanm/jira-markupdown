a) final is not redundant for vals regardless because non-final vals can be overridden.
b) In java final means immutable (unenforced), not overridable, not extendable, and also changes synchronization semantics.  It's a busy word.
c) This aspect of scala final is not new to 2.9, it goes back to at least 2.7.
d) None of this is to say it is ideal.  It makes a certain amount of sense when you see how the pieces fit together, but nobody has ever been unsurprised to discover it.
