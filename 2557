(reopening for extempore to consider my benchmark, which uses uniformly distributed hashCode values)

Running my attached benchmark, my suggested hashset takes 30% to 40% less time.


I used Scala 2.8.0.r19890-b20091126020351 and Java 1.7.0-ea-b76 on XP
JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -XX:+PrintCompilation -server -Xbatch -XX:CICompilerCount=1"
