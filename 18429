On Unix-like systems (including Mac OS X), the Scala REPL ("scala" command) can be run from the shell by redirecting input in from a file, as in:

`scala < Test.scala`

The contents of `Test.scala` are processed by the REPL as if they were typed interactively. Once the contents of the file have been processed, the REPL exits.

This mode of using the REPL is used by my Scala Worksheet plugin for Sublime Text 3 (https://bitbucket.org/inkytonik/scalaworksheet). The output of the REPL is captured and used to associated input code with the output that it produces.

Unfortunately, this mode of execution of the REPL does not work on Windows 7, even though the Windows CMD shell supports input redirection. Anecdotally from plugin users it doesn't work on other versions of Windows too.

I have tested 2.11.0-M4 but the problem occurs in 2.10.2, 2.9.2 and the latest nightly as well.

The observed behaviour on Windows 7 is that the REPL starts up as normal, but it behaves as if nothing was redirected in. I.e., it just goes to the prompt and waits for interactive input.

I'm not sure whether there is any specification of what the REPL should do in this circumstance, but it would be particularly useful for my plugin if it behaved on Windows the way it does on other systems. As we stand, the plugin is not usable on Windows so it's a blocker for me.
