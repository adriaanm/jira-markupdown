Given:
```scala
object SomeScalaObject extends SomeUsefulInterface {
  def doStuff = ...
}
```

This is easy in Java:
```scala
SomeScalaObject.doStuff();
```

However, this common Scala idiom makes an already bad Java situation worse:
```scala
void doStuffWithAUsefulThing(SomeUsefulInterface stuffDoer) {
  ...
}

doStuffWithAUsefulThing(SomeScalaObject$$.MODULE$$);
```

----

This is what I usually do to work around it:

Scala:
```scala
object SomeScalaObject {
  def it = this
}
```

Java:
```scala
  doStuffWithAUsefulThing(SomeScalaObject.it());
```

Can we get something similar generated for us poor borderlands refugees?  "it" is probably not an optimal name, but maybe "instance"?

Thanks!
