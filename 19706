For the following code:
{code}
object p {
  trait A {
    private[p] val m = 1
  }
}

trait B {
  val m = "1"
}
trait Mix extends p.A with B
{code}

I get the message:
{code}
  value m in trait A of type Int  and
  value m in trait B of type String
 (Note: this can be resolved by declaring an override in trait Mix.)
 trait Mix extends p.A with B
{code}

Maybe my expectations are incorrect but I expected the package protected member to never conflict with another member outside of the definition package.
