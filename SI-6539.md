One pattern used with macros is to have an unimplemented stub method that is valid only in the context of a macro and is then removed by that macro:

{code:lang=java}
trait Task[T] {
  def value: T = ???
}

val foo: Task[Int] = ...

val t: Task[Int] = task {
  foo.value + 1
}
{code}

The problem is that use of `value` outside of the macro is not caught at compile time, but at runtime.  For example, the following throws an exception at runtime because value is not used within the task macro that would otherwise remove the call to it.

{code:lang=java}
val foo: Task[Int] = ...
val i: Int = foo.value
{code}

The proposed solution is to have an annotation or some other way of telling the compiler that calls to `value` that survive typechecking are an error.  For example,

{code:lang=java}
   @compileTimeOnly("Calls to `value` must be made inside the the task macro.")
   def value: T = ???
{code}

This would be useful for standard macro-related methods like splice as well.
As a workaround, you could deprecate that method.

{code}
  scala> @deprecated("must be enclosed in M.m") def foo = 0
  warning: there were 1 deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
  foo: Int
  
  scala> import language.experimental.macros
  import language.experimental.macros
  
  scala> def mImpl(c: Context)(a: c.Expr[Any]) = c.universe.reify(())
  mImpl: (c: scala.reflect.macros.Context)(a: c.Expr[Any])c.universe.Expr[Unit]
  
  scala> def m(a: Any) = macro mImpl
  m: (a: Any)Unit
  
  scala> foo
  <console>:38: warning: method foo is deprecated: must be enclosed in M.m
                foo
                ^
  res5: Int = 0
  
  scala> m(foo)
{code}
{code}
-class deprecated(message: String = "", since: String = "") extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation
+class deprecated(message: String = "", since: String = "", fatal: Boolean = false) extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation
{code}
I agree with Jason. Just showing that implementation is similar to {{@deprecated}} is compelling enough.
Spare me the angst of boolean parameters... if you are ever tempted to go that route, please prefer
{code}
class fatallyDeprecated(...) extends deprecated
{code}
