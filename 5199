(In r24609) Fix for linked lists closes SI-4080 and proves my desire not to ship
obviously broken code is even greater than my will to hold out for any
help.  I threw in a free fix for this which I noticed while in there.

  scala> scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int]().head
  res0: Int = 0

Also was reminded how useless tests can be:

  val ten = DoubleLinkedList(1 to 10: _*)
  ten.insert(DoubleLinkedList(11))
  // Post-insert position test
  require(ten.last == 11)

Fortunately a test confirming buggy behavior still serves a purpose
by breaking when you fix the bug which allowed it to pass, thus letting
you fix the broken test too.  Life's (very) little compensations.
Linked list code should still be presumed broken.  No review.
