Attached is a patch that adds an option `-Ywarn-by-name`.  This option enables a warning when an implicit method has a call-by-name parameter.

It is a common mistake to assume an entire block will be passed to the implicit.  It is explicitly mentioned in the specification that implicits with call-by-name parameters are allowed, otherwise I would have suggested disallowing this entirely.

I see that the fix for the similar ticket #2688 was implemented in the parser, but it was easier for me to do it in !RefChecks.

It is only lightly tested.  If this patch is of interest, I'll add tests.
There are very good use cases for implicits with by-name parameters. Look for instance at how we add ::# to Streams, or consider the Scala equivalent of Ruby's unless.

Generally, I don't believe we should have many cases of warnings, or options that control them. If people care about certain issues, there's a possibility to write a lint-like tool, maybe as a plugin.
I did not realize it behaved as expected for a block when the conversion is triggered by a missing member.  That is certainly useful and not problematic.

The problem I was trying to address is restricted to when the conversion is to an expected type.  For example, this prints "side effect 1":

```scala
object ExpectedType {
  implicit def runnable(act: => Unit): Runnable =
    new Runnable { def run() = act }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val runnable: Runnable =
      {
          println("side effect 1")
          println("side effect 2")
      }
      
      if(false)
          runnable.run()
  }
}
```

Since the two cases are handled separately in the specification, what about specifying that implicits with by-name parameters are not considered for this case (situation 1 in the spec)?
i am having the same problem here:

```scala
trait Lala

class Test[ T <% Lala ]( thunk: => T ) {
   def test : Int = {
       println( "HERE" )
       val t: Lala = thunk
       42
   }
}

implicit def thunkToTest[ T <% Lala ]( thunk: => T ) = new Test( thunk )

def rara( f: Test[ _ ]) : Int = f.test

rara { println( "!!!" ); new Lala{} }
```

obviously "!!!" is printed early and not the whole curly braces block treated as the thunk. i think this is counter-intuitive. someone suggested that a call rara({ println( "!!!" ); new Lala{} }) would work, but looks rather bad will confuse people in a DSL (where they will in all other cases make calls such as lulu { ... })

if you decide not to change the behaviour, a compiler warning would be very useful. i spent half a day figuring out what was going on and till i could distill the above example.
i should point out that this is not such a synthetically constructed case. here is an example usage from my DSL

```scala
      play( server, out ) {
         val ply = PlayBuf.ar( numChannels, id, BufRateScale.kr( id ), loop = if( loop ) 1 else 0 )
         if( !loop ) FreeSelfWhenDone.kr( ply )
         ply * "amp".kr( amp )
      }
```

now this failed to work, because PlayBuf was early constructed out of the Graph context:

```scala
object DSL {
   implicit def thunkToGraphFunction[ T <% GE ]( thunk: => T ) = new GraphFunction( thunk )
   def play( target: Node = Server.default.defaultGroup, outBus: Int = 0,
             fadeTime: Option[Float] = Some( 0.02f ),
             addAction: AddAction = addToHead )( f: GraphFunction[ _ ]) : Synth =
      f.play( target, outBus, fadeTime, addAction )
}
```

note that GE is a trait to which different graph elements can be converted, e.g. number literals, a Seq[ GE ], but also the ugens like PlayBuf.

*but*, if i do instead:

```scala
object DSL {
   ...
   def play( target: Node = Server.default.defaultGroup, outBus: Int = 0,
             fadeTime: Option[Float] = Some( 0.02f ),
             addAction: AddAction = addToHead )( thunk: => GE ) : Synth =
      new GraphFunction( thunk ).play( target, outBus, fadeTime, addAction )
```

it suddenly works, the thunk is not prematurely evaluated. this is clearly inconsistent, and for the sake of DSL building, i think the implicit def thunkToGraphFunction should work exactly the same. Here is another example which *does* work:

```scala
   {
      val ply = PlayBuf.ar( numChannels, id, BufRateScale.kr( id ), loop = if( loop ) 1 else 0 )
      if( !loop ) FreeSelfWhenDone.kr( ply )
      ply * "amp".kr( amp )
   }.play( s, 0 )
```

so this last example is implicitly converted to GraphFunction (which has the play method) and the thunk captures everything inside the curly braces, not just the last line (ply * "amp".kr( amp ))...

I saw Eric's [post to scala-lang](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-language/pPGjYI6r5GE):

```scala
case class Converted[+T](t: () => T)
implicit def convert[T](t: =>T) = Converted(() => t)
  
var evaluated = false
val t: Converted[Int] = { evaluated = true; 1 }

// prints true
evaluated
```

The above behavior looks pathological given the following explicit application does not trigger the side effect:

```scala
convert { evaluated = true; 1 }
```

Here are the relevant sections in the Scala Language Specification:

```
h3. 7.3 Views

Implicit parameters and methods can also define implicit conversions called views. A view from type _S_ to type _T_ is defined by an implicit value which has function type _S=>T_ or _(=>S)=>T_ or by a method convertible to a value of that type.

Views are applied in three situations.

1. If an expression _e_ is of type _T_, and _T_ does not conform to the expression’s expected type _pt_. In this case an implicit _v_ is searched which is applicable to e and whose result type conforms to _pt_. The search proceeds as in the case of implicit parameters, where the implicit scope is the one of _T => pt_. If such a view is found, the expression _e_ is converted to _v(e)_.

....

The implicit view, if it is found, can accept is argument e as a call-by-value or as a call-by-name parameter. However, call-by-value implicits take precedence over call-by-name implicits.

h4. 4.6.1 By-NameParameters

Syntax:
{code}    ParamType ::= '=>' Type{code}

The type of a value parameter may be prefixed by _=>_, e.g. _x: => T_. The type of such a parameter is then the parameterless method type _=> T_. This indicates that the corresponding argument is not evaluated at the point of function application, but instead is evaluated at each use within the function. That is, the argument is evaluated using _call-by-name_.
```

Because the block evaluating to 1 does not conform to Converted[Int], it's the first condition of view that's being used, not the missing method or incompatible arg case. According to the spec, this converts the expression *e* to *v(e)*, which in this case is:

```scala
convert { evaluated = true; 1 }
```

Unless *t.t* is invoked, I don't see why this block should be evaluated.
```scala
val t: Converted[Int] = { evaluated = true; 1 }
```

Here, the whole code block is typed with an expected type of `Converted[Int]`. Then, inside the block, when looking at the return value, the compiler sees `1` not complying to the expected type and then introduces the conversion inside the block. Afterwards, the whole block does comply to the expected type and there is no reason to apply a view to the whole block. I think that's the reason for the current behavior and it seems to be covered by the spec.

That's just the simplest example but you may introduce many more possible levels of nesting where the expected type flows to the very inside and the implicit conversion actually should be applied inside.

See http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8487 for an older discussion as well.
In http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8487 Viktor wrote:

```
So, the reason is that the implicit conversion is applied to the result of the block.
```

And I guess Johannes is also saying that this is what happened:

```scala
val t: Converted[Int] = { evaluated = true; convert(1) }
```

According to SLS 6.11, a block _{s1; ...; sn; x }_ is an expression, which happens to have the type _T forSome {Q}_ where _T_ is the type of _x_. In terms of the type, wrapping _x_ may satisfy the typechecking, but doesn't the View spec say that _e_ is converted to _v(e)_? Even if the type is compatible, I don't think compiler can switch around sequential statement orders.
bq. I don't think compiler can switch around sequential statement orders.

I don't see where it does.

@Johannes I am trying to piece things together using only the spec. According to SLS 6.11:

```
Evaluation of the block entails evaluation of its statement sequence, followed by an evaluation of the final expression _e_, which defines the result of the block.
```

I am interpreting the above as:
1. {s1; ...; sn; x } needs to happen in sequential order
2. the whole block is one expression that's either evaluated or not evaluated. 

SLS 7.3 says
```
If such a view is found, the expression e is converted to v(e).
```
Here, I am reading that *e* is the entire {s1; ...; sn; x } since there are no special clause about expanding blocks. So it's v({s1; ...; sn; x }), and when the parameter is passed by name the entire block is still not evaluated. {s1; ...; sn; v(x) } is a close approximation, but it works only when the parameter is strictly evaluated.


@Eugene Both your points 1 and 2 are right, but the trouble is that the compiler is solving the type-check from the outside in. So it sees the block needs to have type Converted[Int], so it knows that the target type of 1 needs to be Converted[Int]. It doesn't backtrack out to the outer block when it sees that 1 does not have that type; it just applies the conversion locally.

I don't think this is a violation of the spec; the spec just says that the type of a block shall be the type of its last expression, and that view conversions work by converting `e` to `v(e)`; it seems silent on the order in which these rules should be applied when solving the type-check (unless I'm missing something).

I wonder, though, if someone were to propose clarifying the spec on this point to explicitly pull back conversions to the largest scope to which they could apply, (A) how difficult that would be to implement (I imagine non-trivial, but I don't know much about it) and (B) whether that would have other undesirable consequences.
Oh, no, it's not ambiguous at all. ‘The expected type of the final expression *e* is the expected type of the block.’ So that pushes the conversion into the block.

I suppose my wonderings still stand, but now it's a question of (probably) complicating the spec and (very probably) the implementation for gains in this particular edge case and uncertain other effects.
For a totally analogous situation that has nothing to do with either by-name or blocks:

```
scala> def noisyIdentity[A](a: A): A = { println("LOUD NOISES"); a }
noisyIdentity: [A](a: A)A

scala> implicit def intToStr(i: Int): String = { println("intToStr here"); i.toString }
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
intToStr: (i: Int)String

scala> noisyIdentity(noisyIdentity(5)): String
intToStr here
LOUD NOISES
LOUD NOISES
res0: String = 5
```

`intToStr` runs first for the same reason: in type-checking, expected types of inner expressions are determined by the expected types of outer expressions, and implicit conversions are applied as a fallback when expected types can't be satisfied.
FWIW, here's an instance in the real world where the behavior did cause some confusion:

https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issues/42

The library authors reacted quickly by changing the parameter type from being the by-name `=> Boolean` to being an unambiguous function type `() => Boolean`, but I wonder what other code uses it. I would personally appreciate a warning in those cases, especially because blocks passed to by-name parameters **do** exhibit the intuitive behavior when there's no implicit conversion.
