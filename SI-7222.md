This is a regression from 2.10.0

Hey guys!

This fails in 2.10.1-20130225-100 (3.0-RC1) but not when compiling in sbt with 2.10.0 - is that expected?

object Foo {
    val foo: Either[String, (String, String)] = Left("")
    for {
      (a, b) <- foo.right
    } yield {
      a + b
    }
}

Okay, looking through all the Either code, and actually giving it some thought.

map and flatMap on projections should return the same projection type. That's because we expect map/flatMap to be chain-able. And, you know, Functor, Monad, that stuff.

filter on Either has entirely the wrong signature and basically could only ever work accidentally. Because it returns an option, future map/flatMap stuff in the chain is on the option and that's just wrong. Filter, like map and flatMap, shouldn't change the type.

A filter with the right signature (one that returns a projection) doesn't make sense as-is because there's no zero for an Either or its projections, i.e. no equivalent of an empty List, or a None. 

We can always hack in a filter that throws an exception on mismatch, but that's ugly. Or we could add a zero to Either so that Either[String, String] is Right | Left | F-You, but that's outside the normal contract of Either and frankly is better done as Option[Either[A, B]] instead.

Dup of SI-5589, no?
Refutability doesn't make sense without types, you can't type without a filter call, ergo, you can't use refutability in this case.

I've spent a bit of time talking to Martin about this when I was investigating SI-6968. It's a can of worms. {{null}} brings additional wrinkles.

A few new ideas: {{Either#RightProjection}} could define a dummy {{filter}} method that was somehow annotated to blowup if it still existed in the tree post-refchecks (when proper irrefutability analysis is possible.)

Oh yeah, the idea of eliding the {{filter}} call in {{refchecks}} after determining irrefutability is was effectively neutered when {{withFilter}} was introduced, as `qual.withFilter(...)` and `qual` have different types, so any subsequent calls are invalid if you blindly remove {{withFilter}}. We only seemed not to notice that problem because the irrefutability check was busted. It was even more busted in 2.11 because it assumed that pattern matching translation hadn't happened yet.

Did I mention canned worms? It all comes down to blindly making decisions about the for rewriting without types.

Oh well, at least the Haskell guys have a similar problem :)

To explain more precisely, in the 2.10.0 window, a for-comprehension with a tuple-pattern binding that consists strictly of variables (or wildcards) erroneously did not result in a call to withFilter (or, in casu, filter). The translation was performed on a purely syntactic basis, but would lead to unexpected MatchErrors as illustrated by Jason:

{code}
// 2.9.2, 2.10.1
scala> for ((a, b) <- List[Any](0)) yield a
res0: List[Any] = List()

// 2.10.0
scala> for ((a, b) <- List[Any](0)) yield a
scala.MatchError: 0 (of class java.lang.Integer)
{code}

If we leave the 2.10.0 bug in place, we let buggy code that could only have been written in the couple of months that 2.10.0 is out, fester until we fix it in 2.11. 

As always, we're talking trade-offs here. I did not intend "drop-in replacement" as a legal term. I should have qualified it with "modulo bad bugs that are expected to cause more pain than sticking to our doctrine".

So, to get back to your example, as soon as the pattern becomes non-trivial, 2.10.0's behavior matches that of 2.9/2.10.1:

{code}
scala> object Foo {
     |     val foo: Either[String, (String, String)] = Right(("a", "b"))
     |     def res = for {
     |       ("a", b) <- foo.right
     |     } yield {
     |       b
     |     }
     | }
<console>:10: error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : (T1, T2)
 required: scala.util.Either[Nothing,(String, String)]
             ("a", b) <- foo.right
             ^
{code}

This is because the signature of RightProjection's filter is not what you might expect: it returns an Option[Either[A, B]], so the subsequent map must deal with a full Either, not just the element on the right. I had to desugar the for comprehension to make it work because this kind of definition of filter just doesn't work with for comprehensions (it can't change the "type in the monad". There, I said "monad".).

{code}
scala>   foo.right filter {
     |     case ("a", b) => true
     |     case _ => false
     |   } map {
     |     case Right((a, b)) => a + b
     |   }
<console>:12: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: Left(_)
                } map {
                      ^
res1: Option[String] = Some(ab)
{code}
