"When in doubt, check what java does", that's the usual rule for those things.

The JLS says in [ยง15.19|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.19] that

_Binary numeric promotion (ยง5.6.2) is *not* performed on the operands._

So Scala just does what Java does. I am not sure why Java does that though.
