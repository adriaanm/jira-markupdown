The quoted commit made {{Array.unzip}} require a ClassTag. The ClassTag is required so unzip can have precise return type as requested in SI-8081. The error message is misleading due to failure of type inference caused by suboptimal signature of {{ArrayOps.unzip}} method.

Strictly speaking, the change made in b8a76f688c6ce2a4c305da064303bb46b53be875 broke source compatibility but I think that's ok in this case. What needs fixing is signature of {{ArrayOps.unzip}} method so proper error message is printed.
