@shaberman:

This is a duplicate of scala/bug#2767 and the the example you provide translated to Scala is the simplest code that triggers this long standing bug.

A HUGE thanks for submitting this bug report!

@milessabin:

This is a duplicate of scala/bug#2767 and provides the much awaited simple code example that reproduces the Clean&Build bug.

To reproduce the bug use:
```scala
// file: /src/A.scala
class A {
  var a = 10
}
```

and 
```scala
// file: /src/B.scala
class B {
  val a = new A
}
```

After saving B, do a Clean&Build and you will get a bogus error message in the editor saying: "A does not have a constructor".
