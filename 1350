Surprisingly enough, this actually is meaningful.  Consider
```scala
package a
class A {
  protected private[a] val x : Int = 0
}
```
Here subclasses of `A` in package `a` can access x, but subclasses of `A` outside of package `a` cannot, and everyone that is not a subclass of `A` cannot access it.
