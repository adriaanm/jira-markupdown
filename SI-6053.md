The toString for Manifest was suboptimal in many ways, but it was passable for showing a type to a user.  The structural string for the Type underlying the TypeTag is not passable except for debugging.  Type should provide a readable string method in addition to the current structural string method.

TypeTag.toString:

```java
scala> val t = implicitly[reflect.TypeTag[Seq[String]]]
t: reflect.TypeTag[Seq[String]] = TypeTag[TypeRef(ThisType(class collection),class Seq,List(TypeRef(ThisType(class lang),class String,List())))]
```

Manifest.toString:
```java
scala> val m = implicitly[reflect.Manifest[Seq[String]]]
m: scala.reflect.Manifest[Seq[String]] = scala.collection.Seq[java.lang.String]
```

The underlying Type does preserve the structure so one could probably write a custom toString if absolutely necessary, unlike Manifest.  However, I'd rather not duplicate (poorly) the existing compiler code for displaying a type in a readable manner (FunctionN/TupleN, omitting java.lang. and scala. , ...).
