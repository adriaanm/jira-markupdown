The getter call is replaced by {{BoxedUnit.UNIT}} because {{isExprSafeToInline}}. I'm not sure if that's intentional, the [doc comment|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.1/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/TreeInfo.scala#L159-L166] says

"References to modules [] are side-effecting [] but they are safe to inline because the expression result from evaluating them is always the same"
