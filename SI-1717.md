This happens since r17107. Easier explained with an example. Start from:
 
{code}
class Bar {

  def baz = {

  }
}
{code}

Now add in baz:

{code}
    val s = "sed"
{code}

The editor will show:

{code}
    val s = "se"
{code}

If you select the text, it fixes itself. It seems like some update is being missed.
