This happens since r17107. Easier explained with an example. Start from:
 
```scala
class Bar {

  def baz = {

  }
}
```

Now add in baz:

```scala
    val s = "sed"
```

The editor will show:

```scala
    val s = "se"
```

If you select the text, it fixes itself. It seems like some update is being missed.
