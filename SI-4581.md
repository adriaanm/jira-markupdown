Having the @static annotation would fill one feature of the JVM not possible in Scala.

For practicality, it will help in these cases:
1. Some libraries require a static field. In particular, the android SDK requires classes implementing the Parceable interface to have a CREATOR static field

2. It will allow to create utility methods that are available "idiomatically" from Java code

I know that theoretically one can create a compiler plugin to do this. But there are few people that know how to do this.

Another area where @static will help is remove the SerialVersionUID annotation. Instead users will just write:
```scala
  @static private val serialVersionUID = 432525L
```

Writing it java is always an option... But having a module that has some files in Java and some in Scala sounds icky to me (esp. compilation of both). 

I'm pleased to see the inclusion of the @static annotation in Scala 2.10.0-M6. I noticed that @static vals don't get marked final, which limits HotSpot optimizations and jeopardizes the fabric of the cosmos. Heads up!

```scala
object Constants {
  import scala.annotation.static
  @static val Const: Int = 0 // should generate a static final field
  @static final val FinalConst: Int = 0 // ditto
}
```

```scala
public class Constants {
  public static int Const;

  public static int FinalConst;

  public static {};
    Code:
       0: iconst_0      
       1: putstatic     #11                 // Field Const:I
       4: iconst_0      
       5: putstatic     #14                 // Field FinalConst:I
       8: return        

  public Constants();
    Code:
       0: aload_0       
       1: invokespecial #17                 // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
       4: return        
}
```
