difference: correlation between object and companion class's self type

why not let objects override each other?
un-finalize objects, could assume objects pre-version-that-has-overridable-objects are final (bump classfile version)

what about super calls? (can't call super on vals of any kind right now, for lazy vals there were hard technical reasons for this, would be nice to solve it but known to be very hard)
