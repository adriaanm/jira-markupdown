Using Scala 2.9.0, the following code compiles when entering it in the REPL using :paste mode. However, saving it into a file and loading it in the REPL using :load, gives an error:
```scala
case class A(i1: Int, i2: Int)

object A {
  def apply(i: Int): A = A(i, i)
}
```
```scala
scala> :load A.scala
Loading A.scala...
defined class A
<console>:8: error: too many arguments for method apply: (i: Int)A in object A
         def apply(i: Int): A = A(i, i)
```

It looks like the lines in the file are loaded and interpreted one by one, which for companion object does not work in the in the REPL. It would be nice if this would work as well.
