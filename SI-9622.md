 
@native private def sampleMethod(argOne: Long): Int

private def sampleMethod(argOne: Long): Int

Above declarations gives the following compiler error

 

    abstract member may not have private modifier @native private def sampleMethod(argOne: Long): Int 

 

What is the proper way of declaring native private member method or private member


Note:
@native protected def sampleMethod(argOne Long): Int compiles


   
@native private def sampleMethod(argOne: Long): Int = 0 compiles but doesn't generate byte code entry

       
 @native private def sampleMethod(argOne: Long): Int = _   gives following error


                 unbound placeholder parameter @native private def sampleMethod(argOne: Long): Int = _ -

Can anyone explain the rational  behind this behavior 
[This refactor](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/290f687fb6ab91b6aef62d871036ddc3829f12b4) correctly resets the deferred flag when native, but checkWithDeferred assumes deferred, see [Namers](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Namers.scala#L1652)
