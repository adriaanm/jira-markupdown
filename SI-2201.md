The implicits cache from current development versions doesn't properly take into account that the implicit parameter might contain (own) symbols.

It's pretty easy to reproduce the problem:

{code}
class Test
object Test { implicit def view(x : Test) = 0 }

object Call {
  def call(implicit view : Test => Int) = view(null)
  call
  call
}
{code}

This will cause a "no-symbol does not have owner" error in the lambda lifting stage. Output with "-uniqid -print:typer":

{code}
[...]
	CallSI-7515.this.callSI-10687({
		((xSI-11869: TestSI-7512) => TestSI-7513.viewSI-10678(xSI-11869))
	});
	CallSI-7515.this.callSI-10687({
		((xSI-11869: TestSI-7512) => TestSI-7513.viewSI-10678(xSI-11869))
	})
[...]
{code}

Scala is clearly re-using the same parameter symbols for the two "call" calls. This confuses the lambda lifter. Further damage is done once the two calls are in different scopes.

As it's pretty hard to get around this bug for what I'm trying to do, I have created a crude compiler patch that reincarnates all parameter symbols for results taken from the implicits cache (attached).
I think the patch is basically OK, but there's too much needless copying.

{code}
/** Construct a fresh symbol tree for an implicit parameter */  
 	657	    def fixSymbols(tree : Tree) : Tree = new Transformer { 
 	658	        currentOwner = context.owner 
 	659	        override val treeCopy = new StrictTreeCopier 
                        ^^^ I think a lazy tree copier is sufficient here
 	660	        override def transform(tr : Tree) = super.transform(tr match { 
 	661	                case Function(vparams, body) => { 
 	662	                        // New tree 
 	663	                        val sym = tr.symbol.cloneSymbol(currentOwner) 
 	664	                        val res = tr.duplicate setSymbol sym 
 	665	                        // New parameter symbols 
 	666	                        var oldsyms = vparams.map(_.symbol) 
 	667	                        var newsyms = oldsyms.map(_.cloneSymbol(sym)) 
 	668	                        // Fix all symbols 
 	669	                        new TreeSymSubstituter(oldsyms, newsyms).traverse(res) 
 	670	                        res 
 	671	                } 
 	672	                case other => other.duplicate
                                ^^^ I don't see why you duplicate here. 
 	673	        }) 
 	674	    }.transform(tree) 
{code}
Paul, do you want to try with the modified patch? Thanks! -- Martin
There are three test failures with the modified (or unmodified) patch in effect.
{code}
files/pos/manifest1.scala
files/run/names-defaults.scala
files/jvm/manifests.scala
{code}
Two involve manifests, and one looks like an issue with implicits+defaults where there is no implicit available: the method it's trying to call is:
{code}
  def test9(implicit x: Int = 1, z: String = "klfj") = z + x

// and calling it outputs:
a.scala:216: error: type mismatch;
 found   : <notype>
 required: String
{code}

I put the failure output up here: http://www.improving.org/scala/bug2201-output.txt .  I don't have enough of a handle on this to intuit what else needs to be done.
I think there is a deeper problem of over-aggressive implicit caching. The solution of  copying the symbols doesn't work in the general case -- see the test case I added to SI-2316.
