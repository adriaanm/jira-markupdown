Similar to SI-5018.

Use {code}.mapValues( ... ).map(identity){code} as a workaround
I also run into this. I have many maps that I'm serializing so the workaround (.map(identity)) starts to feel _very_ stupid.
Latest discussion is one further link away: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2308. But basically, the current implementation is a view and can't be made Serializable safely, because closures as a rule can't be serialized or might be hugely expensive.

See also https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4776.
@Rex, as was pointed out two years ago, {{mapValues(...).map(identity)}} will force conversion to a serializable instance.  Renaming this to {{force}} is not really a solution.
Indeed, there aren't perfect solution with this interface. A sensible interface for serialization when closures are involved is a hard problem â€” in fact, it's one of the problems that [~heathermiller] [~hmiller] (what's the right account?) has been working on with [spores](
http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/spores.html). Spores would solve the problem I described earlier:

> But basically, the current implementation is a view and can't be made Serializable safely, because closures as a rule can't be serialized or might be hugely expensive.

by giving the programmer control over what gets in a closure. Yes, that's annoying, but things can't be perfect.
Hence, I suspect one should just pick some (imperfect) solution here, and try to design a proper spore-based interface as a proper fix.
But now that I pointed out the connection, maybe Heather can weigh in with her opinion?

[Here's](https://github.com/heathermiller/spores) the current implementation of spores.
(Sorry I can't be bothered to relearn JIRA's link syntax).

In a perfect world, the type system could maybe distinguish between serializable and not serializable map values, depending on whether all involved closures are serializable. But this seems a follow-up research project, if it's actually plausible at all.
Is this differed from 2.12 because of lack of bandwidth or because there is no agreement on solution? 
As I constantly suffer from this issue, I would gladly assist. If I make a pull request to make the result of mapValues materialize on serialization is there a reasonable chance of it being merged? 

I don't think that making {{mapValues}} strict in 2.12 would pass reviews. The real fix is a more comprehensive rework, basically fixing SI-4776. A rework of collections is on the roadmap for 2.13, and fixing issues with views is one of the main program points. CC [~szeiger].
I wasn't suggesting making mapValues strict. I was suggesting to write the result when serializing (Getting something not identical, but equal when deserializing). 
I think serialization of non strict collection is a fundamental issue, exasperated in this case when the type system gives us no hint to the problem. 
I think materializing when serializing is not a bad behavior, the only alternative I can think of is trying to serialize the function optimistically (many serialize just fine). 
Materializing on serialization might be less clean, but it is far more useful, especially for novices who want things to "just work". 

It seems very strange that {{mapValues}} and {{filterKeys}} are not strict: Scala's collections are usually strict unless you request a view. This unexpected behavior seems like a recipe for subtle, unexpected bugs. However, [~meirmaor]'s suggestion to at least have a strict serialization mechanism seems like a reasonable workaround if fixing {{mapValues}} isn't in the cards.
