By the way, Daniel Sobral pointed out on Twitter that ${From} is not used in the annotation message:
```scala
@implicitNotFound(msg = "Cannot construct a collection of type ${To} with elements of type ${Elem} based on a collection of type ${To}.")
```

Maybe the second ${To} was meant to be ${From}?
