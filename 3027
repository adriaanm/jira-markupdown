Thanks, but that doesn't answer my question ;-)

I suspect that the fix for scala/bug#2931 will have improved the situation for this ticket as well, but there are still likely to be issues in the presentation compiler with types which are contained in source files which aren't named for the type.

If automatic building is enabled, then the class file generated for such a type will provide a reference back to the source file it was built from irrespective of the source file name. But if there's no class file there's no way (currently) for the presentation compiler to locate the source file for a given type (unless it already knows about it because that type's source file is open in an editor).

Hopefully that gives you some context for my previous request ...
