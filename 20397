Scala should print usage information to stdout instead of stderr. While errors about command line arguments should be printed to stderr, when explicitly asked for help this info should go to stdout. This allows it to be piped to grep or less, etc. It's also in the GNU coding standards, and seems to be a lot more useful in general.
