This works for me: ctrl-/ toggles "//" comments on the selection, ctrl-shift-/ wraps the selection with "/* ... */" comments and ctrl-shift-\ unwraps a "/* ... */" commented selection.

It's possible that the Java editor behaviour that's driving this is getting confused by some aspect of Scala syntax, so if you have an example of this failing it'd be very useful to see it.
