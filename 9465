related question:

Most of the time, Typers uses {{context.makeNewScope}}, which calls {{newNestedScope(scope)}}. Howeve, the context created to type check a template (in typedClassDef and typedModuleDef) is created using {{context.make(.., .., newScope)}}, i.e. a non-nested scope. (Namers is equivalent).

I have no idea why this distinction is made, anybody who has could add a comment to the source code :)
