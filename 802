Reopened to change status since martin just changed the parser.  You can now end a string with as many quotes as you want, which means you can put a triple quote in a triple quoted string, as long as you don't mind it being the last thing!
{code}
scala> val tquote = """""""""
tquote: java.lang.String = """
{code}
