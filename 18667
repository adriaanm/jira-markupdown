Ready for this? This is a good one.

{noformat}
scala> Vector() ++ Iterator(1)
res9: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector(1)

scala> Vector() ++ Iterator(1, 2)
res10: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector(1, 2)

scala> Vector() ++ Iterator(1, 2, 3)
res11: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector()
{noformat}

was fine in 2.11.0-M5.

I can't seem to find another combination of types besides Vector + Iterator on which it fails
