Would upgrading the library be too disruptive for 2.10? Having to maintain different ForkJoin versions for different versions of Scala doesn't sound too great to me.

Considering that the JSR166 stuff is all in public domain, starting to use the bundled version of ForkJoin (where available) seems fine (imho).
