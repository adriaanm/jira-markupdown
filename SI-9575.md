I expected `a zip b` in the following snippet to return `Option[(Int,Int)]`

```scala
scala> val a = Some(1)
a: Some[Int] = Some(1)

scala> val b = Some(2)
b: Some[Int] = Some(2)

scala> a zip b
res0: Iterable[(Int, Int)] = List((1,2))

```

This is not intuitive and even the docs state that it should have returned an `Option` (http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option).
This was reported in [SI-8394](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8394).
