Upon starting eclipse with the attached source files, when highlighting the file NaiveHeap.scala, I get a dialog saying "Presentation compiler error.  Reason: assertion failed".  The .metadata/.log file is also attached.  I think the error results from a typo I made on line 24 of NaiveHeap.scala, writing LeftistHeap instead of Heap.  Perhaps there is some odd typing circularity here...

The error still occurs in the latest version of the plugin (2.7.0.14321-final_0).  To reproduce:

1. Extract the attached zip into an empty scala eclipse project.
2. Open the NaiveHeap.scala files in a window in eclipse.
3. Close eclipse.
4. Start eclipse.
5. On opening, it will show the NaiveHeap.scala window and give the error attached.
