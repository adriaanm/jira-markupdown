=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Try to compile the following code:
{code}
import scala.util.continuations._

object CTest {
    def main_loop: Nothing = reset {
        shift { k: (Unit => Nothing) => k() }
        main_loop
    }

    def main(argv: Array[String]) = {main_loop}
}

{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Compiling successfully

=== What do you see instead? ===

{code}
error: type mismatch;
 found   : ((Unit) => Nothing) => Nothing
 required: ((Unit) => B) => Nothing
        shift { k: (Unit => Nothing) => k()}
{code}

=== Additional information ===
The following code works as expected:
{code}
import scala.util.continuations._

object CTest {
    def main_loop: Nothing = reset {
        shift[Unit, Nothing, Nothing] { k => k() }
        main_loop
    }

    def main(argv: Array[String]) = {main_loop}
}

{code}
