using a function passed as a parameter in 1.5x to 2.0x slower than passing in a class and using the function directly.

I was trying to use Scala for algorithm implementations and had made all my cost functions values that were passed into the algorithm. This caused the algorithm to run almost two times slower. First I thought it was Scala was slower than Java, but on further investigation, it turns out that passing a function in as a value is almost two times slower than passing in a class and using the function directly on the class.

I have included a test program that runs two versions of the Greedy 2-Opt algorithm. One uses the cost function on a class that is passed in as a parameter. The other has the costFunction passed in directly.

The results are self-explanatory.
