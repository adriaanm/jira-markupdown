It is impossible to define a macro inside a class with an AnyVal parameter, referencing an object with the same name as the class.
This fails to compile with: "error: an expression of type Null is ineligible for implicit conversion"
```scala
class Foo(a: Boolean /* or Int or Double or ...*/) {
    def bar = macro Foo.impl
    def baz = macro OtherObject.impl   //works
}
```

If the AnyVal parameter is replaced with AnyRef or a subclass of AnyRef, the error message is "error: not found: value Foo", as intended.
Additionally,
```scala
class Foo[A <: Boolean](a: A) { ... } 
```
fails with right error message.
