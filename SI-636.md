I have to keep my scala.plugin build on 1.4 given the following code:
```scala
  private class BreakpointLocationVerifierJob(document : IDocument, breakpoint : Any, lineNumber : Int, typeName : String, resource : IResource, editorPart : IEditorPart) extends Job("Add breakpoint")  { ... }
```
which leads to the following error:

object creation impossible, since method compareTo in trait Comparable of type (T)Int is not defined

Eclipse is completely raw type, so Job inherits (and implements!) java.lang.Comparable without a raw type. The compiler falsely flags this as an error as it doesn't associate the Java implemented compareTo method in the Java code of the Job class with the compareTo method in the Comparable interface. Trying to implement the method myself is impossible, e.g.,:
```scala
  private class BreakpointLocationVerifierJob(document : IDocument, breakpoint : Any, lineNumber : Int, typeName : String, resource : IResource, editorPart : IEditorPart) extends Job("Add breakpoint")  {
    def run(monitor : IProgressMonitor) : IStatus = Status.OK_STATUS
    override def compareTo(x : Any) : Int = super.compareTo(x)
  }
```

just doesn't see compareTo as an overriding method, as does re-implementing the comparable interface:

```scala
  private class BreakpointLocationVerifierJob(document : IDocument, breakpoint : Any, lineNumber : Int, typeName : String, resource : IResource, editorPart : IEditorPart) extends Job("Add breakpoint") with java.lang.Comparable[Job]  {
    def run(monitor : IProgressMonitor) : IStatus = Status.OK_STATUS
    override def compareTo(x : AnyRef) : Int = super.compareTo(x)
  }
```

Which leads to the following confused error message:

{code}
illegal inheritance;
 self-type BreakpointAdapterFactory.this.BreakpointLocationVerifierJob does not conform to java.lang.Comparable[org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.Job]'s selftype java.lang.Comparable[org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.Job]}}


Yeah, this seems to work fine now.
Foo.java:
```scala
class Foo implements Comparable {
  public int compareTo(Object that) {
    return 0;
  }
}
```
Bar.scala:
```scala
class Bar extends Foo {
  val x = this.compareTo(new AnyRef)
}
```
Reopen if you have a self-contained example that still doesn't work.
