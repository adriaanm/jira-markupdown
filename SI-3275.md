Compiling with 2.8.0.Beta1, if I use @scala.annotation.tailrec on a function that doesn't recurse, the compiler simply tells me that it cannot optimise it. It would be very useful if the compiler were able to tell me that this is because the function doesn't recurse.

The use case may sound silly - why annotate the function if it's not recursive? - but it has happened to me a few times where I have refactored a recursive function to no longer recurse, and then scratched my head for a while after getting the compile error.
(In r21599) Improved @tailrec error messages to specify the reason.
In the process fixed old bug involving tail call transformation.
Closes SI-3275, SI-2018.  Review by dragos.
Reopening: when @tailrec is used on a non-recursive method, the default error message is still used: "it contains a recursive call not in tail position".

From {{TailCalls.scala}}:

{code}
else if (!isRecursiveCall) {
  if (receiverIsSuper) failHere("it contains a recursive call targetting a supertype")
  else failHere(defaultReason)
}
{code}

I haven't done any scalac hacking, but I assume this is the spot where you'd want to say "method is non-recursive."
