Reformatted code to reproduce bug:

{code}
val bigmap = Map[Int,Int] ++ (0 to 7000 map (i=>(i,i))) 
val submap = bigmap filter (_._2>6000) 
println ("Filtered map has " + submap.size + " entries") 
//filter again 
val submap1 = bigmap filter (_._2>6000) //will fail 
println ("Filtered map has " + submap1.size + " entries") 
{code}
