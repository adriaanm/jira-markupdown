Because some IDEs have problems with starting fsc, I always start it from command line by running
{code}
touch tmp.scala
fsc tmp.scala
rm tmp.scala
{code}
since fsc needs at least one source file in order to start, even if you don't want to compile something right now.

So the perfect solution would be to provide a command line option "-start" (cf. "-shutdown") that does not require source any files to start the background service.
