Signing applets is really not a solution here. We won't do that, and probably many other applet creators won't do that, because:

1. signed applets display additional prompt to the user on startup, and there is no way to get rid of that - it is telling the user something like "hello, I'm allowed to break your computer or delete your documents, if you trust me I won't do that, press ok". 
2. signed applets load slower than unsigned because of additional certificate checking
3. the most important thing: we really don't need any additional functionality of signed applets, except this Actor thing now ;) Even reflection, client side storage and local clipboard access work fine in unsigned applets.

Getting a different framework is probably ok, we will have to investigate a little. Thanks for the suggestion. :)
UPDATE: Uh, oh, Akka is 13 MB large, Scalaz is 8.4 MB, Lift is even bigger. After proguarding + pack200, that probably won't make below 1 MB, which means *doubling* our application size. :(

BTW: Except the compatibility issue with unsigned applets, I see another issue here: accessing sun.* classes is not portable even in unrestricted environment, so the actor framework might actually fail in some other non Sun/Oracle JVMs. Even in the new versions of JVM, Oracle is free to remove / add / change classes in the sun.* package.
