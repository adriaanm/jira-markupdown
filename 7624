you can get the same crash in the REPL in both M3 and M4 (but not M2) with even simpler code, e.g.

{noformat}
List(1).reduceLeft(_ + _)
{noformat}

the exact details don't seem to matter here (you can substitute Stream for List, String for Int, fold for reduce, etc.)

the same bug, or maybe just closely related?
