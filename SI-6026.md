In scala 2.9.2 REPL this works
This is what I got last summer, too.

You go, "How could that not work?" and then you're sucked in.

I'm pretty sure there's a horror flick where one of the young naifs says, "How could that not work?" and starts to fiddle, and the audience screams at the screen, "No!  Don't fiddle!"

Avoid the class loader bug by not creating a new loader if javap is available on the interpreter's class path.

It might be nice to back port the bug fix for AFCL, too.

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3052

This lets you work around the bug by `scala -toolcp tools.jar` instead of other gymnastics.

Supplemented by

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3053

which backports the `findResource` for AFCL.  The use case should just work now.
