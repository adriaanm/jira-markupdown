You need to add the `final` modifier to the value definitions in the scala objects.

From the specification:

> A constant value definition is of the form
> [[BR]]
> `final val x = e`
> [[BR]]
> where `e` is a constant expression (ï¿½6.24). The final modifier must be present and no type annotation may be given.
