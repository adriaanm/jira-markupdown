I'm using the eclipse beta plugin version found with eclipse's Find and install tool on 2008-05-09. 

When I start a new block and press enter after the first opening brace it indents by 3 spaces even if I have defined tabs to be used with 4 spaces in eclipse's general editor preferences. So the the first problem is that plugin doesn't offer indentation preferences and neither is using general preferences. 

The second problem is that when I try to press tab on the situation described above it doesn't indent with neither spaces or tabs. Not that it would be useful to indent more than one step in a new block but the user should still have a choice.

Example situation:
```scala
def foo = {
    
  }
```
