Weary of endless github wars over comment formatting? Wouldn't it be nice if Scala recovered the semicolon, which is on the brink of extinction, for line comments? Only if it is the leading non-whitespace.

{code}
  // boring
  val x = 42

  /** Annoying sparkles in my eyes.
    * With the weird indentation.
    */
  val y = 17

  ; exciting! punctuated equilibrium in language evolution
  ; I could go on and on about how it doesn't look like Java.
  def z = ???

  ; I space them qua separators
  for (v <- vs ; w <- ws if v < w) yield (v, w)
{code}
I would also love to see

{noformat}
REM my commet
{noformat}

That would really help with the context switching on those days where you go back and forth between batch scripts and Scala.
Double semi is especially useless, pace the original reporter.

{code}
;; looks like a walrus in certain fonts, I think
;; two eyes and cute little tusks
;; or possibly that weird spider with the beady eyes
def iam = "walrus"
{code}

That works if Scala doesn't adopt forever syntax, {{for (;; )}}. Extra space to avoid winky emoji.

I often accidentally insert `//` in my shell scripts, so it would be great if double hash were also supported. It could resolve to {{this.##}} if that typechecks and a line comment otherwise.

The recovering bashistas are formally requesting {{#}} for single-line comments.
