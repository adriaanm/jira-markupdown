In the definition of `f` I should have at least proved that `R <: (Int, Int)`, if not `R <: (Int, Int) with Unit`, but that is not the case.  With 2.12.0-M1:

{code:title=Nussli.scala}
package nussli

trait Base {
  type R
}

trait A {self:A with B =>
  type R <: (Int, Int)
  def f(r:R) = r._1
}

trait B {
  type R <: Unit
}
```scala

yields

```
…/Nussli.scala:9: value _1 is not a member of A.this.R
  def f(r:R) = r._1
                 ^
{code}

Also affects 2.11.7, 2.10.5, 2.9.3.

Found by Marc-Antoine Nüssli [in this scala-user post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-user/gyIjIeUxYd4/sVi6iM4KWjoJ), which contains a longer example of failing code.
If you want `A`-s defintion of R to be first in the linearization order of the type of `this.type`, you need to define it as:

```scala
package nussli
 
trait Base {
  type R
}
 
trait A {self: B with A =>
  type R <: (Int, Int)
  def f(r: A.this.R) = r._1
}
 
trait B {
  type R <: Unit
}
```

Note that these are equivalent:

```scala
trait A {self: B => }
trait A {self: A with B => }
```

Here's the code that computes the self type, based on the self type annotation and the type of the class itself:
```scala
    def selfTypeCompleter(tree: Tree) = mkTypeCompleter(tree) { sym =>
      val selftpe = typer.typedType(tree).tpe
      sym setInfo {
        if (selftpe.typeSymbol isNonBottomSubClass sym.owner) selftpe
        else intersectionType(List(sym.owner.tpe, selftpe))
      }
    }
```

This is inline with the spec for self types: http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#templates

It's also worth noting that while the inconsistency in the type members is allowed in the intersection type of a self type, it is not allowed in a base type sequence of a class.

```scala

class D extends B with A // error: type R in trait A with bounds <: (Int, Int) has incompatible type
class E extends A with B // error: type R in trait B with bounds <: Unit has incompatible type
```

As noted in http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#overriding, an additional overriding member is required:
```scala
class F extends B with A {
  type R <: (Int, Int) with Unit // okay
}
class G extends A with B {
  type R <: (Int, Int) with Unit // okay
}
```


So I think this is "not a bug", albeit somewhat unintuitive.
Actually, I really think it is a bug. Even if A's definition of R is not first in linearization, it should not be hidden. Only the last definition of R is seen by the compiler, which is quite annoying. Consider the following variation:

```scala
trait S1 {def v1:Any}
trait S2 {def v2:Any}

trait A {self: B with A =>
  type R <: S2
  def f(r: R) = r.v2               //compiles using self declaration: B with A
  def g(r: R) = r.v1              //compiles using self declaration: A with B
}
  
trait B {
  type R <: S1
}
```

Actually, it seems it is a quite important problem with Scala type system. Someone directed me to #7255 which contains details about that problem...
