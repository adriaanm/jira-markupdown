I think this might be related to some of the issues uncovered in SI-5488.

The basic gist is that while AnyRef specialization is working for simple type combinations (e.g. @specialized(Int, AnyRef) it seems to be breaking for "full specialization". Here's the code:

{code}
import scala.{specialized => spec}

// specialized on Int/AnyRef only
class C1[@spec(Int, AnyRef) A, @spec(Int, AnyRef) B](v:A, w:B)

// specialized on everything
class C2[@spec(Unit, Boolean, Byte, Char, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, AnyRef) A, @spec(Unit, Boolean, Byte, Char, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, AnyRef) B](v:A, w:B)

// specialized on everything except AnyRef
class C3[@spec(Unit, Boolean, Byte, Char, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double) A, @spec(Unit, Boolean, Byte, Char, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double) B](v:A, w:B)

object Test {
  def main(args:Array[String]) {
    // as expected, this specializes properly to C1$mcLI$sp
    println(new C1("abc", 123).getClass.getName)

    // this tries to use C2$mcLI$sp but fails to compile due to a bug
    println(new C2("abc", 123).getClass.getName)
    //test.scala:18: error: type mismatch;
    // found   : String("abc")
    // required: A$sp
    //    println(new C3("abc", 123).getClass.getName) // explodes
    //            ^
    //one error found

    // as expected, this uses the generic C3
    println(new C3("abc", 123).getClass.getName)
  }
}
{code}

Commenting out the second println allows the whole thing to compile and run as expected.

This error crops up when substituting C2$mcLI$sp for C2 in the tree, and the typing the new tree. I'm not sure why it works for C1 but not for C2. The trees look the same, at least as far as I can tell (e.g. using log output). Probably I need to figure out how to hook up a debugger and take a closer look.
Well, at this point I have traced the problem back to the typer incorrectly deciding the type of C2$mcLI$sp's constructor, despite getting it right in the case of C1$mcLI$sp. The difference between C1 and C2 is that the typer substitutes String for A$sp whereas in C2 it doesn't.

The relevant typer debug output of C1 looks like:

{code}
    typing new <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String].<init>("abc", 123): pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=false, silent=false, context.owner=method main
[log explicitouter] [context] ++ test.scala / Apply
        typing new <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String].<init>: pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=false, silent=true, context.owner=method main
            typing new <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]: pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=false, silent=true, context.owner=method main
            typed new <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]: <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]
            adapted new <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]: <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String] to ?, 
        typed new <empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String].<init>: (<param> v: lang.this.String, <param> w: scala.this.Int)<empty>.this.C1$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]
{code}

The broken typer output of C2 looks like:

{code}
    typing new <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String].<init>("abc", 123): pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=false, silent=false, context.owner=method main
[log explicitouter] [context] ++ test.scala / Apply
        typing new <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String].<init>: pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=false, silent=true, context.owner=method main
            typing new <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]: pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=false, silent=true, context.owner=method main
            typed new <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]: <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]
            adapted new <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String]: <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String] to ?, 
        typed new <empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[lang.this.String].<init>: (<param> v: A$sp, <param> w: scala.this.Int)<empty>.this.C2$mcLI$sp[A$sp]
{code}

I'm still trying to understand how this all works, so I don't have any futher insight. But up to this point the trees seem identical (AFAIK) so I assume that some internal state somewhere else is what is different.
I trust you saw what I checked in with the fix for 5488 in 1e648c3862

This is enough to bring it out:

./a.scala:30: error: type mismatch;

            ^

Well, that makes me feel slightly less bad about my println-based debugging strategy.

I'm not sure this qualifies as a break though, but I am now seeing *something* that explains what's going on. Basically, asSeenFrom uses the AsSeenFromMap whose apply() methods calls itself recursively for awhile until it finds something it can return.

The problem is that for C2 if you follow the chain of calls down you end up finding a TypeRef(prefix, sym, args) whose sym is actually C2$mcLZ$sp.A$sp (notice the Z not the I). Here's the debugging output:

{code}
TypeRef prefix=<noprefix> sym=type A$sp/C2$mcLZ$sp.A$sp args=List()
{code}

This is the problem... it's somehow got ahold of the wrong A$sp so from there on down things explode. That's probably why it works for @spec(Int, AnyRef)... in those cases it doesn't find the "wrong" class' A$sp type param.

I don't know where this gets us, but it's something.
OK, I'm pretty sure the issue is that makeSpecializedMembers/specName is linking the type params to the wrong class. For example:

{code}
[log explicitouter] creating tree for C2$mcLV$sp.<init>
[log explicitouter] specName(value v) env: Map(type A -> A$sp, type B -> scala.this.Unit) tvars: Set(type A)
[log explicitouter] specName #2 Map(C2.A -> C2$mcLZ$sp.A$sp, C2.B -> scala.Unit)
[log explicitouter] specName(value w) env: Map(type A -> A$sp, type B -> scala.this.Unit) tvars: Set(type B)
[log explicitouter] specName #2 Map(C2.A -> C2$mcLZ$sp.A$sp, C2.B -> scala.Unit)
{code}

(I added the "specName #2" log line which maps the value TypeRef into its symbol's fullName)

Notice that we're interested in C2$mcLV$sp but we're getting an A$sp owned by C2$mcLZ$sp (Z instead of V).

OK... now all we need to do is figure out what needs to be fixed to make specName return the right thing (which might include passing it more context).
"Side-note: I need to learn to do this faster, 1 bug in 13 hours is pretty bad."

At 13 hours, you're so far ahead of the curve it's not even funny.

The reason those A$sp are owned by the wrong class is that they're not being cloned in produceTypeParameters.  It looks like it is operating under the belief that it can avoid cloning them more frequently than it actually can.  I think the cloning part should look more like this (after renaming variables to be less opaque.)
{code}
    val clonedParams = tparams map (tparam =>
      env get tparam filter (_.typeSymbol.owner == newOwner) match {
        case Some(tp) => tp.typeSymbol
        case _        => tparam cloneSymbol newOwner
      }
    )
{code}
Of course, it shouldn't look like that either, because there is WAY TOO MUCH low-level cloning and most of it is done wrong in one way or another, which is one reason why NSDNHO is not a meaningless string of letters to us like it ought to be.

There's still plenty of bug to be had around here even if that cache change works out.  Stay with it, it's very exciting to have anyone else actively working on stuff like this.

I find it useful, and pretty straightforward. Maybe it can trim an hour or two from your efforts. Here's a guide I prepared: Debugging Scalac in five minutes flat:

https://gist.github.com/863884

You can do something similar with an IntelliJ project based on the checked-out sources of scala; in that case I tend to add {{-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005}} to JAVA_OPTS before running {{scalac}}, then connect to it with a Remote Debug configuration.

http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/run-debug-configuration-remote.html

Of course the biggest time saver is to whittle down a five line reproduction before diving into the compiler internals, but I think you've already internalized this life skill.
Most of the maps created via perRunCaches are not performance optimizations, they are necessary for correctness.  They're typically of the form "I need to find this thing later and do one more thing to it after some other thing has happened." The "per-run" aspect is to protect the resident compiler from leaks they may/do contain.
