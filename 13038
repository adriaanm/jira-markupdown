I am using Eclipse with the plugin 2.4.3 core and Compiler plugin 2.6.9.RC412860.

When overriding a constructor, I didn't call another constructor as the first statement. I get two messages not very indicative of the issue:

Severity and Description	Path	Resource	Location	Creation Time	Id
'(' expected but ';' found.	DownstreamScala/src/downstream	TimePeriod.scala	line 11	1200900796501	55
'this' expected but 'val' found.	DownstreamScala/src/downstream	TimePeriod.scala	line 10	1200900796501	56

package downstream;
import java.util.Date

class TimePeriod(start: Date, end: Date) {
  def startDate = start
  def endDate = end
  
  def this(timePeriod: TimePeriod) = this(timePeriod.startDate, timePeriod.endDate)
  def this(OffFor: long) =
  {
        val someTime = 1000
        this(new Date(), new Date())
  }
}

When I comment out the "val someTime = 1000" line, the errors go away, which is normal.
