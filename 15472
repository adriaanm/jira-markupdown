{code}
object Test extends Application {
  class A
  class B extends A
  def foo(x: A, y: B) = print(1)
  object foo {
    def apply(x: B, y: B) = print(3)
    //def apply(x: A, y: A) = print(5)
  }

  foo(new B, new B)
}
{code}
This code is ok. There is no bug. It prints 3.
But if we uncomment second apply then it doesn't compile. What is strange, because we have most specific method.
