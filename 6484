Well, I sat on this for months because I wasn't real excited about it, and finally I asked adriaan to make a determination and he said go with it, although it wasn't the most ringing endorsement either.  But mostly, neither of us can afford to engage with peripheral library issues right now.  If you want to send another pull request that'd be great.
