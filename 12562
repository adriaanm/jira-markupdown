Yeah, it's unfortunate but you need a case-sensitive file-system for that.
I have (perhaps wrongly) defined the following:
```scala
     trait JunitMatchers
     object junitMatchers extends JunitMatchers
```
My guess is that with a case-insensitive file-system scala will overwrite (without telling you) the classes...
So if you're on a mac you can solve that by creating a case-sensitive partition.
