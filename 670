immutable.Map and immutable.Set are also interfaces, however, Map.apply and Set.apply exist.

Use case:

{code}
val colors = Seq("red", "green", "blue")
{code}

should declare variable of type Seq[String]. Without Seq.apply to variable I should write:

{code}
val colors: Seq[String] = List("red", "green", "blue")
{code}

8 more characters.
