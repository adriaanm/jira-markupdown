immutable.Map and immutable.Set are also interfaces, however, Map.apply and Set.apply exist.

Use case:
```scala
val colors = Seq("red", "green", "blue")
```

should declare variable of type Seq[String]. Without Seq.apply to variable I should write:
```scala
val colors: Seq[String] = List("red", "green", "blue")
```
