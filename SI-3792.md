The following session demonstrates the problem:

{code}
scala> type Hui = Nil.type
defined type alias Hui

scala> val n: Hui = Nil     
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : n.type (with underlying type Hui)
 required: Hui
       val n: Hui = Nil
           ^
{code}

However if I don't use type alias, it works no problem:

{code}
scala> val n:Nil.type = Nil
n: scala.collection.immutable.Nil.type = List()
{code}
(In r23065) closes SI-3792: type equality for singleton types did not take type aliases into account while chasing the chain of underlying types (if the underlying type is an alias of a singleton type, it should be followed)
