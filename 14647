When importing overloaded functions from two different objects, the compiler generates error when trying to use a function which has the same name regardless of the argument type.

Example:
```scala
object DoubleMath {
    def sin(x: Double) = 1
}

object FloatMath {
    def sin(x: String) = 1
}

class A {
    def test() {
        import DoubleMath._
        import FloatMath._

        println(sin(1.0) + sin("1"))
    }
}
```

Tested on 2.7.7.final and 2.7.3.final with the same result.
```scala
error: reference to sin is ambiguous;
it is imported twice in the same scope by
import FloatMath._
and import DoubleMath._
        println(sin(1.0) + sin("1"))
```

It would be very helpful to import overloaded functions from different objects to enable splitting large libraries into separate files and possibly shipping them in separate jars.

An example of using mass import is when doing mathematics, as you can import all the trigonometric and other standard functions with one statement.
