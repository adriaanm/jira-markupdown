The actors migration guide was based on the 'MigrationSystem' object from Akka. This object has been removed from Akka and this renders the Actor Migration Kit useless. 

The following things need to be changed:
  - MigrationSystem needs to be removed from Scala
  - Replacement from Akka needs to be added to scala
  - All test cases starting with "actmig" need to be modified to use the replacement
  - All the examples in the actor migration guide need to be modified to the new abstraction
  - There needs to be a paragraph about how to configure Akka actor systems to work after the migration
