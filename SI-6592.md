I've 2 files that have only one difference - "\r\n" sequence in the test.txt
[vladimir@vladimir tmp]$ cat test.txt
line1
line2
line3
[vladimir@vladimir tmp]$ cat test2.txt
line1
line2
line3[vladimir@vladimir tmp]$

I try to execute in the REPL:

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/test.txt").mkString(",")
res17: String = 
,l,i,n,e,1,
,l,i,n,e,2,
,l,i,n,e,3,
"

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/test2.txt").mkString(",")
res18: String = 
,,i,n,e,1,
,l,i,n,e,2,
,l,i,n,e,3

scala> 

As you can see, for test2.txt file the first "l" character ommited. I think, that it isn't expected behaviour.
If I run the following code from an IDE, not from REPL:

```scala
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println(scala.io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/test.txt").mkString(","))
    println(scala.io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/test2.txt").mkString(","))
  }
}
```

then I receive the following output:
```
,
,
,l,i,n,e,3
,
,
,
```
This is as expected, or to be expected, or, as the doctors say, as well as could be expected.

The "\r," sequence places a comma in the first column of the terminal.

The difference between the two strings is that one ends in whitespace, so REPL displays it in quotes; the open quote is overstruck instead of the first char of text.
```scala
scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("test2.txt").mkString(",") map { case '\r' => '*' case c => c }
res0: String =
l,i,n,e,1,*,
,l,i,n,e,2,*,
,l,i,n,e,3

scala> "a b c"
res1: String = a b c

scala> "a b c "
res2: String = "a b c "
```
