This may be due to the fact that the `toArray` method also comes with type parameters which have the element type `A` as the lower bound. This type parameter also needs to be inferred. If you wrote:
```scala
val f = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]()
f.toArray[String].map { x => x + "c" }
```

The type for `x` gets assigned.
