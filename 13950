As explained on ticket scala/bug#1387, the fact that the hashCode for tuples and case classes depends on the VM (they use getClass().hashCode()) means that the serialization and deserialization of immutable.HashSet (and probably other hash-based collections, but I have not verified) breaks.

Although I think it's worth fixing tuples and case classes, this issue is about changing hash-based collections so that serialization and deserialization work correctly even if the hashCode relies on some VM-specific computation.

The easiest way to do that is similar to how java.util.HashMap does it by serialising the objects into an array and then inserting them one by one into the Map on deserialisation. This means that the hashCodes are recomputed on deserialisation so there are no issues anymore.
