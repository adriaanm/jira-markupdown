Please consider adding support for at least @link, @literal and @code.

The complete list of javadoc tags can be found [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#javadoctags here].

BTW I've never used the @value tag when coding in Java, but it seems like a nice tag for documenting Scala vals.
Will this get implemented before the 2.8 release?
