in both 2.11.8 and 2.12.0, the IllegalAccessError mentioned by Adriaan no longer occurs. (You correctly get a "object MyClassBase cannot be accessed in package <empty>" compile-time error, because MyClassBase isn't declared public.)

As for the original issue, I suggest we simply close it as "Not a Bug". Scala simply doesn't have the Java concept of statics. We have companion objects instead, but no inheritance relationship exists between the companion objects of a subclass and a superclass. Following Java here and allowing {{MyClass.myStaticBaseMethod}} wouldn't be consistent with that.

You can call the method through the superclass, so I don't see that any actual interop problem arises here.
