I hope the comments inside the snippet explains the problem, if not please ask.

{code}
trait Foo
{
  val number : Int
  def print = println("Foo: " + number)
  override def toString = "Foo: " + number
}

trait Baz extends Foo
{
  override def print = println("Baz: " + (number-111))
  override def toString = "Baz: " + number
}


def id[A](foo : A) = foo
def convert(foo : Foo) = new Foo with Baz
{
  val number = foo.number
}


def test[D <% Foo](foo : D)
{
  // here the conversion is done because type erasure traits D as Any which does not define 'print'
  foo.print
  // no conversion is done here because Any already defines toString
  // however Foo overrides it, which a conversion should be done IMO
  println(foo.toString)
}

object Bar extends Foo
{	
  val number = 777
}
println("Id")
test(Bar)(id)

println()

println("Converted")
test(Bar)(convert)
{code}


P.S. One motivation behind this would be extend the 'Ordered' trait with {{ override def equals(a : Any) = .. }} because a.compare(b) == 0 can be different from a == b otherwise. As a consequence !(a < b || a > b) may be different from (a == b).
