My interpretation of the word is to "round up and exterminate." I'd code it in a hybrid functional/imperative manner:
```scala
def cull[A](as: Seq[A], cond: A => Boolean, action: A => Unit): Seq[A] =
  val (theUnlucky, theLucky) = as partition cond
  theUnlucky foreach action
  theLucky
}
```

Stay tuned for an easier-to-contribute-to incarnation of scala-swing post 2.10.0.
