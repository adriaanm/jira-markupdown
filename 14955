In the past few months I have sometimes wanted a "{{takeTo}}" method, which would take all elements up to and including the first for which a predicate was true. Or, in other words, the following equivalency would be true:
```scala
collection.takeTo(p) == collection.takeWhile(!p).init
```

I haven't found easy way to simulate such method using the existing ones. I have either used `sliding`, with the inconvenients it presents, or simply went about my code in a completely different manner.

So I ask for this method to be added. The name I propose is based on the `until`/`to` distinction used for ranges.
