Scala Version: 2.8.0.r19664-b20091116020221
(In r23383) A double goodness whammy involving type inference at the borders.

1) Implicit search preserves singleton type fidelity.
2) Unification of parent bounds is (closer to) correct.

Result of 1: "implicit def f(x: Foo.type)" will convert object Foo.
Result of 2: "new Trait[Int] { }" may enjoy its type constructor being
inferred, no longer foiled by the anonymous class.

Also included are some clarity-enhnancing renamings and refactorings.
Performance note: I heavily benchmarked the change to isSubArgs and it
is reproducibly faster than the previous implementation.  Numbers
and methodology available upon request.

Closes SI-2693, SI-3964.  Review by moors, who wrote most of this patch
but might like to review the comments.
Thanks guys, this should reduce the boilerplate needed to declare type class instances. 

While you're in a type unifying frenzy, I'll submit my Christmas wishlist: http://gist.github.com/650709 (Basically SI-2712, with the concession that the inference could be given a helping hand by the type of the implicit args)
