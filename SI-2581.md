Suppose that we have a class *A* and it is used in other classes. If we delete the *A* class no errors appear for the classes that are using it. This happens even if *A* and the classes that use it are in the same file. Please note that the *A.class* file gets deleted correctly from the filesystem.

I am using eclipse 3.5.1 and sdt 2.8.0.r19367-b20091102034447

**Steps to reproduce the bug**

 1. Create a class {{ class A }}
 2. Create a class {{ class B(val a: A) }}
 3. Delete class A
 4. No error are marked in the editor or the problems view
 5. Do a clean & build
 6. Now the editor and problems view contain the compilation error
I am afraid this does not appear to be fixed in r19510. I am using Eclipse 3.5.1 and SDT 2.8.0.r19510-b20091111030918 and the test scenario that I've provided in the test report reproduces the bug even if classes *A* and *B* are in the same Scala file.
BTW the test scenario that harrah provided in #2590 works as expected in r19510, but the problem here is not that class *B* will not get recompiled when we add *A* back.

The problem in this bug is that if we have classes A and B (even in the same file) and B uses A, if we delete A and recompile (by saving the file in Eclipse) we don't see any errors in B (although the *A.class* file gets deleted from the filesystem).

As I've written in a previous comment this happen for types (class/object/trait) and not for methods (def/val/var). 
r19515 contains the fix necessary to make it to work in the build manager (i.e. it identifies the files necessary to compile). However the second bit necessary to close this ticket is a duplicate of #2443. In resident mode symbols of top level classes don't get removed which is why you get this weird behaviour even if A and B are in the same file.
This bug appears to be fixed in r20397.

**Testing procedure**
 1. Create a class  class A
 2. Create a class class B(val a: A)
 3. Delete class A

After step 3 the expected error message appears in the Problems View.
