It is impossible to set debug break points in private methods of objects. In the following example, I can set a break point in the method debuggingPossible, but Eclipse won't let me set one in debuggingImpossible.

I'm using the Scala Eclipse Plugin in version 2.8.0.r21325-b20100404033944 on Eclipse version 3.5.2 on a Windows 7 64bit system. Eclipse is running with a 32 bit JRE version 1.6.0_19.
```scala
package test
object DebugTest {
  private def debuggingImpossible {
    "..."
  }
  def debuggingPossible {
    "..."
  }
}
```
