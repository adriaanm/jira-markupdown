I tried the same with the official Scala 2.10.2 last evening.  Today tried with 2.11.0-M4.  The bug appears to have happened in 2011 and then recently.
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-M4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_51).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import java.util._
import java.util._

scala> val d = new Date
d: java.util.Date = Mon Sep 09 11:48:01 PDT 2013

scala> val i = 0
i: Int = 0

scala> i += 1
<console>:12: error: value += is not a member of Int
              i += 1
                ^

scala> val j: Integer = 0
j: Integer = 0

scala> j += 1
<console>:12: error: value += is not a member of Integer
              j += 1

To me this simple increment of a counter is used everyday by programs to keep track of the inventory and should be fixed ASAP.
At least JIRA has labels for any future crippling bugs in the increment and decrement subsystems.
