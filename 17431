See Friday morning (2012-09-07), Scala IDE fails with a compilation error when build against Scala 2.10 nightly. The same code can successfully be build with the previous build (2012-09-06).

The errors are in [ScalaPresentationCompiler, line 151|https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/master/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/scala/tools/eclipse/ScalaPresentationCompiler.scala#L151]:

I was unable to reduce the test case. Simple tests with the same code structure work fine.

The problem is not from the usage of the {{case .. @ .. =>}} pattern. I rewrote the code without it, and it failed the same way.
