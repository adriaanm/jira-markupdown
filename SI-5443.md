Using the -i option to preload a file in the REPL appears to hang its startup.  The following terminal session says it all:

daniel@edi ~ λ cat > /tmp/test.scala
println("hello!")
val test = 42
<ctrl-d>
daniel@edi ~ λ scala -i /tmp/test.scala
Loading /tmp/test.scala...
<crickets sing...>
<ctrl-c>
daniel@edi ~ λ

It doesn't seem to matter what the contents of the file happen to be.  Even an empty file is sufficient to reproduce this behavior.  This happens for me both with 2.9.1.final, and a (slightly outdated) build of 2.10 from master.  Exact environment details given in the ticket attributes.
Duplicate of #4945.  Wasn't able to find the issue via Google, but Kenji Yoshida found it for me on Twitter.
