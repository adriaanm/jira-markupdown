<ins>What went wrong</ins>
The test code compiled and ran without issues 
```
scalac ./test.scala && scala -cp . Test 
```
but when loaded via the REPL ":load test.scala" it would bark: 
{quote}scala> :load test.scala
Loading test.scala...
defined trait A
defined class B
defined trait C
<console>:13: error: illegal inheritance;
 self-type B with C does not conform to B's selftype B with C
           val b  = new B with C
                        ^{quote}

<ins>What it should have been</ins>
Expecting the test code to compile and run from command line, REPL

<ins>Work around</ins>
Copy pasting the contents of test code into REPL works
A usability bug is still a bug.  Or I guess this would be a confusability bug.

This isn't an option setting: there are two distinct modes, normal and paste.  "load" is straightforward but ambiguous, since load could mean read but don't run.  "run" is more obvious in that regard, or "script" qua script.  Maybe "paste" is also not the right word. "block" insert. "here".  "run << EOF" etc.
