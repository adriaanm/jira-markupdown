=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
scala> case object N             
defined module N

scala> val x = N.getClass.getName
x: java.lang.String = N$$

scala> val y = (x, x.length)     
y: (java.lang.String, Int) = (N$$,23)
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

(N$$,2)

=== What do you see instead? ===

(N$$,23)

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

Similar problem with getSimpleName.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1-final
  - Java: 1.6.0_23
  - Operating system: Linux ia64
There are many differences between the repl and scalac.
This one like most others is not a bug.
```scala
scala> println(N.getClass.getName)
line0$$object$$$$iw$$$$iw$$N$$
```
