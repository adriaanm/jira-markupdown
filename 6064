Please respond to what I said about boxing/unboxing. If you feel that "implements X" wasn't intended exclusively for Unit, the auto-boxing/unboxing still should be in the spec.
```
The test x .asInstanceOf[T ] is treated specially if T is a numeric value type
(ยง12.2). In this case the cast will be translated to an application of a conversion
method x.toT (ยง12.2.1). For non-numeric values x the operation will raise a
ClassCastException.
```
```scala
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val o: AnyRef = ().asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
    o.asInstanceOf[Unit] //should be a ClassCastException                       
    println("no problems")
  }
}
```

There is no toUnit, as this won't compile:
```scala
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val o: AnyRef = ().asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
    o.toUnit
  }
}
```

I can open a separate ticket if you'd like.
