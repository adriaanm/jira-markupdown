The Scala 2.9 REPL evaluates each line in its own thread.

This violates the principle of least astonishment, but more importantly, it makes the REPL unusable with the many libraries that rely on thread-local contexts.

For instance, many ORMs use thread-locals for session management. One cannot meaningfully use these ORMs from the REPL as a result.
-Yrepl-sync in 2.9.1 disables thread creation.

This just puzzled me, too:

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.2 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.7.0_05).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val tl = new ThreadLocal[Int]
tl: java.lang.ThreadLocal[Int] = java.lang.ThreadLocal@3571fd

scala> tl.set(1)

scala> tl.get
res1: Int = 0
