Hello,
Is there reason why this will fail when I add a greater sign within the quoted string on the command line?

```scala
D:\>scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.7.3.final -- Copyright 2002-2009, LAMP/EPFL

D:\>scala -e "println(\"a-b\")"
a-b

D:\>scala -e "println(\"a->b\")"
The system cannot find the path specified.
```

I am using WindowsXP prof edit.
Thanks.
Hum... it looks like just a Windows things. I ran with any command with that argument it resulted the same:

```scala
D:\>blah -e "println(\"a->b\")"
The system cannot find the path specified.
```

I can get around my arrow output by doing this lengthy string:
```scala
D:\>scala -e "println(\"a-\" + '>' + \"b\")"
a->b
```

If anyone has better solution, please give advice, otherwise I guess this won't consider as Scala script bug, and you may close this ticket.

Thanks.
