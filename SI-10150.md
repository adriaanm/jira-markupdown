Compiling

```scala
class Arr[T](private val underlying: scala.Array[T]) extends AnyVal

trait SeqMonoTransforms[+A, +Repr] extends Any {
  protected[this] def fromIterableWithSameElemType(): Repr
}

class ArrOps[A](val xs: Arr[A]) extends AnyRef with SeqMonoTransforms[A, Arr[A]] {
  def fromIterableWithSameElemType(): Arr[A] = xs
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) =
    println(new ArrOps(new Arr(Array(1, 2, 3))).fromIterableWithSameElemType)
}
```

we get:

```scala
iarray.scala:10: error: bridge generated for member method fromIterableWithSameElemType: ()Arr[A] in class ArrOps
which overrides method fromIterableWithSameElemType: ()Repr in trait SeqMonoTransforms
clashes with definition of the member itself;
both have erased type ()Object
  def fromIterableWithSameElemType(): Arr[A] = xs
      ^
```
The error makes no sense. No bridge should have been generated, as the erasures of both `fromIterableWithSameElemType` methods  have the same type `()Object`

This is a blocker for any attempt to add immutable arrays to the collection strawman.
