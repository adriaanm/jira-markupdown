-Xstrict-inference might be a good place for this one if its too risky for broader release.

Just as a reminder, we also need to fix the regression noted in SI-5900/SI-7886 before 2.11.0-RC1. That might involve rolling back the changes of SI-7886 (unsound pattern inference). That patch actually only superfically improved the state of play.

These sort of unresolved questions suggests to me that the schedule for RC1 isn't realistic and that we need another month or so.
