The Scala interpreter could be substantially improved for users unfamiliar with scala or third-party libraries, by adding tab completion for variables, methods, and :load filenames. Ruby's irb does this, for example, and it makes the REPL incredibly more helpful for prototyping.
Scala 2.11.8 includes vastly improved tab completion. There is still room for improvement, e.g. I don't think {{:load}} completes filenames, but regardless, closing the ticket. PRs with further improvements very welcome.
