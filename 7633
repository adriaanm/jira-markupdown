Not re-opening until I can prove this ;)

Is local at /local?  In that case, I believe the symlink's leading ..'s will go back to / so it'll continue to work.  With your current test of the scala symlink, can you cd somewhere deeper and try it, say /usr/share/doc, where ../.. doesn't take you to /.
