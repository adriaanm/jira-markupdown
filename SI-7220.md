{{scala.util.Exception.Catch}} is obviously a functor, but it's missing the corresponding {{map}} implementation:

{code}
def map[S](f: T => S): Catch[S] =
  new Catch(this.pf andThen f, this.fin, this.rethrow);
{code}

This is useful when we want to keep the logic (exception handling/finalizers) but we need a different result value.
