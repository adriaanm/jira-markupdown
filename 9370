Things you might want to try (I can only guess; I'm not an android developer and none of this looks reproducible without time far beyond what I have.)

1) (new SQLHelperDemo(this).getReadableDatabase: SQLiteDatabase).close()

I don't expect this to help, but maybe it infers a weaker type in the chained expression. A stronger version would be { val x: SQLiteDatabase = new SQLHelperDemo(this).getReadableDatabase ; x.close() }

2) scalac -target:jvm-1.5-fjbg. We switched from fjbg to asm between 2.9 and 2.10; I don't think this is asm's doing, but not sure of that either.
