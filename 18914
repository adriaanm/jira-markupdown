Due to tree re-use under the hood type quasiquotes might match term trees:
{code}
scala> val tq"$a.$b" = q"Foo.bar"
a: universe.Tree = Foo
b: universe.Name = bar
{code}
This is quite unfortunate and looks like leakage of trees internals on the outside. I'd expect that pattern to only match selections of type members and always extract TypeName as a consequence.
