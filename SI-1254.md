Now that generics are visible to Java it seems that scala.Nothing causes some troubles:

```scala
// Fails: javac -cp scala-library-2.7.2.RC1.jar <file>
// incompatible types
// found   : scala.None$$
// required: scala.Option<Foo>
class NothingBug1 {
    public NothingBug1() {
	scala.Option<Foo> o = scala.None$$.MODULE$$;
    }
}

// Fails: javac -cp scala-library-2.7.2.RC1.jar <file>
// cannot access scala.Nothing
// class file for scala.Nothing not found
class NothingBug2 {
    public NothingBug2() {
	scala.Option<? extends Foo> o = scala.None$$.MODULE$$;
    }
}

// This compiles with javac but fails with Eclipse java compiler:
// 'The type scala.Nothing cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files'
class NothingBug3 {
    public NothingBug3() {
	scala.Option<?> o = scala.None$$.MODULE$$;
    }
}

// This compiles with javac but fails with Eclipse java compiler:
// 'The type scala.Nothing cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files'
class NothingBug4 {
    public NothingBug4() {
	scala.Option o = scala.None$$.MODULE$$;
    }
}

class Foo {
}
```
There are two separate issues at play:
- type `Nothing`, which has no Java equivalent. All Scala types involving `Nothing` will be awkward or unusable from Java.
- generic signatures for forwarders (static methods added to companion classes of top level objects) may contain unbound type variables (defined in super classes).

The second issue is more pressing, since it is plainly a bug. I opened another ticket, #1822, and link back to this ticket, to be revisited when #1822 is fixed.
Also, there is more info on a related issue at #1555.
Thanks for the pointer. I think #1555 is a specific instance of #1822.
