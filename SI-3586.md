Currently that syntax is restricted to work for foo being a StableIds only.

However, it seems possible to extend it to foo being an arbitrary expression.

That means that whenever the compiler finds the expression "bar" and cannot resolve it, it would then try "foo.bar".

Basically the following:
{code}
import (expression)._

def whatever = foo
{code}

would be equivalent to:
{code}
def import_expression$$ = expression

def whatever = import_expression$$.foo
{code}


A similar effect could be obtained by adding parameterless implicit conversions:
{code}
implicit def import_expression() = expression

def whatever = foo
{code}

This would be itself importable, which may or may not be a good thing.

Sample usage is for "proxy classes" where the proxy object is determined by a method call instead of being a val.

Obviously this should also work where members are explicitly specified/renamed instead of using _
