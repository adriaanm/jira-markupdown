Returning null from a function that returns a generic array fails in ScalaRunTime$$.boxArray.

Test case to reproduce (verified on 2.7.4):

```scala

class BoxTest[V <: Object](theFunc: String => Array[V]) {
  def getTheValue(name: String) =
    theFunc(name)(0);
}

object main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val bt = new BoxTest(h => null);
    println(bt.getTheValue("Hi there."));
  }
}

```
Here is a faster way to get the same error:
```scala
scala> (null: Array[Any])(0)
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at .<init>(<console>:5)
```
I can only suppose you think this is doing something other than what it's doing.
I don't get a NullPointerException, I get a MatchError.

The (0) is unnecessary; I should have removed it. My apologies! Let me clarify the code:

```scala

class BoxTest[V <: Object](theFunc: String => Array[V]) {
  def getTheValue(name: String) =
    theFunc(name);
}

object main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val bt = new BoxTest(h => null);
    println(bt.getTheValue("Hi there."));
  }
}

```
Ah.  In that case you'll be happy to hear it's fixed in trunk.
```scala
$$ scala main
null
```
