This is the one where the call to stringFormat in object Foo induces implicit search (augmentString and a TypeTag), which causes the imported symbols to be checked. Conversely to my previous comment,
```scala
import JsonProtocol.{ stringFormat, barFormat, bazFormat } 
```
suffices to break it. barFormat uses stringFormat, baz uses formatter for Foo, Bar.
