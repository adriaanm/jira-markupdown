I implemented this in r17806 (trunk) with some changes, though. The most important ones are:

  * I used the existing method names `newActor`, `terminated` and `onTerminate`, instead of
    adding the ones you proposed; they have the exact same meaning anyway.

  * I turned `ActorGC` into a trait, replacing `SchedulerGCSupport`.

  * I moved the logic to configure the thread pool using the `actors.corePoolSize` and
    `actors.maxPoolSize` Java properties into the separate `ThreadPoolConfig` object.
    Therefore, using the configuration won't result in initialising the `Scheduler` object.
