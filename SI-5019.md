When I pass a {{-Jfoo}} argument to the {{scala}} command, I would expect {{foo}} to be passed to the java command, and for {{-Jfoo}} to not be included in the list of arguments passed to my main function, as they are explicitly for the Java runtime and not my program. However, any {{-J}} arguments are included.

This behaviour is due to https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/templates/tool-unix.tmpl#L129.

The problem really is that when you run a command such as

{{scala -Jfoo Bar}}

the Java command that is finally run is

{{java ... scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner -Jfoo Bar}}

This means that {{scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner}} tries to run the class {{-Jfoo}} with the argument {{Bar}}, and obviously fails to find the class.

Also, {{-J}} isn't documented in the manual page. The related option {{-D}} is documented.

This is possibly related to SI-4907.
If you have witnessed it attempting to treat the -J argument like a class to run then you had better give me a transcript, because that's not what happens.  And if you read the source to the runner you will see why it passes it.

Using {{HelloWorld.scala}} from http://www.scala-lang.org/node/166.

{noformat}
$scala HelloWorld
Hello, world!
{noformat}

{noformat}
$scala -J-Xmx256M HelloWorld
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException 
 - klass: 'java/lang/ClassNotFoundException'
{noformat}

{noformat}
$scala HelloWorld -J-Xmx256M
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException 
 - klass: 'java/lang/ClassNotFoundException'
{noformat}

I presume that the ClassNotFoundException is {{-J-Xmx256M}}, but actually I may be mistaken about that.

I am using {{JAVA_OPTS}} as a workaround.

Edit: I meant HelloWorld, not Test in command lines above.
As an aside, looking at {{scala -help}} I can see that the format is

{noformat}
scala <options> [<script|class|object|jar> <arguments>]
{noformat}

However, if I run

{noformat}
scala HelloWorld -J-help
{noformat}

Then the {{scala}} script is treating {{-J-help}} as an *option*, when according to the usage grammar, it should be treating it as an *argument* and shouldn't be doing anything with it apart from passing it to {{main}}, so there is definitely something not right with the script.
{noformat}
% cat a.scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }
}
% scalac291 a.scala 
% scala291 -J-Xmx256M HelloWorld
Hello, world!
{noformat}
You'll have to supply evidence it's not something in your environment.

There is a bug, which is that "scala HelloWorld -J-help" should be passing -J-help to HelloWorld rather than grabbing it for the JVM.

Can't reproduce with scala 2.11.4 on Mac OS X 10.10, and according to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4907 and https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2767 it looks like it was already fixed.
