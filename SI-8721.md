Since `java.math.BigDecimal` is not final, it would save an extra object instance if `scala.BigDecimal` extended `j.m.BD` instead of wrapping it. 

It would also make `s.BD` => `j.m.BD` conversion needless.

Same applies to BigInteger/BigInt

If that's the only problem, is that so bad?
@nilskp Yes, it is so bad.  It matters which BigDecimal you're using, and it will be easy to get even more confused than you already are (e.g. use external library and not realize you need to rewrap), and it's a maintenance headache to catch everything (e.g. if Java ever adds a method to BigDecimal we have to notice and add it also *and* re-implement that function for earlier versions of Java so we're compatible with more than just the latest).
