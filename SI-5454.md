Compiling the following,

{code}
object IllegalInheritance {
  trait A
  implicit def a = new A {}            // def => val
  //val r = implicitly[A]              // uncomment

  class B[T](t : T)(implicit a : A)    // remove implicit param block

  class C extends B/*[Int]*/(23)       // uncomment
  val c = new C                        // comment
}
{code}

with 2.9.1.final or 2.10.0-M1-0179-g34233f031e-2012-02-10 results in the following error reports,

{code}
bug.scala:8: error: could not find implicit value for parameter a: IllegalInheritance.A
  class C extends B/*[Int]*/(23)       // uncomment
          ^
bug.scala:8: error: illegal inheritance;
 self-type IllegalInheritance.C does not conform to IllegalInheritance.B[Int]'s selftype IllegalInheritance.B[Int]
  class C extends B/*[Int]*/(23)       // uncomment
                  ^
two errors found
{code}

Any one of the changes mentioned in the line-end comments will result in a successful compilation. Compiling with -Yno-self-type-checks eliminates the illegal inheritance error, but doesn't eliminate the spurious implicit resolution failure.

There is a big mess described in the comments of SI-3439 that is likely related to the weirdness you see here.
