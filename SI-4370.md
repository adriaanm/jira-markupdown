=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
Long.MinValue to Long.MaxValue by Int.MaxValue
{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
(2*9223372036854775807)/2147483647 = 8589934596
and 8589934596 > Int.MaxValue.

It should be rejected, because it has more than Int.MaxValue elements.

=== What do you see instead? ===
{code}
scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Long] = NumericRange(-9223372036854775808)
{code}

=== Additional information ===
I think Paul is the expert here, see SI-4308 and SI-4321.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24516-b20110320020044

It's not difficult.  Writing tests is by far the most useful thing you could do.  Just look at the existing tests.  Here are the ones which mention Range somehow.
{code}
% ./partest --grep Range

Hi Paul.

Some smaller additions to files/run/range.scala, new file is:

(Two of them (range1, range2) will fail currently.)
I may have a fix for "0.0 until 0.3 by 0.1".

I'm trying to fix https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8518. I've added a test for it, and have a fix. It also fixes "0.0 until 0.3 by 0.1". Perhaps someone can help me sort out the binary incompatibility warnings? The changes are in:
https://github.com/darabos/scala/commits/SI-8518

Should I send this as a pull request even if it is unfinished?
It doesn't exactly _rely_ on such changes, it's just me being clumsy. I've got a version now which only adds two new private methods. Still it is rejected by the forward binary compatibility check. I'm fairly new to all this — is there a common way to add some internal code in a way that passes the compatibility check?

I appreciate you jumping on the problem right away! It's just that SI-8518 was broken in 2.10 too, so even if you fix this tomorrow, I still have to figure it out for my change. Thanks!
The anchor point is meant to only solve SI-8518. In that case the problem is that we suffer from floating point inaccuracies each time we pick a new start and end point, so take() and drop() end up silly.

After struggling with binary compatibility a bit longer, I'm of the opinion as well to submit it against 2.12. But how do I do that? Is it on a separate branch, or do I tell test.bc somehow which version to test against?

Sorry for polluting your ticket. Let me know if I should take my questions elsewhere. Thanks!
My point is that once the floating point inaccuracies are fixed, SI-8518 will magically work also; and an anchor point is not really the best way to solve them anyway, since you still have inaccuracies in our output (you just cope with them internally).

I don't think the 2.12 branch has been created yet.  Just hang on until it is, I guess, and then rebase and submit against that branch.  But I think I'm going to have to fix the inaccuracy problem anyway.  I haven't quite figured out yet what is possible without breaking compatibility.
It still does defer to BigDecimal depending on how you construct it. I guess this is my doing via the de-duplication of the to/until code for numerics.
{code}
scala> 0.0 until 0.3 by 0.1
res5: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Double] = NumericRange(0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.30000000000000004)

scala> Range.Double(0.0, 0.3, 0.1)
res6: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Double] = NumericRange(0.0, 0.1, 0.2)
{code}
[~extempore] 'fraid so.  Patching it back in is nontrivial, because as usual there's an incomplete proxy involved that needs to be fixed as well--but in this case it may not be fixable without breaking binary compatibility in at least one direction.
Not sure I succeeded at preserving binary compatibility, but
