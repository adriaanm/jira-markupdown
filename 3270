I addressed this in r24308.  I didn't use the word "new" in the message, maybe I should.  The hint is pretty strong though.
```scala
      scala> scala.collection.mutable.MultiMap(1, 2, 3)
      <console>:8: error: object MultiMap is not a member of package scala.collection.mutable
      Note: trait MultiMap exists, but it has no companion object.
```
