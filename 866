stupid example, but just add this right after the _compute_ def in the example above:

{{implicit def compute2[A](a :A, b :A) = if (a. hashCode > b. hashCode) Some(a) else None}}

I'm not an implicit expert, so might be that the most concrete match (here Int) wins and there is no ambiguity. Depends on the exact language spec, which I don't remeber..
