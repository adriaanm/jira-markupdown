While translating some code from Ruby to Scala it occurred to me that Ruby's style of variable expansion could be statically applied to Scala code as a compilation step. The string


`"Hello, #{ username }!"`

can be replaced with

`"Hello, " + { username } + "!"`

where username must be a value in the current scope or compilation will fail. As in Ruby, the contents of the template don't have to refer to a single value, but rather a block that returns a value. 

The inline #{} method is more readable, I would argue, than printf style, and less cluttered/error-prone than concatenation. The more insertions the string requires, the greater the effect. In languages where variable expansion is possible, it tends to be the preferred method for building strings.

I built a prototype for this behavior in the scanner (to attach), it works against all the cases I've come up with. Although, I wouldn't know if the functionality would be more properly spread across different compilation steps. For me the simplest thing was to have the scanner return tokens for the operations described above so that later compilation steps can proceed exactly as normal.
There's a String interpolation plugin that seems much interesting, which I personally prefer to what's being proposed here.
