The workaround is to dissociate the skolem from the free term, e.g. by creating the info for the free term manually like this.

2.10.x:

{code}
-val tree = q"${reify(c).tree}"
+val csym = build.newFreeTerm("c", c)
+build.setTypeSignature(csym, typeOf[C[_]])
+val tree = q"$csym.i"
{code}

2.11.x:

{code}
-val tree = q"${reify(c).tree}"
+val csym = internal.reificationSupport.newFreeTerm("c", c)
+internal.reificationSupport.setInfo(csym, typeOf[C[_]])
+val tree = q"$csym.i"
{code}
