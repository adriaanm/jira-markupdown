(In r22767) Since r22186 scripts wait for all non-daemon threads to exit
before the script will exit (not doing so was the cause of several
other bugs involving early script termination) but this means we
must be careful not to introduce unnecessary non-daemon threads
in the script infrastructure.  Two such sources (now fixed) were
the shutdown hook which deletes temporary files and the stream
consumers used by Process.  Closes scala/bug#3678, review by harrah.
