Java classes that take type parameters are determined to take zero type parameters.

Tested that it works in:
* 2.7.5
* 2.8.0-20091008.004205-232

Output is:
error: java.util.List takes no type parameters, expected: one
to illustrate the complexity, what should we do in this case:
compile with scalac:
{code}
class Monad[X]
{code}

compile with javac:
{code}
public class EvilRaw {
  public Monad createMonad() {return null;}
}
{code}

then compile with scalac:
{code}
class GoodScala extends EvilRaw {
  override def createMonad: Monad[_] = error("foo")
}
{code}

this should compile, right? since raw types that occur in java sigs are converted to existential types
see also SI-2305 and SI-2266
Martin, I propose to fix this as follows, assuming this time I understood correctly when types without arguments are considered to be raw (briefly, when they are the type of a symbol that occurs in java code, not necessarily when they refer to a java symbol)
So, I think the original rawToExistential is wrong. 

add to Symbol:
{code}
+    /** Modify term symbol's type so that a raw type C is converted to an existential C[_]
+     *
+     * This is done in checkAccessible and overriding checks in refchecks
+     * We can't do this on class loading because it would result in infinite cycles.
+     */
+    private var triedCooking: Boolean = false
+    final def cookJavaRawInfo() {
+      require(isTerm)
+      // println("cookJavaRawInfo: "+(rawname, triedCooking))
+
+      if(triedCooking) return else triedCooking = true // only try once...
+
+      def cook(sym: Symbol) {
+        require(sym hasFlag JAVA)
+
+        object rawToExistentialInJava extends TypeMap {
+          def apply(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
+            // any symbol that occurs in a java sig, not just java symbols
+            // see http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/2454#comment:14
+            case TypeRef(pre, sym, List()) if !sym.typeParams.isEmpty =>
+              val eparams = typeParamsToExistentials(sym, sym.typeParams)
+              existentialAbstraction(eparams, TypeRef(pre, sym, eparams map (_.tpe)))
+            case _ =>
+              mapOver(tp)
+          }
+        }
+        val tpe1 = rawToExistentialInJava(sym.tpe)
+        // println("cooking: "+ sym +": "+ sym.tpe +" to "+ tpe1)
+        if (tpe1 ne sym.tpe) {
+          sym.setInfo(tpe1)
+        }
+      }
+
+      if (hasFlag(JAVA))
+        cook(this)
+      else if (hasFlag(OVERLOADED))
+        for (sym2 <- alternatives)
+          if (sym2 hasFlag JAVA)
+            cook(sym2)
+    }
{code}

in TypeRef, isHigherKinded is now again:
{code}
override def isHigherKinded = (args.isEmpty && !typeParamsDirect.isEmpty)
{code}

checkAccessible in Infer becomes:
{code}
...
         if (sym1 == NoSymbol) {
...
         } else {
+        if(sym1.isTerm)
+          sym1.cookJavaRawInfo() // xform java rawtypes into existentials
+
           var owntype = try{ 
             pre.memberType(sym1)
           } catch {
{code}

and checkOverride must also cook:
{code}
....
          } else if (other.isTerm) {
            other.cookJavaRawInfo() // SI-2454
...
{code}

I'm not sure if this is what you had in mind. Please advise and re-assign.
this works for now (will check fix in today), but we can't guarantee this will keep working due to the hairy interaction between the necessity of cooking raw java types to existentially quantified scala types (this only happens for types of symbols that are accessed or overridden) and simply treating these types as higher-kinded types

Note that this patch caused SI-2919.
