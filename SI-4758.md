The following code fails to compile:

```scala
trait M[F[_]]  
case class S[X[_] <: M[X], A](x:X[A])

error: constructor of type S[X,A] cannot be uniquely instantiated to expected type Any
 --- because ---
cyclic instantiation
       case class S[X[_] <: M[X], A](x:X[A])                ^
```

The issue is specific to case classes because the workaround below is accepted without any cyclic instantiation error:

```scala
trait M[F[_]]  
class S[X[_] <: M[X], A](val x:X[A])
  
object S {
  def apply[X[_] <: M[X], A](x:X[A]):S[X, A] = new S[X, A](x)
}
```
Looks like synthetic method creation not dealing correctly with higher kinded types, something that completely redlines the concept of unsurprising.

What do you think adriaan, you or me?
```scala
// works
trait M[F[_]]  
class S[X[_] <: M[X], A](val x:X[A])
object S {
  def apply[X[_] <: M[X], A](x: X[A]): S[X, A] = new S[X, A](x)
  def unapply[X[_] <: M[X], A](p: S[X, A]) = Some(p.x)  
}
// seemingly equivalent, doesn't work
trait M[F[_]]  
case class S[X[_] <: M[X], A](x: X[A])
```
