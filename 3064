It looks like arrays can only flatten other arrays, or things which can be implicitly converted to arrays (which isn't much of anything I think.) I am not sure why it operates on arrays and not traversables.  I suppose given the fact that you can't overload on the implicit parameter and that Arrays are no longer Traversables, it's an either/or decision unless some way is devised to say asSomething: A => Traversable[B] or Array[B]...
