I really want to make value discarding warnings fatal as I have hit many bugs in production because of it. Sadly, we have a few things we're using deprecated (I do not care about those, for the moment) - so when I run:

{noformat}
$ ./qbin/scala -Xfatal-warnings
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20140312-105634-9c38e86a55 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> @deprecated("Bad", "1.0") def addOne(x: Int) = { x + 1 }
addOne: (x: Int)Int

scala> addOne(2)
error: there were 1 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
{noformat}

I have not turned on the {{-deprecation}} flag, so I do not expect an error to occur. Can we make this be a warning until that flag is turned on?
[~retronym] as you know, I'm really interested in configurable warnings. Is there anything available to see what the plan is?
Adriaan is prototyping something here: https://github.com/adriaanm/scala/tree/report-filter

Another (SBT specific) angle would be to add a hook into:

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/blob/0.13/compile/interface/src/main/scala/xsbt/DelegatingReporter.scala

to filter to your hearts content.


I've added this extremely awful task to SBT:

{code}
def fatalWarningsTask = TaskKey[Unit]("fatalWarnings") <<= Def.task {
  fatalWarningsTaskImpl(streams.value, (compile in Compile).value)
}

def fatalWarningsTaskImpl(s: TaskStreams, a: sbt.inc.Analysis) {
  def logProblem(l: (=> String) => Unit, f: File, p: xsbti.Problem) = {
    l(f.toString + ":" + p.position.line.fold("")(_ + ":") + " " + p.message)
    l(p.position.lineContent)
    l("")
  }

  var failed = 0
  a.infos.allInfos.foreach { case (k, i) =>
    i.reportedProblems foreach { p =>
      val deprecation = p.message.contains("is deprecated")

      if(!deprecation)
        failed = failed + 1

      logProblem(if(deprecation) s.log.warn else s.log.error, k, p)
    }
  }

  if(failed > 0)
    error("Fatal warnings")
}
{code}

A total mess.
The traditional advice on deprecation warnings is to pipe it through a deprecated something that doesn't warn.  

Retronym has suggested deprecating a trait, implemented by its companion, and use the module method.

I have suggested deprecating a local function that forwards the call, to the same effect.

Edit: deprecated locals loophole was closed in 2.11.0-M8.

SI-7529 is very similar, just replacing {{-deprecation}} with {{-Yinline-warnings}}.
This PR respects explicit settings (which were new this year):
{code}
-deprecation:false -Yinline-warnings:false
{code}
