=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Try linking to anything other than a class with ScalaDoc.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Links should be able to point to classes, objects(!), methods.
Choosing the right method in case of overloading should be supported.

=== What do you see instead? ===
It doesn't work, there is neither a specification in case anyone plans to implement it.

=== Additional information ===
Having thought about this, afaiu we can't follow Java's path of using "." for static methods/fields and "#" for instance methods/fields because of path-dependant types.

A thinkable worst-case could be something like this:
```scala
package Foo

class Foo {
  class Bar
  def Bar = 0
}
```

```scala
package Foo.Bar

class Bar
object Bar
```
Now add package objects on top of that.

It would be possible to use things like `foo(Int,String)` for overload resolution of methods, comparable to Java.
See #3695 for a quick tutorial on using links to members.
