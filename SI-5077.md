In both the 2.9.1 and the current nightly API doc, methods like {{toString}} and {{##}} that have zero parameter lists are shown as having a single, empty parameter list. That's incorrect; these are distinct method types.

For example toString is shown as: {{def toString (): String}} when it should be simply {{def toString: String}}.

doh.

well, I'm tempted to suggest the empty parameter lists be removed from the synthetic methods. it seems like the right thing from the user's perspective. but I can easily imagine it wouldn't really be worth tinkering with.

I could put the patch to Any.scala and AnyRef.scala together if you like. I'm in there anyway, documenting.

(extempore in [r25836|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25836]) Donated some parens to Any.

And a touch of documentation correctness.  Closes SI-5077, no review.
