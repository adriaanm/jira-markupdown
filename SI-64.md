Java:

```scala
synchronized String g() { return "str"; }
```

gets compiled to

```scala
synchronized java.lang.String g();
  Signature: ()Ljava/lang/String;
  Code:
   0:   ldc     SI-2; //String str
   2:   areturn

}
```

Scala:

```scala
def f = synchronized { "str" }
```

gets compiled to

```scala
public java.lang.String f();
  Signature: ()Ljava/lang/String;
  Code:
   0:   aload_0
   1:   dup
   2:   astore_1
   3:   monitorenter
   4:   ldc     SI-14; //String str
   6:   aload_1
   7:   monitorexit
   8:   checkcast       SI-16; //class java/lang/String
   11:  areturn
   12:  aload_1
   13:  monitorexit
   14:  athrow
  Exception table:
   from   to  target type
     4     8    12   any
```

Although Java

```scala
String g() { synchronized (this) { return "str"; } }
```

is also compiled to something like Scala compiler outputs, I think Scalac should optimize special case

```scala
def f(args) = synchronized { ... }
```
I improved the dead-code elimination pass to take care of such cases, so compiling with `-optimise` should remove them. It's still not ideal, so I'll leave this ticket open. I think we should not even generate boxing for `synchronized` blocks.

I wonder what optimization you have made... or whether this was reverted at some point. I see no difference in the generated code with recent trunk than what was originally posted.
I participated anyway.  Here's what that def f generates in scala now.
```scala
  public synchronized java.lang.String f();
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_SYNCHRONIZED
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=1, args_size=1
         0: ldc           #12                 // String str
         2: areturn       
```
