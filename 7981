I love the minty fresh palette.

You bleat me to it [sic] but here's a version with some virtues. I'm especially happy with the Option example. (But the point, that your by-name param isn't evaluated during eta-expansion, isn't in the spec yet, I think.) Also happy with showing eval of other parts of the expr, since people are supposedly confused by what underscore encompasses.

You know the guy who annoys you by coming up to your car at a stop light with a dirty squeegee?  I hope I'm not that guy.
