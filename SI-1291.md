Currently the Scala compiler outputs an "illegal cyclic reference" error when a type projection references itself, even though the containing type is instantiated with different type parameters, see the code example below. This severely limits the possibilities for meta programming (as done in C++) in Scala, which is a shame because the language has the expressive power to make it work.

I see two solutions to this limitation:

- Remove the cyclic reference check and add a maximum type alias/projection depth similar to the template instantiation depth limit found in many C++ compilers (including GCC, -ftemplate-depth-n).

- Enhance the cyclic reference checker, for example if the path contains A[Int]#Type and A[Float]#Type it shouldn't be considered a cyclic reference.

{code}
object ProjTest {
  trait MInt { type Type[T <: MInt] }
  trait _0 extends MInt { type Type[T <: MInt] = Boolean }
  trait Succ[Pre <: MInt] extends MInt { type Type[T <: MInt] = T#Type[T] }
  
  type _1 = Succ[_0]
  type _2 = Succ[_1]
  
  type X1 = _0#Type[_0]  // Ok
  type X2 = _1#Type[_0]  // Ok
  type X3 = _2#Type[_2]  // Compiler error, illegal cyclic reference involving type Type
}
{code}

Sorry, the code is buggy. A correct example:
{code}
object ProjTest {
  trait MInt { type Type }
  trait _0 extends MInt { type Type = Boolean }
  trait Succ[Pre <: MInt] extends MInt { type Type = Pre#Type }
  
  type _1 = Succ[_0]
  type _2 = Succ[_1]
  
  type X1 = _0#Type   // Ok
  type X2 = _1#Type   // Ok
  type X3 = _2#Type   // Compiler error, illegal cyclic reference involving type Type
}
{code}
Which doesn't contain a loop and should be expanded to:
{code}
_2#Type = Succ[_1]#Type = _1#Type = Succ[_0]#Type = _0#Type = Boolean
{code}
Can you verify if this works with your experimental branch?

If it does, it could be hopefully be used to implement more advanced things like HList (see http://jnordenberg.blogspot.com).
