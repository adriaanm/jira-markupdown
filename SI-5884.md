I spent a good half a day trying to work out a VerifyError, which I eventually tracked back to this:
{code}
scala> def f[QVC: ClassTag] = typeTag[QVC]
f: [QVC](implicit evidence$1: ClassTag[QVC])TypeTag[QVC]

scala> f[List[Int]]
res0: TypeTag[List[Int]] = TypeTag[QVC]
{code}
I sure hope it's intended to act like this:
{code}

scala> def f[QVC: TypeTag] = classTag[QVC]
<console>:7: error: No ClassTag available for QVC
       def f[QVC: TypeTag] = classTag[QVC]
                                     ^
{code}

I see from reading "ErasureTag vs ClassTag and TypeTag vs ConcreteTypeTag" that this is expected.  I hope this behavior will be reconsidered.

"Your problem would have been solved if you used ConcreteTypeTags..."

Understand that I wasn't using anything.  I changed a method from using typetags to classtags - or so I thought.  (So I was trying NOT to use type tags.) The reason I use a typesafe language is so if I make a mistake like that, it will be caught by the compiler.  It doesn't help to give it a different name.

We have two things with similar, overlapping purposes, and if you put one where you mean the other, not only does everything still compile, but the manifestation of the problem is a million miles away.  Really, a VerifyError in the scala.reflect package object which silently freezes startup and which only happens under select circumstances is not how I want to find out about what should be a static typing error.

"Yep, this is by design, since you might want to reify a complex type that has a teeny-tiny reference to an unresolved type parameter. In that case this behaviour is useful."

Do we not see that the audience for reifying unresolved type parameters is such a small fraction of the audience for reifying the actual explicit type argument that it is lost in the noise.  To have a trap like this in place, in the default scope, on the basis that it's useful for that tiny audience... it is emblematic of the most common criticism of scala.

The question isn't whether they should exist, but what should happen by default when someone uses the obvious name.  A default which silently offers such dangerously different behavior between "def f[T] = typeTag[T]" and "def f[T: TypeTag] = typeTag[T]" is the kind of thing which would literally cause me to find another language.  And I'm a fan.  I hate to think how someone who was already conflicted might react.

If you leave it like this, just don't say later nobody saw it coming.

To properly appreciate this example, put a couple thousand lines of code and/or inheritance from elsewhere between the implicit definition of tag and the method.
{code}
scala> class Foo[T](implicit tag: TypeTag[T]) { def bippy = typeTag[T] }
defined class Foo

scala> (new Foo[List[Int]]).bippy
res0: TypeTag[List[Int]] = ConcreteTypeTag[List[Int]]

scala> class Foo2[T](implicit tag: TypeTag[T]) { def bippy = { val tag = "bippy" ; typeTag[T] } }
defined class Foo2

scala> (new Foo2[List[Int]]).bippy
res1: TypeTag[List[Int]] = TypeTag[T]
{code}

I should also point out that "AbsXXX" is used as a name in six other places in the reflection library.  In 6/6 it means "an abstract class which is extended by something else." Here you are using "Abs" for the concrete class in regards to what it represents rather than in reference to what it is.  It is a naming category error to mix them.

It isn't as if "Abs" is unambiguous, either.  One can easily imagine an "absolute type tag" for instance, in contrast to a "relative" one which requires a prefix.  An absent type tag, an absurd type tag... we have the means to alias long names.  AbsTypeTag is still too long for me if I care about the length at all, so I'd have to alias it anyway.  Why not let me alias from a name which doesn't require still more decoding.
