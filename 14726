```scala
object Test {
  class MyGraph[V <: Any] {
    def addVertex(v: V): Boolean = true
  }

  type DuckGraph = {
    def addVertex(vertex: Int): Boolean
  }
  
  def fail(graph: DuckGraph) = graph addVertex 1

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    fail(new MyGraph[Int])
  }
}
```
```scala
