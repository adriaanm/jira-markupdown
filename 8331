Specializing against `AnyRef` is not longer supported. It never really worked, and inflicted collateral damage.

But, specializing a subset of a method's type parameters should definitely work. I'm not that familiar with this area of the compiler, but I've put together a patch that seems to fix things:

I need to expand the test coverage and documentation before submitting a pull request.
