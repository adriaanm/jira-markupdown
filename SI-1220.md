The Stream object returned by cons evaluates its tail lazily, then caches the result in a member variable. Unfortunately, this evaluation can happen more than once if tail is called from multiple threads. If the tail function has state, then this can cause invalid results.

I think this behaviour should either be fixed - by synchronizing when evaluating/inspecting the tail - or documented somewhere. I've attached a script that demonstrates the problem and a rough solution.
It's not, though I've often wished for that capability. What I tend to do in that context is add an additional boolean parameter "thunked" or something like that, with:

{code}
var thunked = false;
lazy val foo = {thunked = true; fooCalc }
{code}

It would be nice if you could access the functionality to determine if the value had been thunked without needing to recreate it yourself though.

You're wasting a perfectly good bit there, bub!
{code}
scala> class Foo { lazy val bar = 5 }                                           defined class Foo

scala> val x = new Foo                        
x: Foo = Foo@c7f3e3

scala> val f = x.getClass.getField("bitmap$$0")
f: java.lang.reflect.Field = public volatile int Foo.bitmap$$0

scala> def isEvaluated = (f.getInt(x) & 1) != 0
isEvaluated: Boolean

scala> isEvaluated
res0: Boolean = false

scala> x.bar
res2: Int = 5

scala> isEvaluated
res3: Boolean = true
{code}
Which is not to say this approach doesn't have a certain fragility and oh so slight implementation dependence... but I see no reason there couldn't be an interface to the data.
See also SI-3515 for a little more recent discussion.
Since there's work going on with Stream at the moment anyway, might this be a good time to fix this on trunk (even if it doesn't make it into 2.8.0)?

I've appended a patch with a proposed solution (passes {{ant test}} on top of current r22157).

It replaces Stream.Cons by

{code}
  @serializable @SerialVersionUID(2734764611255889683L)
  final class Cons[+A](hd: A, tl: => Stream[A]) extends Stream[A] {
    override def isEmpty = false
    override val head = hd
    def tailDefined = tailDefinedVar
    @volatile private var tailDefinedVar = false
    override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = {
      tailDefinedVar = true
      tl
    }
  }
{code}

I regenerated the serial version UID, since this will be incompatible with the old one, right?
(In r22897) Closes SI-1220. Stream.tail is now thread safe. Review by odersky.
