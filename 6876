Gasp, it looks like I just broke this a week ago in r25984.  I'm sad that my equality sanity checks don't catch that nonsensical eq test, and I know why too.  In any case that's obviously supposed to be comparing pre and pre0.  The optimization in question is that it is created a TypeRef directly (capital TypeRef) rather than going through the factory (lower case typeRef) because the former mechanism bypasses the unique type cache.
