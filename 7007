Funny, I've been working on this pretty much exactly in my attempt to rewrite views.  I have spent a lot of time on this sort of thing, and I am hip to the obstacles you have enjoyed.  Funny how we both came to the conclusion we'd be better off with a constraint solver in there... enough trials and enough errors will do that.

I recently managed to hack my way to seeing Coll inferred correctly here:
{code}
def f[A, CC[X] <: Traversable[X], Coll <: CC[A]](xs: Coll) = xs
{code}
I have to get back to that code, it's in a tributary somewhere.
