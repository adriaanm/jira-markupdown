I'm not sure how the first one is being parsed to make this come back true, but it seems safe that it should be -0.0f or at worst a parse error, and not silently end up as 0.0f.
```scala
scala> import java.lang.Float                   
import java.lang.Float

scala> new Float(0.0f) equals new Float(-0.0f)  
res0: Boolean = true

scala> new Float(0.0f) equals new Float(-(0.0f))
res1: Boolean = false
```
