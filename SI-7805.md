Ordinary `scala -i x.script` seems broken on 2.11.

2.10 is ok:
{code}
apm@mara:~/tmp$ scala -i x.script
Loading x.script...
import util._

Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_25).

But not at least since M2:
{code}

I'll take on the onus of submitting something testable, if only to ensure that you don't wake up in a cold sweat with the rough touch of a rope necklace still fresh on your neck and a maniacal voice resounding, PAULP appears to hang!

The other view is software breakage is like catastrophic wildfire, it's necessary for fresh growth because otherwise you're too scared to break something in a misguided attempt to improve it.

That's in the absence of tests, of course.  When there are tests, you're too scared of breaking the tests.

This regressed somewhere in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1573. scala-hash is missing one or two binaries so I didn't get a precise lock on it. I would suspect https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/45c2d7f1

Note that before the regression the script was evaluated before the banner was displayed.
Here's a fix:

I'll humbly respect your claim on the test-writing detail. Maybe REPLTest can be tweaked for this purpose.
Do you think you can just move a LOC outside the curlies and that makes it all OK?

Do you ever sleep?

Comment of the day:
