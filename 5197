If people want to be able to contribute patches from outside, the onus needs to fall upon them to deal with any issues they cause.  I try to be a good samaritan by incorporating some outside patches but this right here is the primary basis of my increasing reluctance.  When I write a comment like "The linked list code looks hopelessly broken to me." as I did in SI-3361, it means I don't want to work on it: it means it'd be faster for me to   write it from scratch than to try to fix it.  So it's twice as unappealing to diagnose bugs arising from someone else working on it.

I'm sure this bug is trivial, but it's the principle.  I only want to accept patches from people with followthrough.  So I'm available to revert r22830, but I'm not available to patch the patch.
