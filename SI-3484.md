This works:

```scala
class cbf[A, B, C]

/**
 *  @define Coll Traversable
 *  @define bfreturn $$Coll
 */
class Collection[A] {
  /** What map does...
   *
   *  $$bfreturn
   *  @usecase def map[B](f: A => B): $$Coll[B]
   *
   */
  def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit fact: cbf[Collection[A], B, That]) = null
}
```


This does not (see the use case return type):


```scala
class cbf[A, B, C]

/**
 *  @define Coll Traversable
 *  @define bfreturn $$Coll
 */
class Collection[A] {
  /** What map does...
   *
   *  $$bfreturn
   *  @usecase def map[B](f: A => B): $$bfreturn[B]
   *
   */
  def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit fact: cbf[Collection[A], B, That]) = null
}
```

ScalaDoc outputs:

```scala
t.scala:16: warning: not found: type $$bfreturn
   *  @usecase def map[B](f: A => B): $$bfreturn[B]
               ^
model contains 3 documentable templates
one warning found
```

Note that the first occurence of `$$bfreturn` has been recognized, while the one in the use case is refused.
(In r24641) [scaladoc] Scaladoc should expand macros recursively. Closes #3484. Review by dubochet.
