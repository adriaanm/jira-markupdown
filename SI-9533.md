The [use case] label is more likely to be interpreted as a header for the following text than an indication the method signature is a simplified version.

In this the *use case* could be taken to be _Multiples up the elements ..._ .

Replacing [use case] with _Full Signature_ would be a twofold improvement,

# Make it clear the signature above is probably not the full signature
# Avoid the confusingly named _use case_

If _use case_ had to remain in some form then _simplified signature_ would be an improvement.
