The [use case] label is more likely to be interpreted as a header for the following text than an indication the method signature is a simplified version.

In this the **use case** could be taken to be *Multiples up the elements ...* .

Replacing [use case] with *Full Signature* would be a twofold improvement,

- Make it clear the signature above is probably not the full signature
- Avoid the confusingly named *use case*

If *use case* had to remain in some form then *simplified signature* would be an improvement.
