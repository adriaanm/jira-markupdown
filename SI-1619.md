Currently, it is published by the nested selection object itself.
In other words, listenTo(comboBox) makes better sense than listenTo(comboBox.selection).

See the following for the suggested changes to the code:

What I was 'up to' was writing an app to demo a library I've written, that's based on scala.swing; this I hope to make available shortly.

Okay, but I still think the Component should be publishing the event, since it is the Component which is given as the event's source:

```scala
case class SelectionChanged(override val source: Component) extends ComponentEvent with SelectionEvent
```
