The following code creates a VerifyError, in particular an Inconsistent stack height runtime error:
```scala
object Broken {
  def byval[A](a: => A) = a
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    var n = try { args(0).toInt } catch { case _ => 1 }
    byval(n)
  }
}
```

This may be related to bug scala/bug#2333 but demonstrates that the problem is not specific to lazy vals.  I cannot seem to figure out what the offending bytecode is, even after writing out what the stack should look like at each point.  Couldn't be a JVM bug, could it?!

Note that
```scala
def byref[A](a: A) = a
```
does not cause the same problem, but
```scala
def byfunc[A](a: () => A) = a()
```
does.  Also, note that vals work fine, as does assigning to a temporary variable (even another var--though this is because the code is then excised into liftedTree$$1, I think).

This code breaks in both 2.8.0.final and r23032.
