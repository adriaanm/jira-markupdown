In the version 2.6.1 RC1 of the Scala compiler, the implementation of flatMap in the trait Stream is no longer lazy. I.e., calling flatMap on a stream will evaluate the whole stream. With an infinite stream, the call will never return and cause in most cases an error "memory out of bound".


Fixed in r13498 (related to reopened ticket SI-153)
