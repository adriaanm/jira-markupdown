Sorry in advance if this is disallowed, but the following crashes when the field is object-private:

{code}
package eyeshadow

trait A {
  def a: Int
}

object Test {
  def f(a: Int) = new {
    //private val b = a
    private[this] val b = a // crashes, sorry scalac
  } with A {
    def a = b
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println(f(7).a)
  }
}
{code}

There is a failed assert
 at scala.tools.nsc.transform.Constructors$ConstructorTransformer$$anonfun$transformClassTemplate$1.apply(Constructors.scala:160)
or
`assert(fields.length == 1)`


The sample code does not crash as of 2.11.0-M3.

Thanks for reporting the progression. We like to hear to hear those now and then.

You're welcome.  Real gratitude would be an upvote on

Why do my dumb easy answers get upvotes while interesting answers get crickets?

Maybe I make easy stuff sound hard and interesting stuff sound like cricket bait.

It's OK if you don't support the speculative import syntax in the comment.  I'd forgotten about that.
