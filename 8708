To the original reporter: you should use `raw"c:\foo\bar"` or `raw"""c:\foo\bar"""` to avoid string escape processing. But beware, unicode escapes, e.g `\u1234` are still processed as they happen much much earlier. So `raw"c:\users"` doesn't work. You can actually turn off unicode escape processing with the compiler option `-Xno-uescape`. Or make your life easier, and use '/' in strings as path separators.
