Example:

```scala
scala> trait Bottom { val x = "Hello"}
defined trait Bottom

scala> trait Middle extends Bottom { println(s"x is $x") }
defined trait Middle

scala> class DumbTop extends Middle
defined class DumbTop

scala> class MeddlesomeTop extends Middle { override val x = "World"}
defined class MeddlesomeTop

scala> val dt = new DumbTop
x is Hello
dt: DumbTop = DumbTop@7a1a14a4

scala> val mt = new MeddlesomeTop
x is null
mt: MeddlesomeTop = MeddlesomeTop@4b40f651
```
The value of x is neither "Hello" as initialized in the base class (trait) not "World" as overridden in the derived class, but rather, null.

Expected behavior - should use the base class initialized value until/unless overridden in derived class initializers.

I don't think there is a canonical JIRA ticket on this. #54 is probably the oldest.
