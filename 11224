@Adriaan: you're right, that certainly is a problem. Although it seems that issue SI-8644 was filed for the newer jiline, not for the older version - this is the bug concerning "paste" which I also have, when using jiline 2.12 (specifically paste does not work, when '[' is contained in the code). So basically it's only the arrow keys which did not work under some circumstances for 2.11 vs. copy/paste and generally inserting square brackets using 2.12. I don't know, I would feel the latter is worse, but it can be annoying as well when the arrow keys don't work. I agree with Bjorn's statements here that these bugs really make a bad impression on newbies using Scala.
