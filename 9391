You might parse the duration from a config file.

The valid inputs are documented:
```scala
  /**
   * Construct a finite duration from the given length and time unit, where the latter is
   * looked up in a list of string representation. Valid choices are:
   *
   * `d, day, h, hour, min, minute, s, sec, second, ms, milli, millisecond, Âµs, micro, microsecond, ns, nano, nanosecond`
   * and their pluralized forms (for every but the first mentioned form of each unit, i.e. no "ds", but "days").
   */
  def apply(length: Long, unit: String): FiniteDuration   = new FiniteDuration(length,  Duration.timeUnit(unit))
```

I don't really see the issue here.
