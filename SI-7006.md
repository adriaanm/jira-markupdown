scalac generates bytecode which is unreachable. This problem affects performance.
I am enclosing two example:
1 - Look at method Test.crazy. From bytecode 68 to 76.
2 - Look at method KevoreeLazyJarResources.loadJar(jarFile:String). From 148 to 159.
I realized this because I am extending a JVM. The code run with JavaHotSpot but any way, this is not correct. The really weird is that in former case a lot of nop are generated. however, in the latter case it looks like if some code is duplicated. Maybe a potential source of bug
Regarding unreachable code. The new backend solves that issue, and the fix can be ported to GenASM. Here's the gist:

{noformat}
    /**
     *  When writing classfiles with "optimization level zero" (ie -neo:GenBCode)
     *  the very least we want to do is remove dead code beforehand,
     *  so as to prevent an artifact of stack-frames computation from showing up,
     *  the artifact described at http://asm.ow2.org/doc/developer-guide.html#deadcode
     *  That artifact results from the requirement by the Java 6 split verifier
     *  that a stack map frame be available for each basic block, even unreachable ones.
     *
     *  Just removing dead code might leave stale LocalVariableTable entries
     *  thus `cleanseMethod()` also gets rid of those.
     * */
    final def removeDeadCode() {
      for(mnode <- cnode.toMethodList; if Util.hasBytecodeInstructions(mnode)) {
        Util.computeMaxLocalsMaxStack(mnode)
        cleanseMethod(cnode.name, mnode) // remove unreachable code
      }
    }

I've created a separate ticket SI-7181 to deal with the finally block duplication
