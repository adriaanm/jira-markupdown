I attached a patch which declares constructors of anonymous functions as pure and thus, allows their removal.

Is this a sound approach? A all anonymous function constructors free of side-effects?

Another thing: Probably, the line
```scala
|| (sym.isConstructor && inliner.isClosureClass(sym.owner))
```
should have had the effect my patch now has. BUT: 
 1. This apparently does not work
 2. If it would work, it would be dangerous because general function classes could have some side-effects in their constructor.

Someone should review what is going on there...
