Looks like the CanBuildFrom implicit on TreeSet companion object is missing, possible from the implicit Ordering.   

We have two things to think about:

(1) Adding this implicit can be done in 2.10.1 in binary compatible way, but we should add some type-tests for this kind of thing.
(2) Should we be passing the implicit ordering **captured** by a collection?  My guess is no, since map can change the value type of the collection to something else.
