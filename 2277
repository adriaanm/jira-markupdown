My apologies I did a bunch of debugging and accidentally gave you the wrong code.  The bug occurs when the import is:

import scala.collection.JavaConversions._

So the complete test:  
import scala.collection.JavaConversions._

val jmap = new java.util.HashMap[String,Int]()
jmap("one") = 1
jmap("one")


I just tried it with scala-2.8.0.r18604-b20090830020201 (August 31 build) and it still crashes the compiler.
