Enable the use of spaces in paths for the Scala build on Windows.

- Revert r25995 which was fixing it only partly and in the wrong place.
- Properly encode argument files for scalac in scalac ant task.
- Allow 'compilerarg' elements in scalac ant task (like in ant's built-in
  javac task) to allow passing extra parameters like plugindir path with
  proper encoding of spaces and file names, and use it in the Scala build.
- Fix space handling in get-scala-revision.bat.
