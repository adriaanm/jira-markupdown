They are related, but what's at issue here is that we don't mangle package-private or object-private members at all, which means they are not private. In scala/bug#7475 it is attempting to do the right thing by mangling the private member, but the implementation has bugs -- whereas here we are not even trying to do the right thing.
```scala
package s {
  object o {
    trait A {
      private[this] val m1 = 1
      private       val m2 = 2
      private[A]    val m3 = 3
      private[o]    val m4 = 4
      private[s]    val m5 = 5
    }
    // Here is what that produces:
    // public abstract int s$o$A$$m1();
    // public abstract int s$o$A$$m2();
    // public abstract int s$o$A$$m3();
    // public abstract int m4();
    // public abstract int m5();
  }
}
```
