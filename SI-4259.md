=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala

Please see issue 4067. Scala generated class files cannot be used in Eclipse. 

I'm using Scala 2.9.0 and it works fine. I believe this is because it was fixed in Changeset 24063 

This is a fundamental and blocking issue and undermines project credibility.

```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

That Scala generates correct class files. 



=== What do you see instead? ===

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:
  - Java:
  - Operating system: 
For the record, the patch for #4067 is not sufficient and the dimensions of the problem aren't 100% clear yet, so nothing is going to happen too imminently.

I quote the last commenter:

So are you just telling me to shut up or does your posting indicate that this issue is being taken seriously?

If you heard me the first time, was that indicated by the totality of your response, "owner changed from scala_meeting to scala_reviewer"?

I also don't think your comment,"further exposition of your opinions regarding how we're measuring up to your standards is unlikely to accomplish anything" - is particularly mature, constructive or professional.

So what is the Scala project doing about this blocking issue?

"If your goal is to see the matter addressed expeditiously, rest assured I heard you the first time"

This problem has been known for 3 months, would you describe that as expeditious?
There's nothing "political" about it, and I wouldn't call it a discussion.

What do you even mean, "political"?????

This bug is three months old, I've spent 2 weeks trying to draw attention to it and find out about it's status.

If it breaks my workspace, it breaks a lot of other people's too.

It's not a pet peeve. If it were a clumsy interface or a method with a fence post error that would qualify as a pet peeve.

Breaking a users workspace because of generating invalid class files is another matter entirely.

So far the only response I've gotten back is has been obfuscation and no clear answers.  

It's been fixed, in HEAD. Nobody knows how, nobody knows when, some people think it was fixed in patch #4067, extempore says no. No elaboration. Just no, and forget about it.

So how about some answers rather than just shooting the messenger?
