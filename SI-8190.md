```scala

import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

object Test extends App {
  def foo(s: Symbol) = ???
  def foo(ts: TermSymbol) = ???
}
20:37 ~/Projects/Master/sandbox (master)$ scalac Test.scala
Test.scala:5: error: double definition:
def foo(s: reflect.runtime.universe.Symbol): Nothing at line 4 and
def foo(ts: reflect.runtime.universe.TermSymbol): Nothing at line 5
have same type after erasure: (s: scala.reflect.api.Symbols#SymbolApi)Nothing
  def foo(ts: TermSymbol) = ???
      ^
one error found
```
Here are the corresponding definitions:

```scala
type Symbol >: Null <: SymbolApi

type TermSymbol >: Null <: Symbol with TermSymbolApi
trait TermSymbolApi extends SymbolApi { this: TermSymbol => ... }
```

If one thinks about it, it's clear why TermSymbol erases to SymbolApi. Symbol is the first component of a compound type, and it erases to SymbolApi. 

I'll change TermSymbol to say <: TermSymbolApi with Symbol, but in the meanwhile we could think why not scan other components of compound types looking for a base class that refines the erasure of the first component.
