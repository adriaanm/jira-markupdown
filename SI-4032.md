I failed to find specification language either justifying or prohibiting this difference, but I was under the impression foo\(x\) is equivalent to this.foo\(x\), which here we can see it is not.

{code}
package object foo {
  type HasLogger = { def logger: Logger }
  implicit def mkLog(x: HasLogger) = new {
    def loggingExceptions(body: => Unit): Unit =
      try body
      catch { case ex: Exception => println(ex) }
  }
}

package foo {
  case class Logger(name: String) { }

  class B {
    def logger = Logger("B")

    // this compiles
    def f1 = this.loggingExceptions(println("hi"))

    // this does not:
    // def f2 = loggingExceptions(println("hi"))
    //
    // 1124.scala:20: error: not found: value loggingExceptions
    //     def f2 = loggingExceptions(println("hi"))
    //              ^
  }
}
{code}

The spec seems relatively clear on this point

Bindings:
>A reference to an unqualified (type- or term-) identifier x is bound by the unique
>binding, which a) defines an entity with name x in the same namespace as the identifier, and b) shadows all other bindings that define entities with name x in that namespace.
>
> It is an error if no such binding exists.

Views
> are applied .... in a selection e.m with e of type T , if the select or m does not denote a member of T

In this case, `loggingExceptions` isn't a definition or declaration in the enclosing class.

Which of course prompts me to check this:

{code}
scala> implicit def a2xx(a: Any) = new { def a(x: String) = x }
a2xx: (a: Any)java.lang.Object{def a(x: String): String}

scala> object A { a("") }
<console>:10: error: not found: value a
       object A { a("") }
                  ^

scala> object A { def a(x: Int) = x; a("") }
defined module A
{code}

Not so intuitive, but as per the spec, AFAICT.
I'm reopening this for reconsideration, because "this" is a real problem if one attempts, for example, to move foreach into an extension method.  It means you can preserve the source compatibility of calls to foreach almost everywhere, but not when a class invokes foreach on itself like
{code}
class X extends Seq[Int] { def bippy = foreach(println) }
{code}
because it ignores the implicit.  To me it is far more regular to have the type of the receiver dictate which implicits are eligible, including when the receiver is the invisible this.  Now that we have extension methods which offer significant advantages, others will run into this as well.
From a DSL perspective, omitting this creates illusion that a member was inherited.

Here, subclass is free to define its own help without override, or invoke help without this. Workaround is to mix-in.

{code}
object X extends App {
  implicit class `app help`(val app: App) {
    def help() = { println("Help!") ; sys.exit(0) }
  }
  println("Run")
  help()         // would be nice
}

{code}
