Ok, I see how I could use the @field meta annotation, but my problem
remains, because my annotation is defined in Java, since it needs
to be retained at runtime i.e. @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME).
Is it still the case that in order to reflec an annotation it needs 
to be defined in Java and have @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) ?
If yes, I'm between a rock and a hard place...

Thanks
