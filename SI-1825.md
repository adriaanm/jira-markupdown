The current implementation of Predef.assert is as follows:

{code}
def assert(assertion: Boolean) {
  if (!assertion)
    throw new java.lang.AssertionError("assertion failed")
}
{code}

This implementation has two problems.  First, it is not configurable.  There is no way to deactivate or activate assertions on a case-by-case basis (alla java's "-ea" switch).  This means that assertions will impact runtime performance as well as potential stability.  Assertions are meant for debug-time only and should impose no runtime penalty when deactivated.

The related second complaint is that assertion predicates are *always* evaluated (as the parameter is passed by-value).  Even if assertions were configurable, they would still impose a runtime penalty when deactivated due to this evaluation strategy.  The solution here (I believe) is to make the predicate and message call-by-name:

{code}
def assert(assertion: =>Boolean) {
  if (enableAssert && !assertion)
    throw new java.lang.AssertionError("assertion failed")
}
{code}

If `enableAssert` is false, then `!assertion` will never evaluate, meaning that `assertion` will never be evaluated, avoiding the performance penalty.  This still isn't as cheap as Java's primitive assertions, but it is I believe the best that Scala can do in a library.
I didn't know about the -Xdisable-assertions switch.  However, this switch is of limited utility unless it is also possible to disable the evaluation of the predicate at the same time.  I'm thinking of the following case:

{code}
def performTask(...) {
  assert(someExpensiveOp())
  ...
}
{code}

I think most users would find it a little odd if their "disabled" assertions continued to impose a runtime penalty.

I do realize that call-by-name is a tradeoff, but it's mostly in space rather than time.  I've performed some fairly extensive benchmarking including by-name vs by-value in a non-trivial application.  The conclusion (on a 1.5 JVM even) was that the JVM does a tremendous job of optimizing away a lot of things which *should* be quite expensive.  There was literally no appreciable difference between call-by-name and call-by-value in terms of timed performance.  Obviously, the permgen was a little more crowded, and the JVM did need to allocate a new object for each by-name param, but that object remained in the young heap and was thus allocated and deallocated without any significant cost.
