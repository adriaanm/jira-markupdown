There doesn't seem to be any ticket for this yet even though many of us see this message all the time:
```scala
[warn] doc-version (3.2.0-SNAPSHOT) was too long to be displayed in the webview, and will be left out. The max length is: XX.XX.XX-XXX
```

While spewing this message into the log for every page is a problem (once should be enough), the bigger issue is that longer version numbers are discarded. Even overflowing them in the HTML pages would be better than that. It may be ugly but at least it's still usable. Currently there is no way to tell what version you're looking at when it comes from a "non-release" build (e.g. the SHA-versioned builds we do all the time for the Scala distribution).
