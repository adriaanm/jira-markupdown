Currently {{foldRight}} overflows on long lists. Martin Odersky recommended to use reverse.foldLeft, but no such recommendation appears in the ScalaDocs - see discussion in SI-3295. But now SI-3295 is being discussed again in this topic
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/RrmfYQpTTfc/discussion
but if nothing happens there, documentation should be fixed (I volunteer to do that, if this bug is accepted).
Thanks for the assignment, but there's hope that it's fixed. To ensure that SI-2818 is reviewed, I've taken the liberty of scheduling the bug.
Closing as 'won't fix' because SI-2818 addressed the underlying problem head on.
