javac still reports missing symbols in classes with unresolved parents:
```
javac sandbox/Test.java
sandbox/Test.java:1: cannot find symbol
symbol: class Missing
public class Test extends Missing {
                          ^
sandbox/Test.java:3: cannot find symbol
symbol  : variable abracadabra
location: class Test
		System.out.println(abracadabra);
		                   ^
2 errors
```

I don't think we should treat this specially.
