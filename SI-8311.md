Just a personal wishlist for a type-aware lint tool. Not that it ought to be implemented in scala/scala, but until we have a better home for it, I'm collecting ideas here.

  - Collections
    - implicit search for `CanBuildFrom[Nothing]` (returns `fallbackStringCBF` !)
    - pattern matching on Seq with ::
    - use of views when iterators might do
    - use of breakout

  - Control flow
    - implicit val that resolves to itself (`implicit val stringToInt: Function1[String, Int] = new Function1[String, Int] { def apply(s: String): Int = s.toInt }`)
    - pattern matching analysis with inferred finality
    - dead code (flexible open/closed world assumption)

Thx, Adriaan. For the record, I was about to try a quick Abide rule, but the "simple framework for lint-like rule creation" part eluded me.

To paraphrase someone's recent tweet, "The trick to reading project READMEs is to resign yourself to the fact that you wonâ€™t solve your problem today."
