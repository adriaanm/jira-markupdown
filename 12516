Hmm, I don't claim to be an expert, but I think they are quite distinct.  scala/bug#6450 shows a false-positive in a seemingly yucky match involving wildcard types and `.isInstanceOf` and working directly with the `Some` class instead of `Option` class.  

scala/bug#10019 (this ticket) shows a false-negative in a seemingly very simple case.
