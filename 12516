Hmm, I don't claim to be an expert, but I think they are quite distinct.  SI-6450 shows a false-positive in a seemingly yucky match involving wildcard types and {{.isInstanceOf}} and working directly with the {{Some}} class instead of {{Option}} class.  

SI-10019 (this ticket) shows a false-negative in a seemingly very simple case.
