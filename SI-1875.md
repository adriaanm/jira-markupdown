It needlessly loops AND recurses:

Predef.iterable2ordered at line 209:
```scala
    while (res == 0 && these.hasNext)  
      res = if (those.hasNext) these.next compare those.next else 1  
    if (res == 0) {  
```
should be
```scala
    if( these.hasNext)  
      res = if (those.hasNext) these.next compare those.next else 1  
    if (res == 0) {  
```
It does not recurse (the call to compare is for element comparison), and it is linear, not quadratic.

How does your algorithm compare these two sequences: `xs = List(1, 2, 3)` and `ys = List(1, 2, 1)`?
