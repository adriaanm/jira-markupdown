Type Providers Backed By Remote Data and Services
Before you create a type provider that's backed by remote data and services, you must consider a range of issues that are inherent in connected programming. These issues include the following considerations:

 - schema mapping
 - liveness and invalidation in the presence of schema change
 - schema caching
 - asynchronous implementations of data access operations
 - supporting queries, including LINQ queries credentials and authentication

This topic doesn't explore these issues further.

Side note: that last link shows a nice facility: you can add documentation to generated members. We could do something similar if we extended allowed documentation in @doc annotations, rather than just in doc comments.
