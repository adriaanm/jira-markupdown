A simple JPA model:

{code}
@Entity
@Table(uniqueConstraints=Array(new UniqueConstraint(columnNames=Array("email"))))
class User(

    @Email
    @Required
    var email: String,

    @Required
    var password: String,

    var fullname: String

)
{code}
 
but the annotations on the constructor params (@Required,  @Email etc.) are not in the bytecode. This was working with 2.8beta
