Using the following ant script, the scalascript task is used to generate a shell script for executing scala programs.

```scala
<project name="example" default="go">
  <property name="scala.home" value="${user.home}/lib/scala"/>
  <property name="scala.lib.dir" value="${scala.home}/lib"/>
  <property name="scala.comp.jar" value="${scala.lib.dir}/scala-compiler.jar"/>
  <property name="scala.lib.jar" value="${scala.lib.dir}/scala-library.jar"/>
  <property name="build.dir" value="${basedir}/build"/>

  <target name="go">
    <mkdir dir="${build.dir}"/>

    <!-- Setup sbaz task for ant -->
    <taskdef resource="scala/tools/ant/antlib.xml">
      <classpath>
        <pathelement location="${scala.comp.jar}"/>
        <pathelement location="${scala.lib.jar}"/>
      </classpath>
    </taskdef>

    <!-- Generate bin scripts -->
    <scalascript
      file="${build.dir}/myBuggyScript"
      classpath="$SCALA_HOME/lib/scala-library.jar"
      class="com.example.Main"
      javaFlags="-Djava.util.logging.config.file=$SCALA_HOME/meta/logging.properties"
    />
  </target>
</project>
```

I would expect the generated Unix script to contain the TOOL_CLASSPATH value of: 
```scala
TOOL_CLASSPATH="$SCALA_HOME/lib/scala-library.jar"
```

I end up with a script having a classpath like the following:
```scala
TOOL_CLASSPATH="/home/matlikj/sources/packaging/java/$SCALA_HOME/lib/scala-library.jar"
```

Additionally, the windows batch file reflects the same incorrect path, though the slashes are correct for the Windows platform.

According to the Ant documentation found at http://ant.apache.org/manual/develop.html, the following processing is performed by Ant prior to passing a Path object to a setter method.
  Ant will tokenize the value specified in the build file, accepting : and ; as path separators. Relative path names will be interpreted as relative to the project's basedir.

This should probably be changed to be a String parameter, and the required processing logic for manipulating that string to support multiple platforms (including decision between $SCALA_HOME and %SCALA_HOME% variable format) should be done within the `scala.tools.ant.ScalaTool` class.

I chose the Compiler component when creating this ticket because the source exists in the scala/src/compiler directory.  I wasn't sure if this is the correct categorization.  I am available to implement this fix if it makes sense.  While I have committed code for sbaz, I have not tried touching code outside that space to date.
I think there should be both possibilities, setting an absolute path (we use that for instance in our `build.xml`, in `quick-bin`) and setting a string.

If you can come up with a patch that would be great.
