I would argue that this is really the same bug (albeit from a different perspective) as scala/bug#4776: had you been aware that the operation was a view, you might have had a better chance at reasoning that it would be stack-unsafe to chain a large number of transformations.

Note that we've got a high performance map (restricted to non-primitive keys) in Scala 2.11 called `AnyRefMap` that includes a strict operation `mapValuesNow`. This wasn't lifted into the interface for `Map`, though.
