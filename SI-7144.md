Since Scala 2.10 currying functions with repeated parameters seems to change the repeated parameters into a Seq[] parameter.

Code:
{quote}def doSomething(x: Int)(abc: Int*)(y: Int) = x + abc.sum * y
def doLess = doSomething(0)_{quote}

Output with Scala 2.9.2:
{quote}doSomething: (x: Int)(abc: Int*)(y: Int)Int
doLess: Int* => (Int => Int){quote}

Output with Scala 2.10.0:
{quote}doSomething: (x: Int)(abc: Int*)(y: Int)Int
doLess: Seq[Int] => (Int => Int){quote}


The old behavior was considered a bug. #4176 , fixed in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/771
