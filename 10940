Thanks Andy!

Looks good so far, just two small comments:

1. I'm not sure if the test description is entirely correct. Right now it's "listeners should not be called after they have been removed from the publisher". But that doesn't really reflect the original problem (and actually, is not what the test is testing). I'll attach a slightly modified version of the test in a minute, which (IMO) addresses both issues.

2. Is the containsItem() method really needed? It's essentially the same as the contains() one, just without the purging part. IOW: couldn't one just use the contains() method, or is there a performance hit? And if so, would it make sense to name it somewhat differently ("containsNoPurge()" or so - I know, not really a good name either...) and/or make it protected, to avoid confusion with the contains() method?
