running the example below (taken from http://programming-scala.labs.oreilly.com/ch08.html) in REPL produces different
result (error !) than run as "scala.bat script.scala"

scala 2.8.x (from 2. sept 2009)
java 1.6.0_13

remarks:
  a) when run as script a second java.exe is started and never ended - is that a normal behavior ?

  b) i am not sure, but i looks like the guard "if i == 1" never returns true (broken "==" ?)

example:
```scala
  def factorial(i: BigInt): BigInt = i match {
    case _ if i == 1 => i
    case _ => i * factorial(i - 1)
  }

  println(factorial(3))
```
