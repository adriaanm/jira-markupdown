Maybe I did find something interesting after all. The Eclipse plugin no longer reports any errors in my Lift code, but a command line compile produces a very large error message. I tried compiling my contrived example as well and got a similar error message. I attached both the contrived code (Mapper.scala), and the error message I get when compiling it(error.txt). Again, Eclipse reports no errors with Mapper.scala either. 

The error message begins along the lines of :
exception when traversing ((tr: TestRun) => tr.testSubject)
