When an import adds in scope an object with the same name as a class defined in the package, the {{imported `SomeClass' is permanently hidden by ...}} warning makes it look like the import statement is not useful. When in fact it might be used to access the elements of the object.

The warning appears with the following files, and the code doesn't compile anymore if the import is removed.

{code:scala|title=anotherpackage/SomeClass.scala}
package anotherpackage

object SomeClass {
  val CONST= 1
}
{code}

{code:scala|title=apackage/ScalaClass.scala}
package apackage

import anotherpackage.SomeClass  // permanently hidden warning here

class ScalaClass {
  val i = SomeClass.CONST  // error if the import is removed
}

class SomeClass {

}
{code}

To be fair, the warning states that the *class* is hidden, not the object.

The only way to have code that compiles without warning is to use an import rename.
