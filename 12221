The problem may be less exotic than it seems because specs2 uses DelayedInit. The [original example|https://github.com/lrytz/reactive-stocks/blob/master/test/actors/UserActorSpec.scala] is along these lines:

{code}
  "UserActor" should {
    val symbol = "ABC"
    "do stuff" in new WithApplication {
      userActor.receive(StockUpdate(symbol, ...))
{code}

where {{WithApplication}} extends {{DelayedInit}}, the captured {{symbol}} causes the failure.
