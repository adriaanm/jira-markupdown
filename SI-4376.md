SLS 4.5 says:
{code}
References to the type parameters in object-private values, variables,
or methods (ยง5.2) of the class are not checked for their variance
position. In these members the type parameter may appear anywhere
without restricting its legal variance annota- tions.
{code}
where object-private is defined:
{code}
Members marked private without a qualifier are called class-private,
whereas members labeled with private[this] are called object-private.
{code}
Since the resolution of SI-4345 involved both examples compiling, I take it that the language in SLS 4.5 should include both private[this] and protected[this].

Terminology suggestion: the term "object-protected" is not used in the spec.  The term "object-local" is used only once, in "Changes in Version 2.4 (09-Mar-2007)".  "object-local" sounds like a sensible term to define and then use to enclose private[this] and protected[this].

(In r24735) Closes SI-4376 by adding definition for object-protected. No review.
