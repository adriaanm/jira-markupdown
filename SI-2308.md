Hey adriaan - I have been working on a new toy, it still needs some polish before general usage but I went searching for regressions to test it out.

Awesome! Git bissect and scalatest, together at last?

I didn't, actually, so that's good to know. However, I don't think this **caused** the bug, it simply lifted the rock under which it was hiding. It's got something to do with scoping and symbols being entered with the right type params, but then all of a sudden the next lookup of that symbol doesn't see the type params yet. I've been trying to debug it, but haven't found a good strategy yet...
I've been digging into this a little deeper. 

For the first problem:

```scala
trait T[A[_]];
object Bug2308A {
  type T1 = T[B] forSome { type B[_] }
}
```

A naive trip through the debugger suggests that:

 1. `RefChecks.transformStat:928` substitutes the existential parameter `B[_]` with `WildcardType`.
 1. `Infer.checkKindBoundsHK` compares the type argument `WildcardType` with the type parameter `A[_]`, and reports the arity mismatch.

Perhaps `RefChecks.transformStat` could be modified to replaced existential types with a wildcard with the same structure (e.g. `B[_]` => `new WildCardParameterisedType(WildCardType)`; or `checkKindBoundsHK` could add a special case to short circuit the check.

----

The second problem, which is blocking the port of part of Scalaz, is eluding me. It is minimally:

```scala
trait Request[IN[_]]
trait T[A]
(null: Request[T]) : (Request[IN] forSome { type IN[_] })
```

Which part of the type conformance checking should return true for `T <:< IN[_]` ? `Types.isHKSubType0` does not, as `(tp1.normalize, tp2.normalize)` results in a pair of type  `(TypeVar, PolyType)`, which falls through to the default case. But I could be looking in entirely the wrong place...
I overlooked that this involves higher-kinded existentials -- it's non-trivial to support those. See also #1369.
other dups: #975, #1227
higher-kinded existentials were introduced in r12113
Another usecase for this is accessing the class of a type that has a higher kinded type parameter:

```scala
scala> trait T[M[_]]
defined trait T

scala> classOf[T[X] forSome{ type X[_] }]
<console>:5: error: kinds of the type arguments (?) do not conform to the expect
ed kinds of the type parameters (type M) in trait T.
?'s type parameters do not match type M's expected parameters: <none> has no typ
e parameters, but type M has one
```
(extempore in [r25114](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25114)) When TypeVars were given higher-order abilities, so too should
have been WildcardType, which acts as a plceholder for typevars.
Always inflicting arguments upon it was the cause of #2308.
Closes #2308, review by moors.
