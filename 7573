One cannot write [T: ArrayTag], because then it will need to come from a macro def, and macro defs cannot have context bounds, as we've seen in SI-5744. Even if we supported context bounds and, consequently, ArrayTag ascriptions, those would transform into free terms, which are prohibited in macro expansions.
