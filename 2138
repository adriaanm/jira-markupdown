(In r22463) Took a cue from mharrah that we don't need to build global static
data to keep track of something when we know where it's kept.
Altered the Enumeration deserialization scheme to use reflection, preserving
the singleton property by delivering the MODULE$$ singleton.  This solves
the GC issue and lets us drop synchronization to boot.  Also added
some graceful failure for malformed Enumerations.  All tests look good
but a second opinion is in order: closes SI-2214, review by phaller.
