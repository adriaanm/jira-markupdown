A simple ping-pong throughput test of Akka yields 10-40% lower throughput with Scala 2.12 than 2.11. Reproducer project: https://github.com/johanandren/akka-ping-pong run with forked `run` from inside of sbt and `++2.12.0` followed by `run` to run bench on 2.12

Original Akka ticket: https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/21910

Used yourkit and looked at allocation rates/gc which is a tiny bit worse but not enough to explain it (I think), nothing obvious from CPU trace profiling either (see attached yourkit snapshots, sorry about bz2 but couldn't get them small enought to attach with zip).
We recently found a performance problem with `groupBy` which turned out to be caused by an extra level of indirection introduced by the 2.12.x trait encoding.

I notice some "inlining too deep" notices in the `-XX:+PrintInlining` output under 2.12 for this test:

See: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5528 / #10009.

In that case, we refactored the hot code to avoid depending on JVM inlining so heavily. 

However, in your case I'm not able to improve performance with `-XX:MaxInlineLevel=` set to 12 or 15, so you might have a different problem altogether.
After building an Akka artifact for 2.12 with `-Xmixin-force-forwarders:true` a single threaded dispatcher seemed to be on par for 2.11 and 2.12 but going back to the default dispatcher with more threads 2.12 still lands at ~45% slower.
`-Xmixin-force-forwarders:true` is the default on 2.12.0.
Tried building/running with `2.12.1-c2eb299-nightly`, no improvement.
I bisected the regression (or maybe, the dominant regression) to our removal of scala.concurrent.forkjoin in favour of direct use of the JDK implementation.

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/fa8012d28687986902ce1255a19f9f49affb3bca

In https://github.com/johanandren/akka-ping-pong/compare/master...retronym:embed-akka, I changed Akka dispatcher and mailbox code to j.u.c.ForkJoin directly. This also shows the regression with 2.11.8.

Prior to removing it, our fork of ForkJoin was at:

Not sure if this is useful, but a user in the Akka community wanted to do the same in a patch version of Akka but ended up with the observation that Java 8 and Scala 2.11 includes different versions of JSR166 and we then closed the ticket:
https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/21101#issuecomment-241262882

Heres the revision log of ForkJoinPool in the JDK8 updates branch:

http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/log/8b04ee324a1a/src/share/classes/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.java

I think the last commit, discussed as https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8080623, might be relevant. As far as I can tell the benchmark only has two threads worth of work to do (one ping and one pong actor), so the 100% cpu utilization on machines with >2 cores was busy waiting. Throughput was certainly improved with this tactic, but:

```

Unfortunately the spinning has shown to be fairly CPU intensive causing overall performance regressions in applications due to less CPU available for the other parts of the application not running as FJ tasks. 

The recommendation which has been discussed with Doug Lea is to disable the spinning for JDK 8, and for JDK 9 continue the ongoing Work and research to solve the active waiting without spinning. Depending on timing of this work it may potentially be back ported to a later release of 8u.
```
