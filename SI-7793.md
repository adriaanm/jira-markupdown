Me: "i'd like to switch this around so that no cross-library inlining happened other than for @inline annotated methods"


A few preliminary observations:

# ruling out all forms of cross-library inlining would also result in {{Range.foreach}} and similar not being inlined, which might not be what one wants.
# the following method can be used to prevent the inliner from loading bytecode for inlining:
{noformat}
    def shouldLoadImplFor(sym: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Boolean = {
      def alwaysLoad    = (receiver.enclosingPackage == RuntimePackage) || (receiver == PredefModule.moduleClass)
      def loadCondition = sym.isEffectivelyFinal && isMonadicMethod(sym) && isHigherOrderMethod(sym)

      val res = hasInline(sym) || alwaysLoad || loadCondition
      debuglog("shouldLoadImplFor: " + receiver + "." + sym + ": " + res)
      res
    }
{noformat}
# Another useful method is {{Global.Run.compiles(sym: Symbol)}} which tells us whether, say, a method is part of the program being compiled:
{noformat}
    /** does this run compile given class, module, or case factory? */
    // NOTE: Early initialized members temporarily typechecked before the enclosing class, see typedPrimaryConstrBody!
    //       Here we work around that wrinkle by claiming that a top-level, early-initialized member is compiled in
    //       *every* run. This approximation works because this method is exclusively called with `this` == `currentRun`.
    def compiles(sym: Symbol): Boolean =
      if (sym == NoSymbol) false
      else if (symSource.isDefinedAt(sym)) true
      else if (sym.isTopLevel && sym.isEarlyInitialized) true
      else if (!sym.isTopLevel) compiles(sym.enclosingTopLevelClass)
      else if (sym.isModuleClass) compiles(sym.sourceModule)
      else false
{noformat}
