The following code snippet compiles just fine on 2.10.4 but causes a `MatchError` at runtime because the Iterable `m.keys` uses a `Set`, which does not have the `Cons` operator like lists.

```scala
val m = Map(0 -> false, 1 -> true)
m.keys match {
  case Nil => "oops"
  case x :: xs => "ok"
}
```
A compile-time error would be nice.

The following bit does not compile (on 2.11.8):

```scala
Set(1,2,3) match {
  case Nil => "oops"
  case x :: xs => "ok"
}
```

Whereas the following works just fine:

```scala
Iterable(1,2,3) match {
  case Nil => "oops"
  case x :: xs => "ok"
}
```

Since `m.keys` produces an `Iterable` I would either expect it to compile and run fine or say at compile time that it's not possible because a `Set` is used in the background and sets don't allow `Cons`. 

I'm not sure this if feasible (or desired) really. I'm just saying that `Set` and `Iterable` produce results I expect but with the `Map.keys` method the results are not as clear cut (unless I'm missing something fundamental here) even though as a user I should not be too fazed about the implementation in the background.
There are calls for a lint warning for decomposing `Seq` with `::`. Maybe a back-stop warning for "abuse of cons".

```scala
scala> Seq(1,2) match { case head :: tail => }

scala> (Vector(1,2): Seq[Int]) match { case head :: tail => }
scala.MatchError: Vector(1, 2) (of class scala.collection.immutable.Vector)
  ... 28 elided
```

Similarly, for [collections usage errors](https://github.com/scala/scala-abide/issues/71) and [awry types](https://github.com/scala/scala-abide/issues/70).

In this case, using `m.keySet` is safer. A typelevel lint rule would probably just emit a special exhaustiveness warning, given some knowledge about the library; but a lint tool that knows the runtime type for your version of the API would be handy.
