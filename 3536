scala> val b: Boolean = false
b: Boolean = false

scala> b match { case false => true }
<console>:9: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: true
              b match { case false => true }
              ^
res0: Boolean = true

scala> b match { case true => true; case false => false; case _ => true }
res1: Boolean = false
