I tried to comment out all the code of the suspect class ... reducing it to the class header and the imports ... and I still got the error !
I still got the error until I commented out:
  import java.sql.ResultSet

In this project I have a dependency to a sqlite driver, namely sqlite-jdbc-3.6.16.jar.
I have no idea if this dependency is a problem or if it is the reference to java.sql.ResultSet.

Any idea?
