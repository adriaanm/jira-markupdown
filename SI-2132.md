Just a missing = gives a not really helpful error message - especially not suitable for beginners. The message directs not to the root of the problem.

See yourself:
{code}
scala> def foo():Int { 0 }
<console>:1: error: illegal start of declaration
       def foo():Int { 0 }
                       ^

scala> def foo():Int = { 0 }
foo: ()Int
{code}

I don't think we can do anything here. The problem is that the parser tries to create a refinement type

{code}
def foo: Int { /* some declarations */ }
{code}

and sees {{0}} instead of a declaration. So the error message is correct.
I vote for this too. It's very frustrating to see this unhelpful message when the actual problem is a missing '=' somewhere else. The parser message may be correct but it's absolutely useless for the user. See here:

{code}
def foo(): Unit { <- actual problem is HERE (missing '=' before '{' )
 val x = 1  //
 println(x) //
 println(x) //
 println(x) //
 println(x) //
 //lots of other code here
 println(x) <- error message on THIS line!
}
{code}
