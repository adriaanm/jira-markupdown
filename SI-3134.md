Type-safe generic methods operating on Enumerations and returning a Value need to have signatures of the form

{code}
def method[E <: Enumeration](e: E): E#Value
{code}

since it is not possible to specify the type of a particular instance:

{code}
def cantDoThis[E <: Enumeration](e: E): e.Value
{code}

The former is arguably typesafe enough, but unfortunately there is a bug in the implementation of inner class types inside objects:

{code}
object BugTestCase {
  object Broken extends Enumeration { val zero = Value }
  def getZero[E <: Enumeration](enum: E): E#Value = enum.withName("zero")
  val correctlyTyped = getZero(Broken)
  val wronglyTyped: Broken.type#Value = null
  // val shouldWork: Broken.type#Value = getZero(Broken)

  class Workaround extends Enumeration { val zero = Value }
  lazy val Working = new Workaround
  val actuallyWorks: Workaround#Value = getZero(Working)
}
{code}

Note that the Workaround class/lazy val pair _should_ be equivalent to a companion object, but there is no way to write the correct type signature for the companion object.  Although type inference works correctly, the REPL reports:

{code}
scala> BugTestCase.correctlyTyped
res0: BugTestCase.Broken#Value = zero

scala> BugTestCase.wronglyTyped
res1: BugTestCase.Broken.Value = null
{code}

This makes it necessary to use one's own singleton objects instead of the language-supported ones.  Either Broken.type#Value should mean Broken$$#Value (where Broken$$ is the class of the singleton object), or Broken#Value should be valid syntax and mean that, or E#Value should be equivalent to Broken.Value.

This is as specified.  Broken.type#Value does mean what you want it to, but singleton types are not inferred.
{code}
  val doesWork: Broken.type#Value = getZero[Broken.type](Broken)
{code}
The request was filed as an "enhancement" instead of a "bug" because the specification, while accurately followed, is awkward.  It seems that the correct status would be "wontfix" in that case.

Also, the "invalid" resolution does not address the complaint that the generic applied to a singleton returned a type that I cannot refer to.  It inferred _something_, just not anything that I could specify (see REPL output res0 and compare to res1).

(I do not intend to start a debate, just clarify the original posting; if this matter requires further discussion, I'll pick it up on scala-debate or some other appropriate venue.)

Quite possibly.  As singleton type inference had already been closed wontfix in SI-1208 and duplicate in others since, I figured why not cover the bases.

You may be interested to know that if you use the right command line options, you can define the method as you desire.  When or if dependent method types will appear for real I cannot say.  And yes, mailing list would be a better place.

  // def getZero[E <: Enumeration](enum: E): E#Value = enum.withName("zero")
  def getZero[E <: Enumeration](enum: E): enum.Value = enum.withName("zero")

scala> BugTestCase.correctlyTyped
res0: BugTestCase.Broken.Value = zero
scala> BugTestCase.wronglyTyped
res1: BugTestCase.Broken.Value = null
