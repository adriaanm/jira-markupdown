When the parsers that are constructed by parser combinators would have a filter method then they would work with for comprehensions even more effectively.

The following definition should work:

```scala
Parser[T] {
...
  def filter(p: T => Boolean) =
    this >> (x => if (p(x)) success(x) else failure("predicate not satisfied")) }
...
}
```
FWIW, there has long been a comment in the combinator source:
```scala
  // no filter yet, dealing with zero is tricky!
```
Tricky how exactly? That is for us to derive.
Please, please rethink your decision. In some situations the need for a custom error message might not be important. In such situations the use of the filter method in for comprehensions would be a perfect fit.

In addition, I am really astonished. In general, the Scala APIs offer a wealth of methods, not all of them always being strictly necessary. The same is true for "Parser". For example there a three methods in the Parser class named ">>", "flatMap", and "into" offering the same functionality. So why not offering a filter method that would really increase the capability?
