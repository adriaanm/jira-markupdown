The following code compiles fine under scalac:

{code}
case class Test(one : Int, two : Int)
object Test{
 def apply(one : Int): Test = Test(one, 2);
}
{code}

But when I try to load it under the interpreter, I get the following error:

{code}
:7: error: wrong number of arguments for method apply: (Int)Test in object Test
        def apply(one : Int): Test = Test(one, 2);
{code}


And when I try to run it with the script runner, I get the following errors:


{code}
(fragment of caseclass.scala):2: error: Test is already defined as object Test
object Test{
        ^
(fragment of caseclass.scala):3: error: wrong number of arguments for method apply: (Int)Test in object Test
 def apply(one : Int): Test = Test(one, 2);
                               ^
{code}

I'd expect correct behavior of the interpreter and the script runner when using case classes with companion objects.
The problem is with namers, and even wrapping the case object and companion class shouldn't help (someone can verify? I don't have enough experience running the interpreter). The problem is that given the way that case classes add the apply/unapply method to its companion object prevents separate compilation of the two: they have to always be recompiled together. I think the interpreter assumes separate compilation is possible, right? I'd like to get Lex's opinion on this before I can figure out if there is a quick fix for this or not.


Wrapping them *does work*:
{code}
scala> object Outer {
     | case class Test(one : Int, two : Int)
     | object Test{
     |  def apply(one : Int): Test = Test(one, 2);
     | }
     | }
defined module Outer
{code}
Ok, then here is what we know:

(a) case classes and companion objects will never work in the interpreter if they both refer to the other.

(b) 

{code}
object Foo
case class Foo(x : Int) 
{code}

will work in the interpreter and not in script runner. There is a separate bug for script runner, I'll break that out and assign it to Martin.

(c)

{code}
case class Foo(x : Int)
object Foo {
  def foo = Foo(10)
}
{code}

used to work (pre 2.7) and doesn't work anymore.


(d) the user can always wrap the case class/companion object in an object to force co-compilation.

Also:

(e) Not fixing this in the interpreter is probably not a big deal given the interpreter's other limitations (can't deal with recursive methods).

(f) If we don't want to fix this, then the error messages for failure should be improved (or the user will be WTF that the object has already been defined when they don't see that).

Reassigning to Martin, since case classes are his baby he should decide on fix or wontfix.
