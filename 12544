"Concretely, when computing the type of an overriding field, the type of the overridden field is used as the expected type. As a result, the inferred type of a val or lazy val may change in Scala 2.12." http://scala-lang.org/news/2.12.0

In your example, the type of the lazy val is simply A. If you want the structural type, you can explicitly declare it:

{code:scala}
lazy val obj: A { def x: Int } = ...
{code}
