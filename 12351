[~jrudolph] It's impossible to generalize 100% about this, since if a particular issue is really severe enough, the rules change. (That's how 2.10.6 happened, and there are probably other examples in Scala history.)

I closed this ticket because I strongly suspect the core team won't be addressing it for 2.11.x, on the grounds that it isn't critical. It appears to me that in a real codebase, working around it wouldn't be that painful.

If you think the regression is important enough that we ought to reconsider whether we tackle this ourselves, go ahead and make your argument here.

Also, we could still accept a fix for 2.11.x that someone else submitted. Whether such a patch would be accepted for 2.11.9 would depend on the usual risk/benefit tradeoffs.
