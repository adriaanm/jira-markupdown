`@BeanProperty` is a Java-compatibility tool, it helps you integrating your Scala code with certain Java frameworks.  The generated `set*` and `get*` methods are just aliases for the Scala getter and setter, and they will have the same visibility.

If you want custom getters or setters, you have to write them manually. It's true that this then does not integrate nicely with `@BeanProperty`, this problem has been identified before (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/scala-user/beanproperty/scala-user/CQv2OXttTm8/OvFKJ4-Mf4EJ).
