Can you do something to avoid x$3 in error message? I think that `ls` instead of `x$3` will be much better

{code}
type OI = Option[Int]
def boo(z: OI, ls: List[OI], rs: List[OI]): (List[OI], List[OI]) = {
      val (ls,rs) = z match {
        case Some(_) => (z::ls, rs)
        case _       => (ls, z::rs)
      }
      (ls,rs)
}

/* recursive value x$3 needs type
      val (ls,rs): (List[OI], List[OI]) = z match {
           ^
*/
{code}

P.S. Please change priority because I can't
