We have a codebase, called "antigone" which is caused the patmat phase of compilation to throw an OutOfMemoryError when compiled with -Xmx2g, where previously it would compile just fine with -Xmx700m (I have had to make no code changes as part of the upgrade).

I am privately sending Jason a heap dump from the profiler
The heap dump shows about 188k strongly reachable instances of `Solving$SolverLit`, an internal data structure in the pattern matcher used to calculating exhaustivity / reachability of matches.

What is the minimum memory needed to compile? Does, say, 1.2G work?

It would be good to track this down to a smaller test case.

A blackbox way to do this:

```scala
SOURCES=$(find src -name '*.scala')
CP=foo.jar:bar.jar
echo jointly compiling everthing with copious memory
scalac J-Xmx4G -d target/classes -classpath $CP ... $SOURCES
for s in $SOURCES; do
  echo individually compiling $s with limited memory
  scalac J-Xmx500M -classpath target/classes:$CP $s
done
```

Looking at your heap dump, it looks like the OOME was triggered during:

   antigone\src\gsa\antigone\angkor\transmission.scala

But that's not 100% reliable, something could have leaked before then and that file was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

Can you also please try compiling with `scalac -Dscalac.patmat.analysisBudget=0` which turns of the pattern matcher analysis.
I suspect that #7020 / https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/69557da5539a5a5132100fdab931e69f82139e15 might be to blame for a constant-factor increase in space usage.
Great!

I suspect that you could workaround the problem by changing:

```scala
val x: LargeEnum = ...
x match { case V1 => ;case V2; ... }
// will disable the analysis for exhaustiveness
(x: Any) match { case V1 => ;case V2; ... }
```
OK - here we go. I've attached a number of files. The behaviour only seems to manifest itself when scalac is not also compiling the Enum.

WriteEnum.scala - if you compile & run this, it will generate a file C:/tmp/SI8531/foobar/MyEnum.java (I've attached this file)

Open a command prompt on C:/tmp/SI8531 and run the following:

C:\tmp\SI8531>javac foobar\MyEnum.java
C:\tmp\SI8531>jar cvf foobar.jar foobar/MyEnum.class
added manifest
adding: foobar/MyEnum.class(in = 10238) (out= 4603)(deflated 55%)

(I've attached foobar.jar so you can skip this step)

Now try and compile SI8531.scala with foobar.jar on the classpath - it takes **ages**. (Equivalently, you can skip the creation of the JAR and just compile SI8531 with the directory C:/tmp/SI8531 on the classpath)
Thanks for the test case.

@oxbowlakes Hey Chris, I'm going to reclose this, but I'd invite you to have another go at trying to reproduce this with the latest build and to open a new ticket if something is still broken or has regressed.
