When there is a warning or an error, the Hint should display the error rather than regular type information.

Snippet:

       var bFound : boolean = false

Here boolean is deprecated ; the proper message is shown in the Problems tab as a warning:

"type boolean in object Predef is deprecated"

whereas the tooltip hint states the type

"scala.Predef.boolean"
