(This ticket was originally about being unable to build with both -Ydebug and -verbose enabled.)

Either option can be used alone, but attempting to build with both leads to almost immediate failure along the lines of:
```scala
[scalacfork] error: error while loading Class, class file '/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5.0/Classes/classes.jar(java/lang/Class.class)' is broken
[scalacfork] (No class file for /scala/trunk/src/library/scala/Array.scala was found
```
Unfortunately some of the thornier issues I'm trying to debug have interesting data spread out among these two outputs so I'd really like to be able to see both at once all the way from bootstrap.  Even commenting out all the spots in the source which say "if (settings.debug.value && settings.verbose.value)" did not enable it to proceed, so I'm thinking something is being initialized earlier than expected or in the wrong order because of a combination of code paths.
