Here there are:
{code}
package scala.swing

import scala.actors._

object SwingWorker {

}

abstract class SwingWorker extends Actor {
  def queue() {

  }

  def done() {

  }

  private var _cancelled = false
  def cancelled: Boolean = _cancelled
  def cancelled_=(b: Boolean) { _cancelled = b }
}
{code}

{code}
package scala.swing

import scala.actors._

// Dummy to keep ant from recompiling on every run.
trait SwingActor { }
{code}




My interpretation of the word is to "round up and exterminate." I'd code it in a hybrid functional/imperative manner:

{code}
def cull[A](as: Seq[A], cond: A => Boolean, action: A => Unit): Seq[A] =
  val (theUnlucky, theLucky) = as partition cond
  theUnlucky foreach action
  theLucky
}
{code}

Stay tuned for an easier-to-contribute-to incarnation of scala-swing post 2.10.0.

Unless Scala Actors are going to be still around with 2.11, this *must* be deprecated on 2.10.x.

As for undocumented, etc, etc, I've found another program using it.
