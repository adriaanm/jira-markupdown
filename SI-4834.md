According to the Scala coding standards, methods with side effects should have empty parenthesis. Hence, in `collection.mutable.PriorityQueue` the dequeuing method is `dequeue()`. However, the `dequeueAll` method has only a single argument list which carries the implicit `CanBuildFrom`. Thus you cannot call `pq.dequeueAll()`.

So if I'm not mistaken, the signature should be

```scala
def dequeueAll[A1 >: A, That]()(implicit bf: scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[_, A1, That]): That 
```

?
Technically, we're not able to make this change without a deprecation cycle, as it might break source compatibility. (Consider code that calls an `apply()` method on the returned `That`.)
