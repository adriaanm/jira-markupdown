Inherit static method from Java class is not recognized by Scala class
Here there is an small and simple example:

```scala
MyClass.java
public class MyClass extends MyClassBase {}

abstract class MyClassBase {
  public static void myStaticBaseMethod() {}
}

MyScalaClass.scala
class MyScalaClass {
  MyClassBase.myStaticBaseMethod() //compiles
  MyClass.myStaticBaseMethod() //no compiles. Wrong!!!
}
```
stumbled into another problem while exploring this in the repl

```scala
scala> MyClassBase.myStaticBaseMethod()
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class MyClassBase from class 
	at .<init>(<console>:8)
```
in both 2.11.8 and 2.12.0, the IllegalAccessError mentioned by Adriaan no longer occurs. (You correctly get a "object MyClassBase cannot be accessed in package <empty>" compile-time error, because MyClassBase isn't declared public.)

As for the original issue, I suggest we simply close it as "Not a Bug". Scala simply doesn't have the Java concept of statics. We have companion objects instead, but no inheritance relationship exists between the companion objects of a subclass and a superclass. Following Java here and allowing `MyClass.myStaticBaseMethod` wouldn't be consistent with that.

You can call the method through the superclass, so I don't see that any actual interop problem arises here.
I see why supporting the same concept wouldn't make sense in Scala (and would probably introduce unnecessary complexity).
Do you think it would be feasible just to introduce an error message that can be a little bit friendlier towards those coming from Java, perhaps suggesting what the user can do?
I've just stumbled on this error trying to use static methods defined on an `InputFormat` implementation to run a job on Spark (Hadoop ecosystem, in particular I'm using an `AccumuloInputFormat`).
