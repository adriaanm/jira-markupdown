I had thought I checked in a workaround in r18719, but I noticed only now that the workaround didn't even work, so I checked in a new more brute-force attempt in r18806.  This seems like a sketchy situation and it's not apparent to me what to do.

See also scala/bug#2087.
```scala
scala> def foo = new (Short => Char) { def apply(x: Short) = x.toChar }
foo: java.lang.Object with (Short) => Char

// here is where it would crash without the workaround
scala> foo(-100)                                                       
res0: Char = ?

// but through the front door it figures things out.
scala> java.lang.Character.valueOf((-100).toChar)
res0: java.lang.Character = ?
```
