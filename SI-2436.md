As soon as I change something in the interface of a trait, like the name or signature of a method, the name of the trait will be underlined red, and I get the error message "Foo is already defined as trait Foo".
If I close the file and reopen it, the error is gone.


Thanks for the report, but this is a duplicate of SI-1277 which is fixed on trunk.
