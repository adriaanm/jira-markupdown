@transient vars with traits are still not transfered into the resulting class as transient fields.

given the following scenario:

---8<---
trait Log {
  @transient var logger: String = _

  def log = {
    if( logger==null )
      logger = "I'm new here"
    logger
  }
}

object ScalaTest extends Log {

  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    System.out.println( log )
  }
}
---8<---

object ScalaTest should have a transient field 'logger' when the trait's applied. currently, it's generated just as a private field.
