I apologize for non reducing the bug yet, I can do it if needed.
*Scenario*: I mark a tail-recursive function with @tailrec, but when I compile it I get the wrong reason why it cannot be optimized: it complains that the base case (non-recursive) is a recursive call not in tail position! If I comment out this call and replace it with a value, I get a more reasonable error: this function in fact uses _polymorphic_ tail-recursion, which according to the error is not supported (which is kind-of fine, even though in principle it should be easy to support that case as well*).
Making the call non-polymorphic fixes indeed the problem.

*Example*: Concretely, the code is the following:
{code}
  @tailrec private def usesArgAtMostOnce[S, T](f: Fun[S, T], v: Exp[_]): Boolean = {
    f match {
      case FuncExpBody(FlatMap(ExpSeq(Seq(v2)), g)) if !v2.isOrContains(v) =>
        usesArgAtMostOnce(g, v)
      case FuncExpBody(FlatMap(baseUsingV, g)) =>
        val occurrences = baseUsingV.findTotFun(_ == v) //XXX check occurrences.
        occurrences.length == 1
        //false
      case _ => false
    }
{code}
And the error is the following:
{code}
/Users/pgiarrusso/Documents/Research/Sorgenti/linqonsteroids/src/main/scala/ivm/optimization/Optimization.scala:542: could not optimize @tailrec annotated method usesArgAtMostOnce: it contains a recursive call not in tail position
[error]         occurrences.length == 1
[error]                            ^
[error] one error found
{code}
When I remove the polymorphic recursion, that code is accepted, hence the warning is as wrong as it seems. If I comment out that code location and simply return 'false' there, I get instead:
{code}

[error] /Users/pgiarrusso/Documents/Research/Sorgenti/linqonsteroids/src/main/scala/ivm/optimization/Optimization.scala:537: could not optimize @tailrec annotated method usesArgAtMostOnce: it is called recursively with different type arguments
[error]         usesArgAtMostOnce(g, v)
[error]         ^
[error] one error found
{code}
The errors are from 2.9.2, I got essentially the same behavior from 2.9.1.

*Polymorphic tail-recursion should be easy to optimize. This optimization should happen after erasure, where type parameters are irrelevant; they can only become relevant through implicit parameters, but they can be treated equally to other parameters, so not even this case is a problem.
I'm not sure whether there would be a problem before erasure, except that one would need to modify type arguments. But at least _defining_ tail recursion in F-omega-sub (F^omega_<: ) doesn't seem to be any different from a system without polymorphism (STLC or lambda_<: ).
