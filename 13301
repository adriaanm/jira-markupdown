The following syntax is not accepted by scalac:
```scala
for {
  n <- Some(42)
  _ <- Some(24)
} yield n
```

Instead of `_ <- Some(24)` you must write `val _ <- Some(24)` (the old for-syntax) to make scalac accept it. However it is possible to write this:
```scala
  for ( n <- Some(42); _ <- Some(24) ) yield n
```
