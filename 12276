On closer inspection this is a known issue where the target member of the link is not highlighted on arrival at the page. {{shouldRethrow}} is present further down the page but this is not clear without the visual cue.

The momentary disclosure of documentation on the page with the link when the link is clicked is a separate issue. Having said that the initial report in Jira is a fair account of what an occasional viewer could think happened.ï»¿ Because of this I have edited this issue to detail the lesser issue of page navigation actions also initiating documentation expansions.
