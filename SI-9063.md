I posted this on the "issues" section of the github page, but I have a feeling that's the wrong place, so I'm reposting here.

Hi all,
I've seen personally that people struggle with Twitter's `com.twitter.util.Future#handle` (AFAICT `scala.concurrent.Future#recover`) vs `com.twitter.util.Future#rescue` (analogous to `scala.concurrent.Future#recoverWith`). I recommended that we internally (in Twitter) switch to the names handle and `flatHandle`, so that it would be obvious which one flattens, and so that the analogy to map and `flatMap` was more obvious. It came up that this would possibly be a good place to follow the `scala.concurrent.Future` naming conventions, but when I saw what the names were, I thought maybe they could use a renaming as well.
1. Am I off-base with this analysis?
2. Would you support a renaming?
Thanks!
Max
Another alternative would be to have a separate type "inside" Future, like "Except", and then 
- There is a method to convert a Future to an Except
- There are map and flatmap methods on Except that act exactly as recover and recoverWith. (Then we get for comprehensions, too!)
