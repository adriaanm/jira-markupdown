Scala class:
{code}
package test

class Visibility {
    private[this] val thisPriv = 0
    private val priv = 1
    protected val prot = 2
    private[test] val packPriv = 3
    protected[test] val packProt = 4
}

javap result:

public class test.Visibility extends java.lang.Object implements scala.ScalaObject{
    public volatile int bitmap$$0;
    private final int packProt;
    private final int packPriv;
    private final int prot;
    private final int priv;
    private final int thisPriv;
    public test.Visibility();
    public int packProt();
    public int packPriv();
    public int prot();
    private int priv();
}
{code}
It would be nice, and more correct, to have the following three be tighter:
{code}
    protected int packProt();
    int packPriv();
    protected int prot();
{code}
This is a duplicate of SI-4035. The reason why we haven't yet fixed it is because protected is hard to combine when you are dealing for example with self-types. And for other cases we need accessors to be generated which is also non trivial in this case.
To be precise code generator currently only issues private or public access modifiers.
