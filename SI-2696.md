See Example 3.2.5
This code won't compile with strange message:
```scala
class Ref[T]
abstract class Outer {type T}
trait D {
  val x: Ref[x.T] forSome {val x: Outer}
  val y: Ref[x_type # T] forSome {type x_type <: Outer with Singleton} = x
}
```
I guess this is mostly a documentation issue (afaict, Singleton's special status is only indirectly explained in the desugaring of existential values). Then again, shouldn't `Nothing <: Singleton`?

```scala
