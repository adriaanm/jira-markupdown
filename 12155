The SO article pointed to is irrelevant to this issue–that user doesn't know what language feature they're using, and he didn't understand the terminology on the (correct) Scaladoc page either. His trouble wasn't that he couldn't _find_ the documentation because he didn't completely read the warning message. This bug report claims that this sentence: "See the Scala docs for value scala.language.reflectiveCalls for a discussion" is not enough to know that reflectiveCalls is a value member of scala.language, which I disagree with.

Furthermore, you make the point that you just want to search "reflectiveCalls" and ignore the path. I don't think it's a wise way to use Scala or Java to totally ignore paths when trying to debug code. 

RE: A.P Marki – I don't think this is an issue of tooling. This is simply an issue of someone overlooking the word "value" in the explicit instructions in the warning. This is a bug report that seems to request that we change our warnings so that people don't have to think about paths, which is not the right thing to do in my opinion.
