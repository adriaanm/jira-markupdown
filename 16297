In 2.9.0.1:

{code}
scala> List(1) ++ List('a')
res0: List[AnyVal] = List(1, a)
{code}

In 2.9.1RC1/2.10-trunk:

{code}
scala> List(1) ++ List('a')
res0: List[AnyVal{def getClass(): java.lang.Class[_ >: Int with Char <: AnyVal]}] = List(1, a)
{code}

I'm not sure if this is a bug or an enhancement.

Imho the type signature is exposing some implementation detail of getCLass for AnyVals (probably related to SI-864) and shouldn't appear anywhere.

I really don't want to explain that type signature to a beginner ...
