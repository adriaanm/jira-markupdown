I am happy to say that I thought of this case when implementing ##...
{code}
  // Intercept super.## and translate it to this.##
  // which is fine since it's final.
  case Select(sup @ Super(_, _), nme.HASHHASH)  =>
    Select(gen.mkAttributedThis(sup.symbol), Object_##) setType IntClass.tpe
{code}
...and sorry to say it didn't occur to me that previously existing code might need the same handling.  Makes the fix easy enough.
