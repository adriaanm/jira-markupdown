Java:
```scala
public class AO {
    public static <T> void f(T[] a) {
        System.out.println(ar0);
    }
}
```

Scala:
```scala
object Main {
    def main(argv : Array[String]) : Unit = {
        val a = Array(1, 2, 3)
        AO.f(a)
    }
}
```

This tries to cast `a` to `Object[]`, which will always fail. It should give a compile-time error, since Java doesn't support polymorphic use of primitive arrays.
