Generated Scaladoc documentation is missing the following in "Value Summary" and "Value Details":
 1. Primary constructor arguments that are explicitly or implicitly val - p and s below
 2. User-supplied documentation for lazy val members - t below
 3. Mentioning "lazy val" instead of "val" for lazy val members - t below


{code}
/**
 * Simple class
 * @param p - val argument to primary constructor
 * @param q - ordinary argument to primary constructor
 */
class A(val p: Int, q: Int) {
    /**
     * Ordinary val
     */
    val r: Int = 0
}

/**
 * Case class
 * @param s - implicitly a val as B is a case class
 */
case class B(s: Int) {
    /**
     * Lazy val. This means it is evaluated when first accessed.
     */
    lazy val t: Int = 0
}
{code}

(In r22739) [Scaladoc] Improve the documentation of primary constructor. 
Adds a @constructor for commenting the primary constructor. It also adds some comments for the primary constructor (@params, @deprecated) which are initialised in the class comment. Members that come from primary constructor parameters (val parameters or parameters of a case class) are listed as members with the comment given using the @param tag (closes SI-254, closes SI-577).
Case class signature now begins by 'case class' instead of 'class'.
Review by dubochet
Please note that issue number 2 above (User-supplied documentation for lazy val members) is not solved in Scala 2.8.1 RC3. There's a separate ticket for this: SI-3790.
