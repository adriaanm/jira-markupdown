Using 2.6.0-final I get the following issue:

In Java:

package test;

public class Outer{
  public class Inner{

  }
}


If I then try to use this as follows from Scala:

package test2;

import test.Outer;

class Foo extends Outer{
  val bar = new Inner(); // Shouldn't this work?
}

scalac complains that Inner is being called with the wrong number of constructor arguments. I need to write:

class Foo extends Outer{
  val bar = new Inner(this); // This *does* work
}

If I replace the bit of Java code with a Scala equivalent it works fine. 
This was never properly implemented. The existing code simply creates aliases for the {{Outer$$Inner}} class in the outer class, so they can be easily accessed. This works fine for static (nested) classes, but fails for proper inner classes. I don't think it's too difficult to implement this, but there are some issues with circular dependencies. I'm not sure it will go in 2.6.2, though.
