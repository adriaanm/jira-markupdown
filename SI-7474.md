"What's wrong with an API which non-deterministically returns either {{A}} or {{B(Set(A, ...))}}?"

... which seems pretty much what the exception handling behavior of the parallel collections does.

If exceptions of type {{A}} occur, either an exception of type {{A}} or an exception of type {{B}}, wrapping multiple exceptions of {{A}}'s, is observed.
Imho, this behavior is incredibly broken and so unintuitive, that even people writing tests don't handle it correctly. See `files/run/t5375.scala`.

Concerning “non-deterministic”:
How many exceptions are observed before the operation is aborted depends on the machine, the available cores and hyper-threading, the operating system, the threadpool implementation and configuration, the size of the collection and the runtime itself.

In fact, `files/run/t5375.scala` is failing on both jdk7u and Avian because of this issue.

After thinking about this, I propose just throwing the "first" exception which occurs.
This seems to be what C# and Java both do, too.

Even consistently returning `CompositeThrowable` doesn't make much sense (because we have fail-fast behaviour and don't wait until all tasks have finished or have thrown an exception).
Therefore, there is no useful semantic in having a `CompositeThrowable` which returns "some" exceptions. Either we gather and return all the exceptions or we just return one, instead of wrapping a non-deterministic number of exceptions into a completely unrelated wrapper type.

Considering that changing the parallel collection semantics in such a profound way is out of question, I propose the second option.

As soon as we are targeting Java > 7 we can use `addSurpressed` to add further exceptions which also occurred.
