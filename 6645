This sequence went "true, true, false" when this ticket was opened. Now it goes "true, true, true". Unfortunately it's supposed to go "true, false, false". So the bug has moved - it is no longer that unused bindings are stripped, but that they don't appear to be considered at all, at least not based on this example. I know that scala/bug#1503 remains unfixed so it's not like they were being adequately considered before either.
```scala
scala> val s: Seq[Nothing] = Vector.empty
s: Seq[Nothing] = Vector()

scala> s match { case Nil => true ; case _ => false }
res0: Boolean = true

scala> s match { case x@Nil => true ; case _ => false }
res1: Boolean = true

scala> s match { case x@Nil => {x; true} ; case _ => false }
<console>:9: warning: a pure expression does nothing in statement position; you may be omitting necessary parentheses
              s match { case x@Nil => {x; true} ; case _ => false }
                                       ^
res2: Boolean = true
```
