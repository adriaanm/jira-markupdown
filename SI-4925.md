{code:title=A.scala}
class A {
  final class Inner {
    @inline def foo = 7
  }
  def inner = new Inner 
}
{code}
{code:title=B.scala}
class B {
  def baz = {
    val a = new A
    val o = a.inner
    val z = o.foo
    println(z)
  }
}
{code}
Compile with:
{code}
$ scalac A.scala
$ scalac -optimize B.scala
B.scala:8: warning: Could not inline required method foo because bytecode was not available.
    val z = o.foo
              ^
one warning found
{code}
Expected behavior would be to inline {{foo}}, as correctly happens when both files are compiled together.

Likely cause:

{{ICodeReader}} overrides {{ClassfileParser.classNameToSymbol}} but does not replicate the logic that deals with inner classes (i.e. try {{innerClasses.get(name)}} object before trying {{definitions.getClass(name)}})
Surprisingly, this bug seems to be a mirage.  It's only due to their being in the empty package, and whether bug or not, empty package classes aren't visible through definitions.getClass.  If I put them both in the same package there's no warning and I can see it inlined:
{code}
public void baz();
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=1
   0:	new	#7; //class bip/A
   3:	dup
   4:	invokespecial	#11; //Method bip/A."<init>":()V
   7:	astore_1
   8:	aload_1
   9:	invokevirtual	#15; //Method bip/A.inner:()Lbip/A$Inner;
   12:	pop
   13:	getstatic	#21; //Field scala/Predef$.MODULE$:Lscala/Predef$;
   16:	bipush	7
   18:	invokestatic	#27; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
   21:	invokevirtual	#31; //Method scala/Predef$.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
   24:	return
{code}
So I'm closing this, but if there is still an issue which is being obscured by the empty package thing let me know.
Oh I see, you were right that it's that override, because the superclass has logic to deal specifically with this:

      if (name.pos('.') == name.length)
        definitions.getMember(definitions.EmptyPackageClass, name.toTypeName)
      else
        definitions.getClass(name) // see tickets #2464, #3756
