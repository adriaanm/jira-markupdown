Looks like a few bits were twiddled between the original bug and this report. Sorry for the noise. Must have been a strong set of solar flares that day.

Here's a CCE. We should check that `isEmpty` returns boolean.
```scala
class Casey(a: Int) { def isEmpty = this; def get = this }
object Casey { def unapply(a: Casey) = a }
 
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val Casey(x) = new Casey(1)
  }
}
```
```
 (export V=v2.11.0-M5 && scalac-hash $V sandbox/test.scala && scala-hash $V Test)
sandbox/test.scala:7: warning: Casey and Int are unrelated: they will most likely never compare equal
    assert(x == 1, x)
             ^
one warning found
java.lang.ClassCastException: Casey cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean

(export V=origin/master && scalac-hash $V sandbox/test.scala && scala-hash $V Test)
