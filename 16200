I was trying to invoke a constructor of a class MLNFactorGraph that is protected[MLNFactorGraph]. The compiler gave the following error:
```scala
error: type mismatch;
found   : scala.runtime.StringAdd
required: edu.uulm.scbayes.mln.MLNFactorGraph
val sliceGraph: MLNFactorGraph = new MLNFactorGraph(
```

for the following code snippet:
```scala
    val sliceGraph: MLNFactorGraph = new MLNFactorGraph(
      newGraph.gpMap,
      newGraph.fgpMap,
      newFactors,
      (newNodes ++ newFactors.flatMap(_.variables)).toSet.toSeq, //take all new variables and all variables that are adjacent to a used factor
      newSignature
    )
```

The file compiles when I comment out this section. The file compiles also, when I make the constructor of MLNFactorGraph public.

The involved files reside in different packages.

I was not able to reproduce this bug in a synthetic example.
