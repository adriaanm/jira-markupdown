It is deterministic - every time I run a full test suite one test fail on this.The test itself compiles some code using toolbox, in this case call to generic Java method:
```scala
public <T> T genericMethod(T x) {
  return x;
}
```

I'll try to debug the cause of this later, it have to be some corrupted state in Toolbox, as running this test alone works fine.
