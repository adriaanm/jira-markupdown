This is a terrible example of using Lower Bounds but it does reveal a behaviour that seemed unexpected.

```scala
trait Animal
case class Foo()
case class Cage[A >: Animal](animal: A)
val cage = Cage(Foo())
```

In this example, I would expect that that the compiler would infer:

{code: scala}
cage: Cage[AnyRef] = Cage(Foo())
```scala

But the compiler actually infers:

{code: scala}
cage: Cage[Object] = Cage(Foo())
```
With a bit more investigation, we have learned that this seems to not be limited to Lower Bounds situations.

```scala
scala> new AnyRef
res3: Object = java.lang.Object@33f8bccc
```
Think of AnyRef as an alias for Object:


```scala
scala> type Foo = String
defined type alias Foo

scala> new Foo
res0: String = ""

scala> :power

scala> val x = symbolOf[AnyRef]
x: $r.intp.global.TypeSymbol = type AnyRef

scala> x.isAliasType
res6: Boolean = true

scala> x.tpe.dealias
res7: $r.intp.global.Type = Object
```

Assuming that you didn't find any case where something compiled with AnyRef, but was rejected when using Object (or the other way around), I'd say that this isn't a bug.

I guess the main question is: Should we prefer displaying AnyRef over Object? Always, or are there any exceptions?
