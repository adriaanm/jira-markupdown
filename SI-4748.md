I would expect

>Range(1,30).init
scala.collection.immutable.Range = Range(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)

Instead I get
scala.collection.immutable.Range = Range(1)

This works:
Range(1,30).toList.init
List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 1
8, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)
(extempore in [r25209](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25209)) Fix for unfortunate bug in Range.init.  Closes #4748, no review.
