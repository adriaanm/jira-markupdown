This relatively small test case blows up during "lambdalift":

```scala
trait Foo[@specialized(Int) A] {
  final def bar(a:A):A = bar(a)
}
```

There are a lot of variants that **do** compile properly. By removing specialized, or final, you can get code that compiles. Of course, this code will just overflow the stack, but the bug seems to affect any recursive final method, not just pointless ones.

I ran into this issue when trying to update https://github.com/non/spire to work with 2.10.0.

I've attached a test source file and the error log.
I was about to ask you about that; I only noticed it after discovering -uniqid...  I thought Adriaan's comment had special significance, like LabelDefs are used differently now; but it was clear how this used to work in 2.9.  Obviously, after learning what Typer is doing for Duplicator, I could answer my questions from yesterday; but I had to stick treeBrowser.browse in a few places to get the picture.  For future newbies, one might think of Duplicator.retyped as .reduplicate as opposed to tree.duplicate.

I'll be curious to see the rest of the fix if there's more; you don't just get the enclosing context?  Sorry I didn't get it done. :)
Unfortunately it's not in M4 but it'll be there in 2.10. I fixed the main issue, but there's a widening transformation happening and I haven't been able to prevent it so far. In case you want to take a look, my last progress is at [https://github.com/VladUreche/scala/tree/issue/5788]. The main commit that explains what I do is [https://github.com/VladUreche/scala/commit/101c4385568b3c762306277d8a2bd14171b4451f].

It won't compile the following case, complaining it's expecting `Test.this.B[T]` and it got `<empty>.This#B[T]`:
```scala
trait Test {
  trait B[T]
  private final def grow[T](): B[T] = grow[T]()
}
```
Status update: I prepared the pull request but there is a problem in the backend: the closure elimination phase incorrectly eliminates some code and this leads to a failed test: 

```scala
$ cat test/files/run/tailcalls-base2.scala 
// This test checks correct handling of the this pointer in the tailcalls transformation
trait Base {
  def message: String
  class T(i: Int) { println(message) ; def msg = message }

  @annotation.tailrec final /* make sure it's transformed by tailcalls */
  def tailCall(a:Int, other: Base): T =
    if (a == 0) 
      new T(0)
    else 
      other.tailCall(a-1, this) // tail call-transformed
}

class ReturnsInt extends Base { def message = this.getClass.toString }
class ReturnsStr extends Base { def message = this.getClass.toString }

object Test extends App {
  val rInt = new ReturnsInt
  val rStr = new ReturnsStr

  for (x <- 1 to 10)
    println(rInt.tailCall(x, rStr).msg)
}
