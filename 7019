I've looked at the bytecode emitted with and without `-optimize`, for each of the scenarios below:
- `Test` is a `case class`
  {{Test(42)}} 
  Outcome: doesn't invoke the companion object's constructor
- `Test` is a non-case `class`
  {{new Test(42)}} 
  Outcome: doesn't invoke the companion object's constructor

Now, let's turn this around. Instead of having me show the above is per-spec, can you provide a counter-argument? Which place in the spec mentions the above should behave differently?
