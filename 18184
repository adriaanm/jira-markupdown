I can't for the life of me understand where/how these messages are getting made like that, but there are many tests that rely on this formatting.

In t6040.check, for example, you'll find:
```
error: extension of type scala.Dynamic needs to be enabled
by making the implicit value language.dynamics visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import language.dynamics'
or by setting the compiler option -language:dynamics.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.dynamics for a discussion
why the feature needs to be explicitly enabled.
one error found
```

Line breaks in messages mess with many build systems and generally it doesn't seem like a presentation-level detail like terminal width should have much bearing on compiler output.
