Order is lost
{code}
  TreeMap(1 -> new File("."), 2 -> new File("."),3 -> new File("."),4 -> new File("."),10 -> new File(".")).zipWithIndex
{code} 

Order is correct
{code}
  TreeMap(1 -> ".", 2 -> ".",3 -> ".",4 -> ".", 10 -> ".").zipWithIndex
{code} 

Scala doc says:
"...A new immutable tree map containing pairs consisting of all elements of this immutable tree map paired with their index. Indices start at 0. @example List("a", "b", "c").zipWithIndex = List(("a", 0), ("b", 1), ("c", 2))..."

It indicates that TreeMap is returned. Additionally, example is given for a List and should be for a Map.


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1final
  - Java: 1.6.0_23
  - Operating system: Windows 7 
This has been fixed in trunk. Since `File` is `Comparable` a low priority ordering implicit gets picked to provide an `Ordering` for a `Comparable` object. The correct builder factory found in the `TreeMap` companion (which takes the `Ordering` implicit parameter) is then picked, and a `TreeMap` is produced:

{code}
scala> TreeMap(1 -> new File("."), 2 -> new File("."), 3 -> new File("."), 4 -> new File("."), 10 -> new File(".")).zipWithIndex
res10: scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap[(Int, java.io.File),Int] = Map((1,.) -> 0, (2,.) -> 1, (3,.) -> 2, (4,.) -> 3, (10,.) -> 4)
{code}
