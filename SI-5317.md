It seems there is a serious regression of lub between 2.9 and 2.10, which leads to illogical types.
Here is one scenario which works:
```repl
scala> trait S { type T }
defined trait S

scala> trait A extends S { type T <: A }
defined trait A

scala> trait B extends S { type T <: B }
defined trait B

scala> val a = new A{}
a: Object with A = $anon$1@edfd5b8

scala> val b = new B{}
b: Object with B = $anon$1@68d88d5

scala> val x = if (true) a else b
x: S{type T <: S} = $anon$1@edfd5b8
```
This one looks good. Now, add a field x to types S, A, B:
```repl
scala> trait S { type T; val x: AnyRef }
defined trait S

scala> trait A extends S { type T <: A; val x: A = null }
defined trait A

scala> trait B extends S { type T <: B; val x: B = null }
defined trait B

scala> val a = new A{}
a: Object with A = $anon$1@370410a7

scala> val b = new B{}
b: Object with B = $anon$1@2a3fa87a

scala> val x = if (true) a else b
x: ScalaObject with S = $anon$1@370410a7
```
I would have expected to see `S { type T <: S; val x: S ` as the type but instead I get `ScalaObject with S`. 
Note this is a regression from 2.9.1, where I get ` ScalaObject with S{val x: ScalaObject with S; type T <: ScalaObject with S} `.

Since this affects fundamental type operations I classify a solution as critical for 2.10.

Eugene recently opened this as #5302.  See my comment there; this will be easy to fix one way or another, I only need to understand why/how this situation arises:

  type C = lub(A, B)
  !(A <:< C)

Doesn't the definition of "lub" require that to be true? Both that ticket and this one lead to situations where it isn't.
That's slipperier than I'd thought.  Since there's a good chance that even if I come up with something it will not be quite what you want, I will table this for an opinion.

The long and the short of it is that a subtype test is done with a nullary method type on the left and a refinement on the right.  The nullary result type is a subtype of the refined type, but the nullary method itself is not.  Poking around I tried letting those through; then the lub is correctly calculated and everything looks good for a while, until cleanup when it crashes here:
```scala

          val t: Tree = ad.symbol.tpe match {
            case MethodType(mparams, resType) =>
              assert(params.length == mparams.length)
              typedPos {
                val sym = currentOwner.newValue(ad.pos, mkTerm("qual")) setInfo qual0.tpe
                qual = safeREF(sym)

                BLOCK(
                  VAL(sym) === qual0,
                  callAsReflective(mparams map (_.tpe), resType)
                )
              }
          }
```
With a match error because a TypeRef turns up.  In case that's interesting.
