The function literal is inferred to existential type {code} C => $anon forSome { type $anon <: c.T; val c: C } {code}, which looks complex, but it is no more special than simple {{C => C#T}}.

Could you infer the function literal to {code} (C => C#T) with { def apply(c: C): c.T } {code}

The type of a a function literal is always of the form: `FunctionN[A, B]`

In your example `B` is an existential type.

Scala doesn't support dependent function types. There is a feature request for this in SI-4751. I will merge this ticket with that one, by adding your example to the comments of that ticket.
Section 6.3 of the spec explains how anonymous functions are type checked:

{quote}
The type of the anonymous function is scala.Functionn[S1, ..., Sn, T ], where T is the packed type (ยง6.1) of e. T must be equivalent to a type which does not refer to any of the formal parameters xi .
{quote}

The expansion to an anonymous subclass of {{FunctionN}} is only mentioned as the evaluation model:

{quote}
The anonymous function is evaluated as the instance creation expression
new scala.Functionn[T1, ..., Tn, T] { def apply(x1: T1,...,xn: Tn): T = e
}
{quote}
