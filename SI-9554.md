scala.concurrent.Future is not completed and onFailure is not called on every case when attached example code is executed. When normal exceptions and "new Error()" is thrown it works as documented, but runs to timeout when OOM / IntEx is thrown. Document clearly states that on IntEx ExectutionException should be the result (and OOM is subclass of Error)


scala.concurrent.Future onFailure document says: 

 The future may contain a throwable object and this means that the future failed. Futures obtained through combinators have the same exception as the future they were obtained from. The following throwable objects are not contained in the future:

    Error - errors are not contained within futures
    InterruptedException - not contained within futures
    all scala.util.control.ControlThrowable except NonLocalReturnControl - not contained within futures

Instead, the future is completed with a ExecutionException with one of the exceptions above as the cause. If a future is failed with a scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnControl, it is completed with a value from that throwable instead.
