r12003 added it to the CLDC port with this comment:
```scala
+  // this is only for use by immutable.Hash{Set,Map} and
+  // the imprecision is hopefully tolerable
+  def sqrt(x: Int): Int = x / 4
```
I don't even have the words to describe how horrifying that is.  I'm sure there was some rationale for putting such a thing in scala.Math and not in, oh, say, immutable.PleaseGodDontUseThisAnyone.

The fact that the Int => Int sqrt in the mainline appeared in the same commit makes me ultra-suspicious it is necessary.
