Actors are now 'starving' in certain scenarios and not continuing to run as expected.

 It appears that only a certain number of threads are started for use by Actors, and once all of those threads are 'locked up', no more will be created, even if other Actors exist that aren't being blocked/locked up.  

This didn't appear to be the case in 2.7, or perhaps the threadpool was much larger.

FYI, I posted this issue to the mailing list, and Phillip Haller doesn't believe this is a bug, he believes its correct behavior.  Here is a previous thread regarding the issue.  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/28381/

I still think that the default thread pool should grow, as I believe "correct" behavior should trump performance for the default, and only with configuration should you be able to sacrifice correctness for performance.  

Only if you block on a call to `Actor.receive` does the underlying thread pool resize itself. For arbitrary blocking operations there is no guarantee that the thread pool can provide progress.

Therefore, I'm closing the ticket.
