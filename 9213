Note that this opportunity is strongly linked to scala/bug#785, because at present only "objects" are privileged in the pattern matcher such that "case B1" is equivalent to type matching on B1.type. The val-defined instances of B1, B2, B3, despite having singleton types, are treated as arbitrary values upon which equals will be called and about which nothing is known. This needlessly eliminates the possibility of having a fully functional enumerated type which requires only one class definition.
