I can verify this happens with 2.8.0.r21649-b20100422035237 as well.

The same action fails if the class is fully qualified as well, i.e. running Organise Imports (Ctrl + Shift + O) or Add Import (Ctrl + Shift + M) on the following
{code}
var pattern: java.util.regex.Pattern;
{code}
results in the same error.
