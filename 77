While this has been compared to scala/bug#900, I don't think they are really about the same issue. I see this much in the same way as match statement error to the effect the match is impossible.

The semantics I'd personally like to see is: if the inferred/ascribed type cannot satisfy the pre-erasure type of pattern match statements (valid for val, for and match), return an error.

Just to compare and combine with scala/bug#900, these are things I'd expect:

for (i: Int <- List('symbol, "string", true)) yield i // compiles
for (i: Int <- List(false, true, false)) yield i // error
