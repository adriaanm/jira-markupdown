The situation has nothing to do with parameters. 

When you put a tree in name position of a val it becomes a pattern definition. And in this particular case is mishandled (which might be a bug):
{code}
scala> val x = q"x"
x: reflect.runtime.universe.Ident = x

scala> q"val $x: ${typeOf[Int]} = 2"
res0: reflect.runtime.universe.Tree =
{
  val x = 2;
  ()
}
{code}
