Jason:
As far as I can tell, yes, the fix should work.

The ` :+ ` and ` +: ` methods must return a collection of type `That`, where `That` comes from the `CanBuildFrom` object.
Since the `ReusableCBF` that comes from the `Seq` companion must has `Seq[A]` for `That`, and because:

- the default implementation of `:+` will return statically `Seq[A]`
- and anyway a `Vector` at runtime

It should be perfectly fine to use `eq`, which returns a `Vector` as an optimization.

Note to bug reporters, though - as Jason suggests, you should really use a `VectorBuilder` if you care about performance. And if you really, really care about append performance, use an `ArrayBuffer`, or better yet, a Conc-tree buffer from an external library (published through Sonatype):
