The scaladoc of enumerations only appear as "Value" and in the hover just show scala.Enumeration.Value and not the actual enumeration class.  For this to be useful, it needs to show the specific enumeration object.

Examples:

scala.swing.ScrollBar has 'def orientation: Value' and users must guess about which enumeration is required.  Should have a link to ScrollBar.Orientation in the docs.  Compare this to how JavaDoc provides direct links to the specific enums:  http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JList.html#setDropMode%28javax.swing.DropMode%29
An example in the interpreter shows that the compiler generates the correct type for inner classes in the outer object:

{code}
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

class Enum {
  abstract class Value
  class Val extends Value
  def Value(): Value = new Val
}

object Constants extends Enum {
  val a = Value
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Enum
defined module Constants

scala> Constants.a
res23: Constants.Value = Enum$Val@d5454d
{code}

While the generated Scaladoc reference the parent class, ignoring the outer object of the inner class:
{code}
val a: Enum.Value
{code}
Anyway, now it's fixed in trunk, take [BoxPanel's constructor|http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.swing.BoxPanel@<init>:BoxPanel] for example.
