We've got the same problem now with 2.9.0 in a case where only traits are involved but with multiple a self-type like this:

{code}
trait A
trait B
trait C { self: A with B =>

}
{code}

My brief tests with the Scala 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT from 17.5. shows that this case seems to be fixed with the last commit as well but maybe you want to add another test-case for this case anyways.
