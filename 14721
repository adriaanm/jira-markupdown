This won't compile:
```scala
object A {
  class G extends H
  class H
  class U extends G

  def foo(h: G) = 55
  def foo[T](h: T) = 66

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val x = foo(new U)
    println("x = " + x)
    Array("", "")
  }
}
```
but it's ok:
```scala
object A {
  class G extends H
  class H
  class U extends G

  def foo(h: G) = 55
  def foo[T](h: T) = 66

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val x = foo(new U)
    println("x = " + x)
    val a = Array("", "")
  }
}
```
In both cases expected type is undefined. So I can't see defference.
