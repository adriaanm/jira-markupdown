In issue 2819 I suggested the addition of a new type:

```scala
type =>?[-A, +B] = PartialFunction[A, B]
```

so that partial functions could be defined with a syntax similar to regular functions.

The change was made (thanks!), and I've been using it.  But I've noticed that it works a little differently from => because it's left-associative while => is right-associative.  So

```scala
Int => Int => Int
```

is a function that takes an Int and returns an Int => Int, while

```scala
Int =>? Int =>? Int
```

is a partial function that takes an Int =>? Int and returns an Int.

Obviously developers can easily make the second example work like the first by adding some parentheses, but this is counterintuitive for someone who has learned that =>? is like => but defines a partial function.

Some possible resolutions:

1. Ignore the issue entirely.

2. Make the operator "=>:" or "=>?:".  Undesirable because the "?" is descriptive of a partial function and "=>?:" is just plain ugly.

3. Have the compiler recognize =>? and treat it like =>.  My favorite option.  :-)  Probably somewhere in the compiler the parser recognizes "A => B" and transforms it into FunctionN[A, B]. This would be an extension of that logic.  It would also be a first step toward harmonizing the treatment of full and partial functions.
I think we need to take a step back here. Suddenly =>? is much less attractive than 
it seemed at first glance. In fact the irregularity makes one doubt whether in its current version we should have it at all!

I think we should refrain from making it work with a quick hack. These hacks always have a high long-term cost in terms of language complexity. So, let's back out now, and think whether at some point we can come up with a more general solution to the problem, or whether maybe we come to the conclusion that the problem is not worth solving.


One more explanation: Since RC7 will be the 2.8 beta (barring unforeseen vetos), our best option is to make one tiny change to RC7 which is to declare =>? as deprecated. It will then be removed in 2.8 proper, unless we come up with a convincing fix to the problem.
(In r20466) Deprecated "=>?". Closes #2860 (see #2819).
