Consider the following case:

```scala
   class Foo(f : => Unit){
      lazy val bar = f;
   }
```

Once bar has been evaluated, f is no longer needed, but instances of Foo will retain a reference to it anyway (and anything it in turn has captured), potentially preventing all sorts of things from being garbage collected. This is bad, and will become particularly important once #240 is done and we have lazy parameters. 

It would be nice if the following was also handled correctly:

```scala
   class Foo(f : => Unit){
      lazy val bar = f;
      lazy val baz = f;
   }
```

But this is somewhat less important and handling the case of only one lazy val will probably capture most of the use cases. 
Sorry, #240 rathe than #204
