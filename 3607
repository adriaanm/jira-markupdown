the original patch addressed the mismatch between the list of type arguments (including dummy-Nothings) and the type params (where undetermined ones are dropped) by dropping both argument and parameter when they could not be determined (before, only the list of type parameters was pruned)

[the "dual" solution would be to stop dropping the parameter before doing the substitution (which implies undetermined parameters would get instantiated to themselves)]

undetermined type params are treated in two different ways:

1) they don't get instantiated: for undetermined type params, adjustTypeArgs returns the type that refers to the type parameter  so substitution is a no-op

NOTE: eventually they do get substituted --  but where?!

2) when checking the bounds, we should pretend undetermined type parameters have been instantiated to Nothing

scala/bug#3477 is concerned with the second case, which would be an improvement we should probably include in 2.8.1
