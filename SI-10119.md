I was confused by
`Array.tabulate(5,5)(_ => new AtomicInteger())`

Finally figured out I needed to do:
`Array.tabulate(5,5)((\_,\_) => new AtomicInteger())`
It ought to accept

```
(_*) => ???
```

to take as many underscores as expected.

Also, what a neat link to the ML days of the wild west. When you could just stake your claim to a new usage of underscore. The quickest draw won.
