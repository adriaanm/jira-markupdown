Assume I have two ant based project, the directorie trees are something like:
```scala
+lib.a
  + .scala_dependencies
  + src
  + build.xml

+lib.b
  + .scala_dependencies
  + src
  + build.xml
```
Where lib.b depends on lib.a, so, the build.xml of lib.b may contains "<ant antfile="@{lib.a}/build.xml .../>", that is, an ant call on lib.a's build.xml. When start an "ant build" under working directory "lib.b", and then the building process goes into lib.a's build.xml, the working directory will stay under "lib.b", which then will generate all src files under "lib.a/src" as relative paths from "lib.b", for example: "../../lib.a/src/A.scala". It's not satisfaction.

What I suggested is that the rootPath should be based on the location of ".scala_dependencies" instead of "./", the code is something like:
```scala
val rootPath = depFilePath.normalize.parent.get
```
This will solve a lot of pains for ant projects that have dependcencies between them.
I meant parent ****folder**** of depFilePath
But we cannot guarantee it, so should we write the code as:
```scala
val rootPath = depFilePath.parent getOrElse depFilePath.normalize.parent.get
```
For instance, given the following,
```scala
val p1 = Path(.scala_dependencies")
val p2 = p1.parent.map(_.resolve(p1.name))
```
It should be the case that p1 == p2 is true. That's not the case currently.

Nb. if Path.parent is fixed in the obvious why, then it should probably return a Path rather than an Option[Path].

Grr ... this time with the right formatting ;-)

For instance, given the following,

```scala
val p1 = Path(.scala_dependencies")
val p2 = p1.parent.map(_.resolve(p1.name))
```

It should be the case that p1 == p2 is true. That's not the case currently because p1.parent returns None.

Nb. if Path.parent is fixed in the obvious why, then it should probably return a Path rather than an Option[Path].

Current behavior of Path.parent is same as java.io.File, that is, it needs to call getAbsoluteFile.getParent in Java too, otherwise will return null:
```scala
scala> val a = new java.io.File("build.xml")
a: java.io.File = build.xml

scala> a.exists 
res1: Boolean = true

scala> a.getParent
res2: java.lang.String = null

scala> a.getAbsoluteFile.getParent
res3: java.lang.String = /Users/dcaoyuan/myprjs/aiotrade.hg/opensource/modules/lib.util
```
So, the equality behavior of Path is something like:

```scala
scala> val p1 = Path("build.xml")    
p1: scala.tools.nsc.io.Path = File(build.xml)

scala> p1.normalize.parent.map(_ resolve p1).get
res4: scala.tools.nsc.io.Path = Path(/Users/dcaoyuan/NetBeansProjects/ScalaAntTest/build.xml)

scala> p1.normalize.parent.map(_ resolve p1).get == p1
res5: Boolean = false

scala> p1.normalize.parent.map(_ resolve p1).get == p1.normalize
res13: Boolean = true

scala> p1.normalize.parent.get relativize p1.normalize 
res16: scala.tools.nsc.io.Path = File(build.xml)
```

Since the equality of Path is comparing path string, and "relativize" works properly between "p1.normalize.parent.get" and "p1.normalize". I think that's OK, 
Miles, if the change won't break your code, I'll commit it as a quick fix until we get a better solution.
