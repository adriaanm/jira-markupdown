Why this code compile and work?
{code}
object TestForResults extends App {
  var s = 0
  val a = for (i <- 1 to 10) { s } += i
  println(a)
  println(s)
}
{code}
Output will be:
{code}
()
55
{code}
Hi Thomas,

this should have been asked on the mailing list first, probably. 

Maybe it makes it a bit more clear, this code is equivalent:

{code}
  for (i <- 1 to 10) s += i
{code}

The `{}` is not doing what you expect.
I guess "why does this work" has some novelty value.  Yes, please don't open bugs without some evidence there is a bug.
