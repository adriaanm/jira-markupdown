revealed during Paul's resurrection of the tree checkers 

this fails to -Ycheck:typer

```scala
class A {
  class C[x]
  val cs = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[C[_], Int]
  def c: C[_] = error("")
  val eval: C[_] = c
  cs(c) += 1
}
```

the problem is the synthetic `val ev$$1: C[_$$2] = c` that's generated, where `C[_$$2]` is unpacked since it just reuses the type of the tree `c`.
(extempore in [r25225](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25225)) evalOnce needs to pack the type before using it on new valdefs
to avoid existential mismatches.  Closes #3960, review by moors.
