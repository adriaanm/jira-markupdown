@Ichoran  @szeiger Could I get your opinion on this?

I'm in favour of explicitly documenting the "don't mutate in the callback" restriction. Maybe this could be documented as a general note for mutable collections that results are undefined if they are mutated during queries or iteration.

But I'd be happy to revert to the current behaviour in the 2.12.x series to be conservative.
