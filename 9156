I agree that's what the sip says, but as you know I do not generally find such documents particularly relevant. If there's a better way to do things then it's a bug in the sip. I see zero utility in intentionally generating a call to a method which can be seen not to exist and in so doing making it impossible to reach the method which does exist.
