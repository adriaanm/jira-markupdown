There isn't a straightforward way to determine the success of a compilation resulting from a call to the addSourceFiles, removeFiles, or update methods in !RefinedBuildManager.

As mentioned in the email below, the motivation is to make automated testing of the build manager possible.  The easiest solution is probably to make those methods return a Boolean indicating success or failure.

!RefinedBuildManager has the information immediately available, it just currently discards it and then resets the reporter so it isn't available by manager.compiler.reporter.hasErrors.  The changes required to return a Boolean indicating success are trivial.

A custom Reporter would require subclassing Reporter.  This would require the test framework to be compiled against and run using the same version of Scala being tested, which is an unwarranted complexity.
