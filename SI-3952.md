It would be nice if the compiler could give a warning when method parameters are not used and suggest to use wildcard as parameter name instead.

For example, looking at this method:

def foo(a:Int, b:Int, c:Int):Int = a + b

one can hardly tell if it is a bug or not. Writing it like below would make the intent explicit:

def foo(a:Int, b:Int, _:Int):Int = a + b

Cheers!
There's the small matter that the underscore isn't legal syntax.  I do have a fairly complete private spotting plugin which I'll finish one of these days.  Going to call this a duplicate of SI-441.

Couldn't this syntax become legal? A plugin will do the job for unused vars but not for unused method parameters because there won't be a way to remove the warning condition.
