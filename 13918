The following Java source fails to compile:

import scala.None;

yielding the following error from javac (1.6.0_10 beta):

cannot access scala.None
bad class file: scala/None.class(scala:None.class)
undeclared type variable: A
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
import scala.None;
            ^

I am compiling against the scala-library.jar from Scala 2.7.2-final.

This looks related to SI-1454
