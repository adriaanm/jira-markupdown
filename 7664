SIP is at [the SIP page](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/improved-lazy-val-initialization.html) but I'm not sure what the status is.

It would be nice for the issue tracker to track SIPs for easy linking, maybe as a dedicated "Type" (SIP) or "Status" (Sipped).

The behavior is "not a bug" (because it's a feature or implementation detail) but also not "won't fix"; it's "out of scope" for an ordinary issue.
