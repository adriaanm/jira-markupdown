The issue is that your patch needed to merge the list of string into one:
```scala
def unparse = if(values.isEmpty) Nil 
              else name :: (value mkString " ") :: Nil
```

I went the less code route, assuming it still parses.   Like I said, I couldn't tell if we had automated tests, I just validated against scalatest and the ant build in that commit.   I think we should add some partest setting tests so we avoid breaking each other!
