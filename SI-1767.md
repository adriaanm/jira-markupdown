I am about to close a bunch of tickets related to the asserts in NewScanners which I changed in r17241 to regular parse errors: SI-822, SI-1674, SI-1682, and SI-1765.  I'm opening this ticket because some of those cases, now that they aren't crashers, receive a number of unhelpful error messages after the first.  I propose XML team investigate trimming the error reporting down to the last reasonably sensible message.
