The {{Ordering\[T\]}} trait and its friends {{Equiv\[T\]}} and {{PartialOrdering\[T\]}} should be contravariant in {{T}}.  This would for example allow {{SeqLike.sorted}} to be declared as:

{code}
def sorted(implicit ord: math.Ordering[A]): Repr
{code}

rather than

{code}
def sorted[B >: A](implicit ord: math.Ordering[B]): Repr
{code}

It would also provide a good didactic example of contravariance in the library!
