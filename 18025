The `Ordering\[T\]` trait and its friends `Equiv\[T\]` and `PartialOrdering\[T\]` should be contravariant in `T`.  This would for example allow `SeqLike.sorted` to be declared as:
```scala
def sorted(implicit ord: math.Ordering[A]): Repr
```

rather than
```scala
def sorted[B >: A](implicit ord: math.Ordering[B]): Repr
```

It would also provide a good didactic example of contravariance in the library!
