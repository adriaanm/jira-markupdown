Another area where @static will help is remove the SerialVersionUID annotation. Instead users will just write:
{code}
  @static private val serialVersionUID = 432525L
{code}

Writing it java is always an option... But having a module that has some files in Java and some in Scala sounds icky to me (esp. compilation of both).
