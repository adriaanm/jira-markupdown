If the solution would require dramatic changes in the Scala compiler which are
difficult to maintain then my vote is **to keep the Scala compiler clean**.
In this case the obfuscator  will find a solution for Scala. We do not need to 
change every java obfuscator in the world, we just need to use the one which is
able to work with Scala.
