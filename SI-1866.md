I've seen both SI-1349 and SI-1590 but I am using a very recent nightly update and I still have both problems.

*Run As menu*

When I go to the "right-click > Run As" menu the "JUnit Test" option does not appear.

*No JUnit tests found*

When I open a Scala file that contains a JUnit 4 test class and I execute the "Run As... Junit Test" action by pressing "Shift+Alt+X T" I get two different results depending on the carets position:
 1. If the caret is at a test method (annotated with org.junit.Test) name then the expected behaviour happens and the test method runs in the JUnit runner.
 2. If the caret is not at a test method name then I get "No JUnit tests found".The expected behaviour here is to run all the test methods (excluding those annotated with org.junit.Ignore).

The code used to test the bug:

{code}
package test4

import org.junit._

class SampleTest {

  @Test
  def alwaysFail {
    assert(false)
  }
  
  @Test
  def alwaysPass {
    assert(true)
  }
}
{code}

*Tested with*
 * Eclipse Version: 3.4.2 Build id: M20090211-1700
 * SDT version 2.8.0.r17471-b20090410021621
 * Update site: http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-nightly
 * SUN JDK 1.6
 * Ubuntu 9.04
Hi,

this approach does not work with my configuration. I still get the _No JUnit tests found_ message.
Another workaround is to add the RunWith annotation to the test class declaration:
{code}
import org.junit.runner.RunWith
import org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner

@RunWith(classOf[BlockJUnit4ClassRunner])
class TestClass {
  ...
{code}

Then Alt+Shift+X,T works. 
In 2.7.4 if I write the test methods with the parenthesis, the return type declaration (Unit) and the equals sign:

{code}
@Test
def alwaysFail(): Unit = {
  assert(false)
}
{code}

the tests are recognized most of the time. BTW I am still not able to select a source directory and execute all the tests in it.
Replying to [comment:6 spiros]:
> Junit integration works as expected when I use a version from the nightly update site. Feel free to close this issue.

Forgot to mention that I've tested this with Eclipse 3.5rc1.
