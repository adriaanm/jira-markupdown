+1 on eliding for Nothing.  I guess it would have been a high bar to introduce
{code}
def ??! : Nothing = throw new NoLongerImplementedError
{code}
into Predef.

And yet there is a certain symmetry:
{code}
def yagni = ???
def yagni = feature()
@deprecated("Useless","1.0") def yagni = feature()
@deprecated("Useless","1.0") def yagni = ??!
{code}
