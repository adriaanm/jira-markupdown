Jumping on this from scala/bug#9742. This is a pain point for docker, and my understanding is that changing the value of `-Xmax-classfile-name` isn't a usable solution because it requires everything on the class path to have been built with the same setting. I'd like to propose changing the default value to something that's safe everywhere. A quick google tells me that for ecryptfs you need source filenames to stay below 140 to be safe under encryption, so unless theres a reason not to, I'd propose going even lower than that for the default, like 128. That ensures that some bizarre ecryptfs under docker on aufs combination would still work fine.
