As per Eugene's Stackoverflow answer (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21273678/modulemirror-of-scala-object-defined-via-toolbox/21283078#21283078):

"I think it would be possible to change ToolBox.compile (a non-evaluating counterpart of eval) to special-case processing of top-level definitions, so that they not end up being compiled as local. Could you submit an issue to our issue tracker, so that we don't forget to fix it?"
