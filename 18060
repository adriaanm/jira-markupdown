The following tree gets an `OffsetPosition` for the parent when there's an inferred type parameter. This is a fairly common pattern in Lift, and prevents any useful operation on the super type (like hyperlinking).
```scala
class BadPos[A](a: A)
class GoodPos(a: AnyRef)

object sessionId extends BadPos(new Object)
object goodParent extends GoodPos(null)
```
The positions, reduced for readability:
```scala
48:91]object sessionId extends [65:91][73]BadPos[Object] {...
92:131]object goodParent extends [110:131][118:125]GoodPos {..
```

Notice that the `BadPos` tree has an offset position.
