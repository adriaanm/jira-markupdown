the poison line is:
{code}
Seq("") match { case Seq("") => ; case Seq(_, x) => println(x) }
{code}

here I demonstrate the problem in the repl, but it happens with the compiler and script runner too.
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r21803-b20100505020119 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_19).

substitute Array for Seq, same result. 2.8.0.RC1, same. 2.8.0.Beta1, crashes the compiler instead.

2.7 is OK.

It's a problem in the parallel matcher, maybe a duplicate. This is what arrives at the backend:

{code}

if (temp3.apply(0).==(""))  {
                      ()
}  else {
   body%1(x){
     scala.this.Predef.println(x)
  }
}
{code}

Notice that the else branch flows into a label without providing a value for the parameter. Paul, can you have a look at this? I think a crash is to be preferred instead to a VerifyError. The backend can't really detect if something has been assigned to `x' or not (at least not in the current architecture).
After a gazing a bit more through the pattern matcher, it occurs to me that the whole tree is wrong. It may not be that hard to fix though. Here's what I found. The (more complete) tree is:

{code}
var temp3: Seq = temp2.get().$$asInstanceOf[Seq]();
if (if (temp3.==(null))
  false
    else
      scala.Int.box(temp3.lengthCompare(1)).==(scala.Int.box(0)))
  {
    if (temp3.apply(0).==(""))
      {
        ()
      }
    else
      {
        body%1(x){
          scala.this.Predef.println(x)
        }
      }
  }
{code}

There are several things that look fishy with this code:
  * comparison on boxed integers in length check: `scala.Int.box(temp3.lengthCompare(1)).==(scala.Int.box(0)))`. This is most likely due to the code in lengthCheckOp, which resolves `==` to the AnyRef overload (I think).
  * the place where the label is defined should instead have a `throw MatchError`. Right now it flows into the label, and crashes because the parameter is not initialized, but even if it was, it wouldn't be correct: the seq has one element, so it can't println the second one.


(In r21923) Overhauled sequence length logic in the pattern matcher.  Removes
unnecessary boxing and a few varieties of wrongness.

Closes SI-3395, SI-3150, SI-2958, SI-2945, SI-2187.  No review.
