The eclipse plugin doesn't honour the spaces/tabs preferences as specified in the corresponding eclipse preference pane, namely whether spaces should be inserted instead of tabs.
The scala preference pane itself doesn't offer anything like it, so the plugin should adhere to the general preferences.
Which version of the plug-in you are using?

If I am correct this is a bug for 2.7x that has been fixed in 2.8.x (see bug: SI-1733).

After reading the related bug's comments, I do now realize that the Scala plugin obeys the JDT settings. Wish I had known that before :) As a matter of fact, since there is usually a corresponding preference pane associated with JDT, CDT, etc., I thought that since there is no such explicit preference pane for the Scala plugin, it would then obey Eclipse's general editor settings. After all, I think this is a bit of an unclear situation which should maybe highlighted in the documentation.
However, problem solved, the plugin nicely honours the JDT settings. Thanks for the hint!
