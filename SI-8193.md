It currently returns true in the following situations:
* For class primary constructors
* For trait mixin constructors
* For module class constructors
* For metadata-wise first java class constructors

Of those, only the first one actually makes sense wrt both the language spec and the public API. Thank goodness, package classes don't have constructors, or it would add insult to injury.
Also see https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8367 that made us revert the change to Java-defined classes targeted at fixing a part of this problem.
