This is from common modular build script where presence of scala is optional. So scala is resolved for every module and common init is not an option. Now fork="true" is a lifesaver.

Just checked sample at the different machine with:

Apache Ant version 1.7.0 compiled on December 13 2006
Scala code runner version 2.8.0.RC5 -- Copyright 2002-2010, LAMP/EPFL
java version "1.6.0_20"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.3-b01, mixed mode)

still OutOfMem.

What is your env?
