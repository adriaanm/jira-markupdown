When comparing TreeSets with default Set or HashSet when one contains Int and the other Long, the result is asymmetric.

scala> import scala.collection.immutable.TreeSet

// Comparing Set & HashSet is symmetric
scala> Set(1) == HashSet(1L)

// Comparing Set and TreeSet is asymmetric
scala> Set(1) == TreeSet(1L)

scala> TreeSet(1L) == Set(1)

// Comparing Set and HashSet is still symmetric with Int and Long switched
scala> Set(1L) == HashSet(1)
res4: Boolean = true

scala> HashSet(1) == Set(1L)
res5: Boolean = true

// Comparing Set and TreeSet is still asymmetric with Int and Long switched
scala> Set(1L) == TreeSet(1)
res6: Boolean = false

scala> TreeSet(1) == Set(1L)
res7: Boolean = true

// HashSet and TreeSet have the same asymmetry
scala> HashSet(1L) == TreeSet(1)
res8: Boolean = false

scala> TreeSet(1) == HashSet(1L)
res9: Boolean = true
```
```scala
scala> (Int.box(1)) == (Long.box(1L))
res5: Boolean = true

scala> Set[Int](1).asInstanceOf[Set[Long]].apply(1L)
res6: Boolean = true

scala> collection.immutable.TreeSet[Long](1L).subsetOf(Set[Int](1).asInstanceOf[Set[Long]])
res7: Boolean = true

scala> collection.immutable.TreeSet[Long](1L).equals(Set[Int](1))
res8: Boolean = true
```

Here's the nasty cast that leads us down the garden path:
```scala
trait GenSetLike {
 
  /** Compares this set with another object for equality.
   *
   *  '''Note:''' This operation contains an unchecked cast: if `that`
   *        is a set, it will assume with an unchecked cast
   *        that it has the same element type as this set.
   *        Any subsequent ClassCastException is treated as a `false` result.
   *  @param that the other object
   *  @return     `true` if `that` is a set which contains the same elements
   *              as this set.
   */
  override def equals(that: Any): Boolean = that match {
    case that: GenSet[_] =>
      (this eq that) ||
      (that canEqual this) &&
      (this.size == that.size) &&
      (try this subsetOf that.asInstanceOf[GenSet[A]]
       catch { case ex: ClassCastException => false })
    case _ =>
      false
  }
```

I'm not sure what to do about this one, but I'll assign to @Ichoran who is rarely short of good ideas!
This seems bad enough, before you start comparing different kinds of sets.
```scala
scala> Set(1) == Set(1L)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> TreeSet(1) == TreeSet(1L)
res1: Boolean = false
```
I may well be short on good ideas in this case.  We have the same problem with mutable.TreeSet, and mutable and immutable BitSet:

```scala
scala> Set(1) == i.TreeSet(1L)
res0: Boolean = false

scala> Set(1L) == i.BitSet(1)
res1: Boolean = false

scala> Set(1L) == m.BitSet(1)
res2: Boolean = false

scala> Set(1L) == m.TreeSet(1)
res3: Boolean = false

scala> m.TreeSet(1) == Set(1L)
res4: Boolean = true
```

The "solutions" I can think of so far are all of the ugly hacky variety.  For instance, in practice BitSet and TreeSet iterate in order.  So if you have two non-BT sets, the old method works (as no other sets, AFAIK, contain a math.Ordering or directly assume Int); if one is a BT set, then you call subsetOf in the other direction; and if both are they are ordered so you can compare in O(n) by iterating along both (and might want to special-case further).  But although this would work, it is hardly an attractive solution.
