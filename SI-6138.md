```scala

scala> def getClassSafe(fullName: String): Option[String] = try {
     |                Some(definitions.getClass(newTypeName(fullName)))
     |              } catch {
     |                case _: MissingRequirementError => None
     |              }
<console>:39: error: too many arguments for overloaded method value getClass with alternatives:


                      Some(definitions.getClass(newTypeName(fullName)))
                                               ^
```


note the cliff hanger, there -- no alternatives are reported

I think the problem is that the getClass symbol is overloaded, but the tree's type is already <error> by the time the error message is synthesized (the error arises from the erroroneous return type `Option[String]`)

Taking the relevant pieces of code:

```scala
if (sym.isOverloaded) overloadedMessage

def overloadedMessage = "overloaded method " + sym + " with alternatives:\n" + alternativesString(tree)

def alternativesString(tree: Tree) =
  alternatives(tree) map (x => "  " + methodTypeErrorString(x)) mkString ("", " <and>\n", "\n")

def alternatives(tree: Tree): List[Type] = tree.tpe match {
  case OverloadedType(pre, alternatives)  => alternatives map pre.memberType

```

this assumes `tree.symbol.isOverloaded` implies `tree.tpe.isInstanceOf[OverloadedType]`, which this bug illustrates is not necessarily the case
