The following code is not allowed:

{code}
class Foo extends { def bar = "bar" } with Any
{code}

Giving the error:

{code}
error: only concrete field definitions allowed in early object initialization section
class Foo extends { def bar = "bar" } with Any
                        ^
{code}

It would be nice if this restriction were lifted. I'd like to be able to use a method that depends on the fields in early initialization from within the constructor. (I actually ran into this while trying to work around SI-911 , but it would be nice to be able to do).
