ListMap and ListSet have basically zero reason to exist if they don't preserve insertion order.  Except there _isn't even a mutable.ListSet_.  I think this suggests that the mutable one should just be deprecated.  If you reeeeeally need the functionality of traversal-in-order, there is LinearHashMap/Set, and if you reeeeeeally need speed you should implement your own anyway.  In the meantime, before deprecation kicks in, insertion order is probably a good thing to preserve.  I have no strong feeling about which order.

For immutable.ListSet/Map, I think either order is okay as long as it is incredibly clear what the expectation is, and it is followed for every operation.  That is: head gives you the _most recent_ item and iteration is _always_ from recent to older; or head gives you the _oldest_ item and iteration is _always_ from recent to older.  And this property should be maintained through map, flatMap, etc. (which will mean using builders to create the underlying links because otherwise the order will switch every time you map).
