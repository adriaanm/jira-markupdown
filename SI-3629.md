I'm experiencing weird GC issues in an actor-heavy application. VisualVM shows the objects that survive GC for many generations are all instances of scala.actors.threadpool.LinkedBlockingQueue$$Node class. 

I inspected the code for the class in question in Scala and found it is actually a copy of Doug Lea's public-domain LinkedBlockingQueue code. 

Now, a bug was discovered in it that causes large LinkedBlockingQueue lists to choke GC. The effect is known as "object nepotism". See <http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6805775>, <http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6806875>, and <http://tech.puredanger.com/2009/02/11/linkedblockingqueue-garbagecollection/>

Doug Lea acknowledged and fixed the bug, it is in Java 1.6.0_19. Changeset is in <http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/tl/jdk/rev/49573ab3096a>

However, Scala didn't update its private copy of the code with Doug's fixes yet. Looking at <http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/actors/scala/actors/threadpool/LinkedBlockingQueue.java> shows Scala still uses the old code.

I believe our GC issues are caused by the manifestation of the bug Doug fixed. Could you update the private copy of that class in Scala, please?
(In r22542) Updated LinkedBlockingQueue to latest jsr166 version. Verified bug fix using test case in  [http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6806875 JDK bug report 6806875]. Closes #3629.
