Weary of endless github wars over comment formatting? Wouldn't it be nice if Scala recovered the semicolon, which is on the brink of extinction, for line comments? Only if it is the leading non-whitespace.
```scala
  // boring
  val x = 42

  /** Annoying sparkles in my eyes.
    * With the weird indentation.
    */
  val y = 17

  ; exciting! punctuated equilibrium in language evolution
  ; I could go on and on about how it doesn't look like Java.
  def z = ???

  ; I space them qua separators
  for (v <- vs ; w <- ws if v < w) yield (v, w)
```
