Commit 1b14f49ff297a29c489dd184ee8f1f3c885a1b33 added the following to AbsSettings:

+  // an argument list which (should) be usable to recreate the Settings
+  def recreateArgs = userSetSettings.toList flatMap (_.unparse)

But MutableSettings.copy was overlooked and to this day contains the code:

    val xs = userSetSettings flatMap (_.unparse)
    s.processArguments(xs.toList, true)

Note the misplaced toList. Could someone please fix MutableSettings, perhaps like:

    s.processArguments(recreateArgs, true)

Thanks!
