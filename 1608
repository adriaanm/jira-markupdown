As far as I can see this happens because BatchImageBuilder.cleanOutputFolders takes a copyBack parameter and at the end of the method, it does:
```scala
if (copyBack)
  copyExtraResourcesBack(sourceLocation, true);
```

ScalaJavaBuilderAspect does:
```scala
  void around() : cleanOutputFolders() && cflow(build()) {
    // Just suppress the behaviour
  }
```

We need a way to get back that copy back part of the method, I would guess.
