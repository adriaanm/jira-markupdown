As far as I can see this happens because BatchImageBuilder.cleanOutputFolders takes a copyBack parameter and at the end of the method, it does:

{code}
if (copyBack)
  copyExtraResourcesBack(sourceLocation, true);
{code}

ScalaJavaBuilderAspect does:

{code}
  void around() : cleanOutputFolders() && cflow(build()) {
    // Just suppress the behaviour
  }
{code}

We need a way to get back that copy back part of the method, I would guess.
