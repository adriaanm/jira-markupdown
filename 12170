I accept that it might be quite specific but I also think I could be generalized so this high order method could receive an state, in general:
```scala
f: (A, S) â‡’ (S, GenTraversableOnce[B])
```

This reminds me of  `fold` but flattening the passed function result. In fact, In my examples I stated that, without any change, the same formal behavior can be achieved by the use of `fold` and the appending or concatenation of elements to the accumulated results. This flattening fold I propose would increase many applications performance.
