Having **#define XDESC abc** in the header and **@param x $$XDESC** in the scaladoc above the method definition, there is no spacing between **x** and **abc** in the generated HTML. So the reader sees

*x*abc

but it should be

**x** abc

As I have just realized, spacing is missing because of **longer parameter names** and not because of #define. So my first example is not correct, I should have taken a long parameter name, not just *x*.

Scaladoc seems to assume a maximum length of parameter names what turns out to be inappropriate.

Scaladoc-Version: 2.9.0.final

Thanks, Peter
(kzys in [r25337](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25337)) Should not set the parameter name's width on CSS. Fixed #4589. Review by pedrofurla.
