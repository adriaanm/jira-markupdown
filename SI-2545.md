I've got a construct:

```scala
    trait Frog[T] {
      def hello: T 
      def size: Int                                                                                                                                                          
    }

    trait OnlyWithFrogs {
      self: Frog[_] =>

        def sizeStr = size.toString
    }

```


The OnlyWithFrogs trait must be mixed into a Frog (no, it's not okay to make it derive from Frog).  The above code worked with 2.7.5, but fails in 2.8 with:

```scala
    : error: illegal cyclic reference involving type _$$1
    [WARNING]   self: Frog[_] =>
```


So, I tried to make my own wildcard:

```scala
      self: Frog[(Q forSome {type Q})] =>
```


This compiles, but when I try to create a concrete instance:

```scala
    object Ribbit extends Frog[String] with OnlyWithFrogs {
      def hello = "Hi"
      def size = 44
    }
```


The results in the following compile-time error:

    [WARNING]  error: illegal inheritance;
    [WARNING]  self-type net.liftweb.mapper.Ribbit.type does not conform to net.liftweb.mapper.OnlyWithFrogs's selftype net.liftweb.mapper.OnlyWithFrogs with net.liftweb.mapper.Frog[Q forSome { type Q }]
    [WARNING] object Ribbit extends Frog[String] with OnlyWithFrogs {
