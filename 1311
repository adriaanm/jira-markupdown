I fear that would be too complicated. Companion objects are meant to model the capabilities of Java statics. This goes far beyond that. The proposed change would also introduce ambiguities. Given
```scala
object TestComponent {
  object TestService {
    final val TESTSTRING = "TestString"
  }
  trait TestService {}
}

trait TestComponent {
  trait TestService {
  }
}
```
would object TestService now be a companion object of both traits?
