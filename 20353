See attached exception traces.

With Scala 2.11.8 and Hadoop CDH v5.4, calling `typeOf` on a type annotated with the Hadoop `InterfaceAudience` annotation causes a `scala.reflect.internal.Symbols$CyclicReference: illegal cyclic reference involving object InterfaceAudience` exception in the REPL. (This is a problem since I use the Ammonite REPL, and it always calls `typeOf` on types it wants to print to the console. But the issue exists independent of which REPL I am using, given the attached trace is in the regular REPL.)

The interesting thing is that calling `typeOf` with the fully-qualified reference causes a different exception: `java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: no symbol could be loaded from interface org.apache.hadoop.classification.InterfaceAudience$Public in object InterfaceAudience with name Public and classloader scala.reflect.internal.util.ScalaClassLoader$URLClassLoader@536aaa8d`
