Thrilled as I would be were it otherwise, never in my life have instructions which involved maven allowed me to reproduce a bug, and the perfect record still stands.

{code}
[ERROR] BUILD ERROR

Missing:
----------
1) org.scala-lang:scala-library:jar:2.8.0

  Try downloading the file manually from the project website.

  Then, install it using the command: 
      mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.scala-lang -DartifactId=scala-library -Dversion=2.8.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file

  Alternatively, if you host your own repository you can deploy the file there: 
      mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=org.scala-lang -DartifactId=scala-library -Dversion=2.8.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file -Durl=[url] -DrepositoryId=[id]

  Path to dependency: 
  	1) net.pragmaticdesign:mvn-scala-skin:jar:0.2-SNAPSHOT
  	2) org.scala-lang:scala-library:jar:2.8.0

2) org.scala-lang:scala-compiler:jar:2.8.0

But please don't tell me how to work around that.  You have to subtract maven from the equation if you want to report a scalac bug.

> If you want me to export the project and attach it I can do that.

No, absolutely not.  What I would like is for you to paste the shortest possible self-contained test case which reproduces the issue.  If you are able to determine the revision which introduced the issue, that too would be very helpful (but without a self-contained test case I can't verify a fix.)
Absolutely sorry about that I had forgotten how I build this project.  I realized what I had done after I went to bed and it was too late to update the ticket (kids don't let me escape to the computer too often)

It is still mostly private and I install the scala 2.8 artifact myself locally.  I will quickly make a stand alone project that you can compile by hand.  

I will update this ticket as soon as I have it online.

I will spend a couple hours now trying to reduce the scope of the project down to just the classes that cause the problem.
