It sounds like SI-2201, which I have a patch for but do not want to commit without it being approved (or more likely, improved) by martin or adriaan.  That was the bug that needed to be fixed for scalacheck to compile and it's very believable that scalaz and scalacheck would induce the same bugs.

If you want you can build the repo with the patch and see if it works - or hopefully it'll be in trunk soon.  http://github.com/paulp/scala/tree/scalacheck
