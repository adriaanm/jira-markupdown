I read the docs of implicit classes here: http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/implicit-classes.html

And these comments:

    Odersky: "An implicit class must have a primary constructor with exactly one argument in its first parameter list." I do not see a rason for this restriction. AFAICS the class can have arbitrary parameter lists. You just create an implicit method with the same parameters. 


    Suereth: Right. I was conflating value classes + implicit classes in that part of the spec.


In that light, it looks to me that this should be accepted:

scala> implicit class C(x: String, y: String)
<console>:8: error: implicit classes must accept exactly one primary constructor parameter
       implicit class C(x: String, y: String)


Multi parameter implicit defs aren't 100% useless, as I found out when asking once why they were allowed without warning.

```scala
scala> implicit def foo(a: Int, b: String) = 0
foo: (a: Int, b: String)Int

scala> implicitly[(Int, String) => Int].apply(0, "")
res3: Int = 0
```

But I've never seen this used.

For the record, default parameters don't kick in in time to render multi-parameter implicit defs as views.

```scala
scala> implicit def foo(a: Int, b: String = "") = ""
foo: (a: Int, b: String)String

scala> 0 : String
<console>:17: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(0)
 required: String
              0 : String
              ^
```

Multi parameter list implicit classes can be useful if the second paramater list is implicit:

```scala
scala> implicit class Foo(a: Int)(implicit c: reflect.ClassTag[Int]) { def bar = "" }
defined class Foo

scala> 0.bar
res8: String = ""
```

But we don't enforce that:

```scala
scala> implicit class Foo(a: Int)(b: Any) { def bar = "" }
defined class Foo
```

Overall, I think that the status quo is acceptable.
