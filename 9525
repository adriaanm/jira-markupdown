Is the last expression here therefore equally wrong?

{code}
scala> 1d.hashCode
res0: Int = 1072693248

scala> 1d.##
res1: Int = 1

scala> class Foo(val x: Double) extends AnyVal
defined class Foo

scala> new Foo(1d).hashCode
res2: Int = 1072693248

scala> new Foo(1d).##
res3: Int = 1072693248
{code}

(Also, is it part of this ticket, or a separate issue?)
