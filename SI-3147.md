Would it make sense to add a note in the scaladoc for CharSequenceReader (and other Reader that make use of EofCh of value '\032') that EofCh is the char of value '\032'. Also it can cause issue when parsing with the def elem(kind: String, p: (Elem) => Boolean) where the predicate is being anything except some value. The EofCh marker may then be confused with the input itself, causing an endless recursion.

I'm new to parser combinators and spent quite a bit of time figuring this out. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2387892/parser-combinator-not-terminating-how-to-log-what-is-going-on.

I don't feel knowledgeable enough to provide a patch, but I think a note of caution in the scaladoc would be enough.
here's the ScalaDoc of CharSequenceReader.first, which does mention EofCh:
```scala
Returns the first element of the reader, or EofCh if reader is at its end
```
What exactly would you like to see added?
