I'd be interested in this, and would be willing to take a stab at it. Any thoughts or suggestions, @ureche?

As @sethtisue told me, Scaladoc is part of the Scala compiler so it should be in the https://github.com/scala/scala repository, mostly under src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc, but I haven't looked into it yet.

It looks like Spark has [solved](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16822) the problem by directly [editing api-docs.js](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14438/commits/2a480caba91dd912eeda8b2b4393f9be11061310).

Could we make this the default behavior?
