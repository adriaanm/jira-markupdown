If you run both "all.clean test" and "all.clean test-opt" then no power in the universe can blame you for a problem.  As you can see, I'm not religious about test-opt.  And as you didn't see because I sent it to devel, it wasn't your or my fault anyway: with the patch the pattern matcher started generating code which triggered SI-2171.
