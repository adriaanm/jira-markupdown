I think we need to take a step back here. Suddenly =>? is much less attractive than

I think we should refrain from making it work with a quick hack. These hacks always have a high long-term cost in terms of language complexity. So, let's back out now, and think whether at some point we can come up with a more general solution to the problem, or whether maybe we come to the conclusion that the problem is not worth solving.
