This bug makes it impossible to expose a stable identifier in a class without creating a useless field. This limitation becomes particularly disheartening when dealing with small objects that implement an interface that exposes a stable identifier (e.g. a vector that exposes its vector space).

An alternative solution might be to permit {{@uncheckedStable}} to apply to defs (wouldn't that open up a nice can of worms?).

Please unburden our precious little stable identifiers from the crushing weight of gc-intensive java fields.
