For trunk (past week, maybe several weeks), when breaking in app.main, line numbers are not available in netbeans or eclipse.  In jdb, "run app" with "stop in app.main" shows a line number of -1.  Class and method breakpoints to class methods (i.e. not main) do give me the right line numbers.

I have explicitly compiled with -g:vars and without.

Here's some jdb transcripts that may help demonstrate (peaktraffic is an object with the usual main)

> stop in peaktraffic.main

Breakpoint hit: "thread=main", peaktraffic.main(), line=-1 bci=0

> stop in Graph.remapV

> cont

Breakpoint hit: "thread=main", Graph.remapV(), line=196 bci=0

Note: if I name the object with a trailing $$, I do get line numbers:

> stop in peaktraffic$$.main

> run peaktraffic

Breakpoint hit: "thread=main", peaktraffic$$.main(), line=356 bci=0

I am 100% certain that the gui debuggers used to stop me in main with line numbers.  Now it doesn't.  It's too difficult to convince eclipse or netbeans to refer to my main class as "mainclass$$" instead of mainclass.

Finally, I'd note that I can't break in **any** object other than app except by referring to it as object$$ rather than object in jdb.
I'm not sure what a position is (maybe the bci after line), but if you mean: can I effectively step when line=-1, the answer is no.

That's not even the right number of steps.  This is right:
