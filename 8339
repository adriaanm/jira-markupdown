This is still the problem, yes.  It doesn't matter that they're in separate jars; they are both on the standard classpath.  If you explode the jars they will ovewrite one another on a case-insensitive filesystem.  The are numerous situations where this has a chance of biting people; there's no reason to do it.  In fact splitting the package across multiple jars breaks OSGI, as someone noted elsewhere.
