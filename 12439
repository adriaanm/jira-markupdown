The modified encoding isn't handled (jvms 4.4.7):

There are two differences between this format and the "standard" UTF-8 format.
First, the null character (char)0 is encoded using the 2-byte format rather than the
1-byte format, so that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls. Second,
only the 1-byte, 2-byte, and 3-byte formats of standard UTF-8 are used. The Java
Virtual Machine does not recognize the four-byte format of standard UTF-8; it uses
its own two-times-three-byte format instead.

So, 0 and supplementary chars in constants are fffd.

scala> val x = new str.Test
x: str.Test = str.Test@c808207

scala> x.str
res0: String = imagine JIRA allowed posting unicode comments instead of reporting "communications failure"

scala> str.Test.STR
res1: String = ����������������
