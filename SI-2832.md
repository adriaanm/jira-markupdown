Operator '<==' has lower precedence than '&', which causes the following code to not work:

{code}
(this + ("foo", "bar")) & -this & this <== socialMessage
{code}

Changing '<==' into '<' or '<--' causes it to work fine:

{code}
(this + ("foo", "bar")) & -this & this <-- socialMessage
{code}

As Scala operator precedence depends only on the first character, it should not matter whether the operator '<==' or '<--' is used.
Three things:

1) Please follow the [wiki:TracGuide guide] and delimit your code properly.

2) "to not work" is a grossly insufficient problem description.

3) If you're going to post code which "does not work" it'd really help if you posted all of it rather than making someone reconstruct it from bread crumbs.

4) Scala version, or any clue at all about your environment?

5) Closing as invalid since this compiles fine.
{code}
class B
class A {
  def &(x: A): A = new A
  def +(x: Any): A = new A
  def unary_- : A = new A

  def <==(x: B): A = new A
  def <--(x: B): A = new A
  
  val socialMessage: B = new B
  
  def foo1 = (this + ("foo", "bar")) & -this & this <== socialMessage
  def foo2 = (this + ("foo", "bar")) & -this & this <-- socialMessage
}
{code}

{code}
class Bar
class Foo {
    def & (that: Bar): Foo = this
    def <==(that: Foo): Bar = new Bar()
    def <--(that: Foo): Bar = new Bar()

    // Compiles:
    this & (this <== this)
    // Does not compile but should because '<' has higher precedence than '&':
    // this & this <== this
    // Compiles:
    this & this <-- this
}
{code}
