When compiling with `-Xcheckinit`, the compiler-generated bitmap field(s) are not marked synthetic.  For example:

```
$ ~/Programs/scala-2.11.7/bin/scala -Xcheckinit
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.7 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_51).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> final class Foo(constant: Double) { val value: Double = constant }
defined class Foo

scala> classOf[Foo].getDeclaredFields
res0: Array[java.lang.reflect.Field] = Array(private final double Foo.value, private volatile boolean Foo.bitmap$init$0)

scala> res0.last.isSynthetic
res1: Boolean = false
```

This may cause a problem for reflection-based tools that specifically must ignore synthetic fields for correctness (e.g. see this [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/equalsverifier/fM1N9bd-guM/ON1iR6j6CAAJ) related to the EqualsVerifier library).

A similar [issue](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/MslWXyQJ6Os/4S7YMAvCc_IJ) was raised on the scala-internals mailing list last year, and there seemed to be agreement that such compiler-generated bitmap fields should be marked synthetic.  However, I was unable to find an associated issue in JIRA.
