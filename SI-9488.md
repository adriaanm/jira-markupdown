I noticed that in 2.12.x, `DefaultPromise` has inherited the `toString` of the its new parent,  `AtomicReference`.

```scala
scala> Promise.apply[String]()
res16: scala.concurrent.Promise[String] = List()
```

This unnecessarily leaks implementation details.

I think "<promise>" would be better. We might want to include the completion status, too.

`Future` could take the same treatment.
This was reported against 2.11.8 by @nilskp at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-user/FjhQGH7TII0/DPz8tOVUAgAJ

I suggest we backport the 2.12 fix for 2.11.9.
another possibility would be to restore the 2.11.7 behavior:

```
scala> concurrent.Promise.apply[String]()
res0: scala.concurrent.Promise[String] = scala.concurrent.impl.Promise$DefaultPromise@71dac704
```
