The code in question compiled well in 2.9.1, after updating to 2.10.1 the compiler now fails with an uncaught exception.

Token.scala does not contain any switch, so no idea what it is complaining about.

The issue SI-6011 mentioned in the message claims that was something fixed in 2.10.0-M5 so I assume it appearing in 2.10.1 is something not covered by the fixed SI-6011
