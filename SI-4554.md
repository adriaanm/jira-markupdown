=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
  mkdir testpartest
  cd testpartest
  wget --no-check-certificate --quiet https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/scala-nightly-main/ws/scala/dists/sbaz-partest.tgz
  tar xzf sbaz-partest.tgz
  mkdir test
  cd test
  for ii in library devel test
  do
   unzip -q -o ../sbaz/scala-$$ii-[0-9]*-*.sbp
  done
  chmod u+x bin/*
  # try partest
  bin/partest --all
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Tests run.

=== What do you see instead? ===

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Directory 'test' not found.
	at scala.sys.package$$.error(package.scala:27)
	at scala.tools.partest.nest.PathSettings$$$$anonfun$$testRoot$$1$$$$anonfun$$apply$$2.apply(PathSettings.scala:24)

{code}

=== Additional information ===

This functionality has been broken for a long time. Currently it is possible to get partest to run on the binary distribution by using symbolic links and other hacks, but this should really be fixed once and for all.


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

Current trunk.
