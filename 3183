I could create a smaller test-case, though it depends on third-party libraries. I have attached my sources (and another compiled class). You'll find a zip including the deps here:

http://www.footprint.de/test/scala/annot.zip

Calling 

`scalac -cp classes:guice-2.0.jar:aopalliance-1.0.jar:servlet-api-2.5.jar:quartz-1.7.0.jar src/test.scala`

will throw the exception.

I hope you can reproduce it with this example and track down the problems.

Best regards, --- Jan.
