I think your way is better if we want to avoid creating an `ActorProxy` *at all*. I prefer my option if we only want to avoid creating an `ActorProxy` when we supply an `Actor` in the constructor, but we do want one automatically when we use the default constructor.

So I think it depends what the intended semantics are. The latter one makes more sense to me (of course!), but I don't know the full reason for Philipp's comment. I've sent an email to Philipp pointing him to this ticket, so we'll await his reply.
