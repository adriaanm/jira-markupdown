Here are two little problems with fsc error handling.  First, `scalac -Xshow-phases` does not work--it prints out a help message.  Similarly, `scalac foo.scala -Xshow-phases`, where `foo.scala` is an empty file, also does not work but in a different way: there is no output shown at all.

The second problem is that `fsc foo.scala -asdf` gives a curious error message:
{code}
(FakePos(fsc),bad option: '-asdf'
  fsc -help  gives more information)
{code}

There should be no FakePos in the output.

These are little things, but they would be nice to clean up.
