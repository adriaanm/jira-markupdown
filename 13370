Since trait Actor is Serializable, so should the subclasses:
```scala
public final scala.Function0 scala.actors.Actor$$$$anonfun$$scala$$actors$$Actor$$$$seq$$1.next$$1 [class=scala.actors.Actor$$$$anonfun$$loop$$1] <----- field that is not serializable
```

(sorry to bother with all those Serializable things I encounter...)
