Just to add another angle: SI-6596 demonstrates that refinement owners aren't consistent in joint and separate compilation.

Martin's states over there: "I believe owners for refinement types are a compiler-internal artefact only.".

That might be true, but the compiler does need to make sense of the owners for asSeenFrom to work, as this ticket shows.
