Another example where this isn't working. The {{context.scope}} checked by {{nonImplicitSynonymInScope}} doesn't contain the template member {{x}}.

{code}
object Test1 {
  object A { implicit val x: Int = 1 }
  import A.x
  def x: Int = 0
  implicitly[Int]
}
{code}

By contrast, this does shadow:

{code}
object Test2 {
  object A { implicit val x: Int = 1 }
  
  {
    import A.x
    def x: Int = 0
    implicitly[Int]
  }
}
{code}
