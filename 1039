I have updated the files: symbol.scala should compile without any external dependencies.

Note that {{scalac -optimise}} is very easy to crash for _any_ non-trivial source module.
So the example included here is more or less arbitrary.  (These sources are from [http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/src/Pure])
