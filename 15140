When you create a BigDecimal from an Int in the range of [-512, 512] the value is cached. The cached BD is returned when a new BD is attempted to be created with the same numeric value but a different MathContext. I believe the fix would be to simply change the line:
*if (minCached <= i && i <= maxCached)* 
to something like
*if (minCached <= i && i <= maxCached && mc == defaultMathContext)*.

The following can be pasted straight into the REPL to see the behavior:

{code}
import scala.math.BigDecimal._
import java.math.{ MathContext, BigDecimal => BigDec }
//Create two similar BDs
val a = BigDecimal(12)
val b = BigDecimal(12, MathContext.DECIMAL128)
//Not the same! Unexpected
println(b.mc == MathContext.DECIMAL128)
//The same! Unexpected
println(a.mc == b.mc)
//This should work but instead throws an exception
println(b / 7)
{code}
