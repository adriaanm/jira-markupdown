There is no way to define a string interpolation template separately from the interpolation, nor to compose multiple templates.  [Thread.|https://groups.google.com/group/scala-sips/browse_thread/thread/de7ea273874bb1d] It was suggested by Miles that
{noformat}
It'd be nice if we could get that back and write something like,

 // Inferred type should be Int => String
final val template = s"""This is string $(_:Int)."""

Then all of your examples boil down to function application and/or composition.
{noformat}
to which eugene said "Could you submit an enhancement request for that please?", a request which I am presently fielding.
Not to be too picky, but I'd imagine the syntax would be this:

{code}
val template = s"""This is string ${_:Int}."""
{code}

In don't understand why it doesn't work, actually. It should expand to:

{code}
val template = new StringContext("""This is string""").s(_: Int)
{code}

Which is valid code.

PR for etapolation at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2793 was closed because of jitters.

The thread suggests more could be done with names in a StringContext, so this is not a duplicate of SI-7715. `cmp"$smaller is smaller than $bigger"(x,y)` where the `cmp` does the obvious computation and makes the args available to the template by name, as it were from the context local to the StringContext.

That "etapolation" coinage might be the best I ever manage; except for the "intersobralator" used by implicitNotFound.
