If a class/trait has a companion object, a link is always generated ("go to companion"), regardless of whether the object is public. The object correctly does not appear in the index on the left.

(In r24628) [scaladoc] Don't create broken link to private companion object. Closes SI-4374. Review by pedrofurla.
