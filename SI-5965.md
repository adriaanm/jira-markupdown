```scala
abstract class Param
class Test
object Test {
  def apply(i: Int): Test = new Test
  def apply(i: Int, p: Param = new Param { }): Test = new Test
}
```
leads to:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: 'method apply' that isn't a class, trait or object cannot be built as a documentable template
```
