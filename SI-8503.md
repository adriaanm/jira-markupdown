From the command line if I enter "scala -version" it returns with exitCode = 1, and outputs to stderr "Scala code runner version 2.10.3 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL"

Just asking that the version should not be an error.
It seems to me that -version should behave the same as other info messages like -Xshow-phases or -help.

I would refactor -version to CompilerCommand to enforce that uniformity.

Then the question is whether the current behavior is useful.  I'm not sure why scalac differs from the runner, but arguably scalac -version foo.scala && scala Foo means I think my file was recompiled if it is run. I just wanted to make sure I always use the correct version of the compiler.

Similarly, scala -Xshow-phases foo.scala && scala bar.scala just means I want to verify some info in the middle of the compound command.

Maybe it needs the equivalent of -Xfatal-warnings, such as -Xfatal-info for the current behavior.

Just to clarify:
{code}
apm@mara:~$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.10.4-RC3 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL
apm@mara:~$ echo $?
0
apm@mara:~$ scalacm -version
Scala compiler version 2.11.0-RC3 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL
apm@mara:~$ echo $?
0
apm@mara:~$ scalacm -version junk.scala
Scala compiler version 2.11.0-RC3 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL
apm@mara:~$ echo $?
0
{code}
The difference is:
{code}
apm@mara:~$ scalam -version
Scala code runner version 2.11.0-RC3 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL
apm@mara:~$ echo $?
1
{code}
My proposal was that you can request whether info messages result in a non-zero exit code.


This version makes the info output uniformly exit code zero albeit output on stderr, consistent with java.
