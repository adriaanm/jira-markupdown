Since `getClass` mostly makes sense within the scope of (Java) reflection and since reflection uses the boxed versions of values (`Integer` for `int`, etc) it may be logical to have `1.getClass` return `classOf[Integer]`.

In that sense fixing SI-496 may still fix that issue.

I agree this would be a situation where Scala's object model would loose some of its purity by exposing the messy boxing business. On the other hand, when doing reflection, one has to deal with it.

Let's decide once we have a better idea on how Scala's own reflection system will look.
