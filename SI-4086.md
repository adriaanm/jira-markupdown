The synthetic synchronized method has this signature:
```scala
def synchronized [T0] (arg0: T0) : T0 
```
This is not logical.  If it isn't (arg0: => T0) then the method isn't likely to accomplish much.  (The implementation treats synchronized as a primitive and apparently ignores the signature.)

Also, it makes me uncomfortable that synchronized goes completely unmentioned in the spec.  If String.+ can inspire epic poems, then surely something as critical as synchronization can win a pittance.  (The ticket already exists: #494.)
I'm primarily talking about the scaladoc, which offers the signature shown in the ticket.  We can consider the fact that the compiler fakes the bynameness an implementation detail: I don't think it needs to be documented at the user level.  But we can't give it the wrong signature.

By the way, the reason this came up was that it was making fixing the "warn dead code" option very difficult, because:
```scala
  f(throw new Exception)
  g(throw new Exception)
```
The contents of method f are unreachable if f is by-name, but not g.  So the compiler, believing "synchronized" to be a normal method, would complain about all such blocks.  And I had to add more hacks to hack around the first hack.

That kind of thing makes me believe that synchronized should be implemented as a by-name method, and rather than special casing it where it is now, we special case the closure creation later.
I added synchronized to the AnyRef methods, with a one-line comment.
I think the compiler would be complicated greatly if synchronized was a call-by-name method. It's probably easier to make a special case in ScalaDoc. Reassigning to scaladoc_team.
