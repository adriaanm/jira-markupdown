Since it was assigned to me (although that might have been accidental) I looked at it yesterday, and I was able to reproduce it as well, though it wasn't easy.  I couldn't reproduce it in eclipse, but then I can never reproduce anything in eclipse.  I eventually reproduced it with javac (had to be 1.6 on OSX to get that error.)

What I failed to do was find an automated way to test the validity of the generics signatures throughout all the class files.  I would really like to find a static tool which I can run on all the classfiles for info, but so far I have had to write code which invokes trackSetInfo in order to discover that the generics signature is wrong.

Proguard chokes on what might be a related issue - there is an open bug from seth tissue here:
