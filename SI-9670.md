The precision of DecimalFormat with Scala BigDecimal seems lower than that of DecimalFormat with Java BigDecimal (please see code snippet below)

This was an unexpected difference, but the precision of the underlying value doesn't seem to have been lost, just the String representation.

Tested in Scala 2.11.7 in OpenJDK 8 on Debian.
```
val df = new DecimalFormat()
df.setMaximumFractionDigits(2)
df.setMinimumFractionDigits(2)
println(df.format(BigDecimal("70368744177664.09",MathContext.UNLIMITED).underlying())) -> 70,368,744,177,664.09
println(df.format(BigDecimal("70368744177664.09",MathContext.UNLIMITED))) -> 70,368,744,177,664.10
```

As discussed in https://github.com/typelevel/scala/issues/95#issuecomment-188749850, this is a limitation of the JDK class `DecimalFormat` and not something we can workaround in `scala.BigDecimal`. Remembering to calliing `underlying` is the only solution I can see.
