this compiles:

{code}
class Test extends javax.swing.JFrame {
    private object Schnuck extends javax.swing.AbstractListModel {
        def getSize = 0
        def getElementAt( idx: Int ) : AnyRef = error( "egal" )
        def gaga : Int = this.getSize
    }
}
{code}

but this:

{code}
class Test extends javax.swing.JFrame {
    private object Schnuck extends javax.swing.AbstractListModel {
        model =>
        def getSize = 0
        def getElementAt( idx: Int ) : AnyRef = error( "egal" )
        def gaga : Int = model.getSize
   }
}
{code}

produces an error:

{code}
<console>:28: error: object Schnuck cannot be instantiated because it does not conform to its self-type Test.this.Schnuck.type
       class Test extends javax.swing.JFrame {
                  ^
{code}

although i cannot instantiate an object, why can't i assign a self-type here which really just is an alias, and i need it from inner objects (e.g. functions) since "this" changes meaning.

smaller test case:

{code}
trait C

class Outer {
  object O extends C { self => }
}
{code}

2.8.0.final:
{code}
t3612.scala:3: error: object O cannot be instantiated because it does not conform to its self-type Outer.this.O.type
class Outer {
            ^
one error found
{code}
(In r22979) closes SI-3612. relaxed self-type conformance check slightly by comparing the self types instead of the self-type symbols, which are trivially different when you introduce a self variable without giving it a type

given the definitions below (for full context, see test file), before, O0 would work but O would not, now both are accepted:

{code}
object O0 extends C {}
object O extends C { self => }
{code}
