(extempore in [r25613|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25613]) Intersection types made specializable.

Formerly a specializable type parameter would be missed if in
an intersection.

  trait Trait[@specialized T] {
    def f[T](x: Foo[T] with Bar) = x
  }

Now that is specialized, as it already was in the "Foo[T]" case.
Closes SI-4794, no review.
