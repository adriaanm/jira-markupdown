{code}
trait A
trait B extends A
abstract class C[T <: A] {
  def f(t: T)(s: String): T
}
  
class D extends C[B] {
  def f(b: B)(i: Int) = b
}
{code}

Compiling this gives the error message:

{noformat}
[error] E:\prog\jvm\test\a\a.scala:7: class D needs to be abstract, since method
 f in class C of type (t: B)(s: String)B is not defined
[error] (Note that T does not match B)
[error] class D extends C[B] {
[error]       ^
[error] one error found
{noformat}

The real error here is of course that "Int" in the implementation should be "String". However, the message "(Note that T does not match B)" is less than helpful in figuring out this.
