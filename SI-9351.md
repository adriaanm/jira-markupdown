When pattern matching on a tuple of sealed and unsealed types, the compiler gives warnings as if both were sealed. To illustrate, compiling this:

{code:scala}
trait A {}
case object B extends A {}
case object C extends A {}

class X {
  def good {
    val a: A = B
    a match {
      case B =>
      case C =>
    }
  }

  def bad {
    val a: A = B
    val o: Option[Int] = None
    (a, o) match {
      case (B, None) =>
      case (B, Some(_)) =>
      case (C, None) =>
      case (C, Some(_)) =>
    }
  }

  def alsoGood {
    val a: A = B
    val b: A = C
    (a, b) match {
      case (B, B) =>
      case (B, C) =>
      case (C, B) =>
      case (C, C) =>
    }
  }
}
{code}
gives:
{noformat}
$ scalac sealed.scala 
sealed.scala:18: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: (_, None), (_, Some(_))
    (a, o) match {
    ^
one warning found
{noformat}

Although it says "_" and admittedly the warning isn't exactly false, as {{val a: A}} could generally be something else than B/C, it is quite strange that this only happens when paired with a sealed type.
TODO: check if this is working after the fix for SI-9369
