Would one of you terribly mind explaining to me in a bit more detail what the concern is around this ad-hoc solution? Not challenging the decision—I'm quite happy to acknowledge that your instincts are much more likely to be right than mine on this—but I'd like to further develop my own sense of good-Scala/bad-Scala, and I still don't see the relevant difference between {{orderingToPartialOrdering}} and {{Seq.apply}} producing {{List}}&#8203;s. Is there some backwards compatibility issue that I'm missing? Or is it just a general principle of not wanting to invest any sort of effort in addressing a part of the problem if you're currently investing in solving the whole problem?
