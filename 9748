While classifying symbols for https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8220 it would be nice to think about this behavior once again. Do we want abstract methods generated for vals to be treated as vals? Do we not? Or maybe we should eschew this classification altogether and come up with something better (i.e. classes - objects - fields - methods - type members or even subdivide methods into methods - getters - setters)?
