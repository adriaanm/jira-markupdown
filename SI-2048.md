The Long type should behave in an equal manner like the Int type. Even though nobody wants to count from zero to the maximum of Int, there are occasions where you might want to use a for-loop in a range above Int (well I do ;-).

Example:
{code}
for (i <- startvalue until endvalue) {}
{code}
This is fine, if startvalue and endvalue are of type Int, but does not work for Long. This is an unexpected and confusing behaviour (for a beginner like me).

For the timebeing this can be enabled by importing the following implicit (probably not the best code):
{code}
  class LongIterable(start : Long, end : Long) extends Iterable[Long] {
    override def elements : Iterator[Long] = {
      var current = start
      return new Iterator[Long]() {
        override def hasNext() : Boolean = return current < end
        override def next() = {
          val result = current
          current += 1
          result
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  class UntilLong(value : Long) {
    def until(limit : Long) : LongIterable = {
      return new LongIterable(value, limit )
      
    }
  }
  
  implicit def Long2UntilLong(l : Long) : UntilLong = new UntilLong(l)

{code}

Unfortunately to get the full beauty of RichInt, until() has to provide a Range, which in turn is married to Int. So probably it is not that easy to implement after all.
It's not entirely done yet, but I can see you're not using trunk, because you can use Long:
{code}
scala> (Math.MAX_INT.toLong << 20) to ((Math.MAX_INT.toLong << 20) + 100) by 10
res16: GenericRange.Inclusive[Long] = 2251799812636672, 2251799812636682, 
2251799812636692, 2251799812636702, 2251799812636712, 2251799812636722,
2251799812636732, 2251799812636742, 2251799812636752, 2251799812636762, 
2251799812636772
{code}

Or for that matter, BigInt...
{code}
scala> (BigInt(Math.MAX_INT) << 100) to ((BigInt(Math.MAX_INT) << 100) + 5)
res17: GenericRange.Inclusive[BigInt] = 
2722258934099857107478767457957442486272,
2722258934099857107478767457957442486273, 
2722258934099857107478767457957442486274, 
2722258934099857107478767457957442486275, 
2722258934099857107478767457957442486276, 
2722258934099857107478767457957442486277
{code}
Or even Double:
{code}
scala> 0.0 to 1.0 by 0.025
res21: GenericRange.Inclusive[Double] = GenericRange.Inclusive(start=0.0, end=1.0, step=0.025)

scala> res21 sum
res22: Double = 20.5
{code}
