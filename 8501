I'd point the finger at erasure.

{code}
    // end of uncurry
    <method> def foo(): lang.this.Object{type Bar <: lang.this.Object}#Bar = {
    // end of erasure
    <method> def foo(): Foo.Bar = {
{code}

I'd expect the return type to erase to `Object`.

Seems like we get away with this under joint compilation.
