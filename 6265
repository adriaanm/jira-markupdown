I've got a handle on what's happening; I can't see how this was ever close to working.  When looking up method implementations for inlining, it only looks at base classes.  It needs to make the "lateral" jump to the implementation class to find anything worth inlining.  I'm not sure if it's finding the forwarder method, but it doesn't seem interested in inlining it if it is.  I hacked more logic into the inliner and eventually got to the point where the trait-defined method with implementation in Foo$class would be inlined; but then it fell apart because it has the wrong signature (i.e. the receiver is the first argument to a static method.)

So before I continue any more down this road, since it feels like rather a lot of "original research" for something I had thought was closer to working order, I thought I'd ask for a sanity check.
