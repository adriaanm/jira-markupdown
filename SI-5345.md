== what was done ==
I placed some code into the REPL like that in the following:
{code}
trait Test {
 implicit val x = new Test { override def toString = "trait Test" }
}
object Test {
 implicit val y = new Test { override def toString = "object Test" }
}
import Test._
def useTest(implicit t: Test) = print(t)
{code}
== what was observed == 
In the REPL
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_29)

Type in expressions to have them evaluated.

=== what it should have been ===
It probably shouldn't have produced the stackoverflow error.


You probably shouldn't be using straight val's in Test (at least not in the trait).

try this in the repl:

trait Test {
 val x = {println("x"); new Test { override def toString = "trait Test" }}
}
object Test {
 val y = {println("y"); new Test { override def toString = "object Test" }}
}
Test.y

turning them into lazy vals will fix this

We can't detect looping programs in general, so the compiler can't really do anything (useful enough) about this in general.


since this is not a bug, could you please move the discussion to the scala mailing list / stack overflow?
I'm afraid we must allocate our JIRA-related resources to bug discussion only, sorry.
