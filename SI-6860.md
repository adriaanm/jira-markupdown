I fixed this and am sending PR, opening ticket to record issue.

The compiler accepts this code and in the cases of f1 and f3 uses the type parameter as the type argument.
{code}
class Bippy[T](val value: T) extends annotation.StaticAnnotation

class A {
  def f1: Int @Bippy("hi") = 1
  def f2: Int @Bippy[String]("hi") = 2

  @throws("what do I throw?") def f3 = throw new RuntimeException
  @throws[RuntimeException]("that's good to know!") def f4 = throw new RuntimeException
}
{code}

I knew this must have come up before. Closing SI-2577 as duplicate of this (I will close this one too soon enough.)
