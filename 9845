Yes, that seems to be the problem, viz, java and JAVA_HOME do not jibe.

I was able to test this way, without munging my environment, thankfully. This is java at v6 and JAVA_HOME at v7; reflective invocation of javap finds the wrong tools.jar.
```scala
apm@mara:~/tmp/q$ JAVACMD=$JAVA6_HOME/bin/java JAVA_HOME=$JAVA7_HOME sbt12

It does indeed fail silently.  Boy, that's confusing.
