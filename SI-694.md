Maybe i just don't understand something altho I read the scaladocs, have browsed code, read the preprint actors chapter.

I have a hung actors program when run below code with "x" as argument

```scala
object V {
  import actors.Actor._
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val what = args(0)
    actor {
      react {
        case "" => sender ! None
        case _ =>
          actor {
            react {
              case _ => sender ! None
            }
          } ! ""
          react { case _ => sender ! None }
      }
    } !? what
  }
}
```

But the main should have gotten a None from the outer actor that it waited synchronously on.
Note that if run the code above with "" argument then it completes again with the None getting to the outer actor.
And if you change the outer actor (top level that main waits on) to use receive, then it also completes.

I'm testing with the 2.7.0 scala and JDK 5
 (1.5_10) on Solaris 10.

If you discover what I'm doing wrong here, pls point it out and/or show me the documentation.

Actually, when passing "x" as argument, the above code must block: when reacting to the message that is sent by the inner actor, `sender` (correctly) refers to the inner actor.

To make the program work, you have to save the original sender (from the outermost `!?`) in a local variable (call it `s`):

```scala
    actor {
      react {
        case "" => sender ! None
        case _ =>
          val s = sender // ADDED
          actor {
            react {
              case _ => sender ! None
            }
          } ! ""
          react { case _ => s ! None } // CHANGED
      }
    } !? what
```

Then, the program sends the reply to the right actor and returns as expected.

However, the fact that the original program did **not** hang when replacing the outer `react` with `receive` exposed a bug: inside the last `react`, `sender` incorrectly referred to the sender of the outer `receive`.

This bug is fixed in revision r14487.

Thanks for reporting this anomalous behavior.
