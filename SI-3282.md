Not sure if this is intended: Partest on a neg test will succeed if 
the compiler fails and a test file is absent. So we can by accident forget the check file and never notice a test failure. It also makes my workflow for having new tests more complicated. What I used to do is first run the test without a .check file and then move the .log file to the .check file. With the new scheme, I have to create a dummy check file first.
(In r21504) Correct oversight where neg tests didn't demand a checkfile.
More trying to get timeout/interrupted logic so we know when
things die but also don't impede interrupts.  Folded precondition
logic into test sequence logic, it's plenty general to cover it.
Closes SI-3282, review by phaller.
