I agree with the analysis. Furthermore, the prepending constructor doesn't set {{prev}} at all! It is a cut&paste copy from {{LinkedList}}:

{code}
  def this(elem: A, next: DoubleLinkedList[A]) {
    this()
    if (next != null) {
      this.elem = elem
      this.next = next
    }
  }
{code}

I'm figuring that initializing {{prev}} and fixing this constructor would be enough.
