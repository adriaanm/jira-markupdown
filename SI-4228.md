I don't know if I caused this or someone else, but you can't see files in the current directory anymore.  It's not a classpath issue, because . works for everything but the empty package.
{code}
// a.scala
class A

package xx {
  class B
}


% scalac29 a.scala

Boy, that took me a while to figure out.  By putting each line of input into a package ($$line0, $$line1, etc) I can no longer see the empty package, because you have to be in the empty package to see the empty package.

(In r24264) Created invisible setting to expose empty package members
outside of the empty package, so the repl can use packages
without going blind to the empty package.  This commit
also eliminates a deadlock which hits when the compiler starts
logging before a lazy val has pulled its head from the noose.
Closes SI-4228, review by odersky.
