Every structural call point generates bytecode of the following sort:
```scala
public static Method reflMethod$$Method1(Class x$$1) {
  if(reflMethod$$Cache1 == null || reflClass$$Cache1 != x$$1) {
    reflMethod$$Cache1 = x$$1.getMethod("getName", new Classr0);
    reflClass$$Cache1 = x$$1;
  }
  return reflMethod$$Cache1;
}
```

along with the two static fields it touches (the method and class
references). Shouldnt this method be synchronized or at least the
return value be the method that was found and not the static field?
