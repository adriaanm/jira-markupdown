Trying to use higher kinds and partially-applying type variables causes an AbstractMethodError at runtime. See the attached source code file.
something goes wrong during erasure:
need forwarders?

```scala
public interface Monad {
    public abstract Object bind(Object obj, Function1 function1);

    // Unreferenced inner class Monad$$$$anon$$1
    public static final class .anon._cls1 implements Monad {
        public Function1 bind(Function1 a$$2, Function1 f$$1)
```
