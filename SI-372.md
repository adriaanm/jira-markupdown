Scala 2.6.1 final[[BR]]
Hope this is the right place to fill a possible bug[[BR]]

{code}

scala> 1 -> "prr"
res93: (Int, java.lang.String) = (1,prr)

scala> 1.->("prr")
res92: (Double, java.lang.String) = (1.0,prr)

{code}

I'm just starting with scala, but my understanding is that {{ a->b }} is compiled into {{  a.->(b) }}, so the two expressions would give the same result. But in my test results are different, probably because scala is considering the dot as decimal separator and not as operator.

Feature or bug?
Indeed

{code}
scala> 1.toString
res0: java.lang.String = 1

scala> (1.0).toString
res1: java.lang.String = 1.0
{code}

I am not sure why being followed by letters rather than symbols should affect how many glyphs are matched as part of the number.
There's a special rule in the Scanner to treat fractions. I have updated the spec to reflect this:

If a floating point literal in a program is followed by a token
starting with a letter, there must be at least one intervening
whitespace character between the two tokens.
