from ClassTag:
```scala
  /** A ClassTag[T] can serve as an extractor that matches only objects of type T.
   *
   * The compiler tries to turn unchecked type tests in pattern matches into checked ones
   * by wrapping a `(_: T)` type pattern as `ct(_: T)`, where `ct` is the `ClassTag[T]` instance.
   * Type tests necessary before calling other extractors are treated similarly.
   * `SomeExtractor(...)` is turned into `ct(SomeExtractor(...))` if `T` in `SomeExtractor.unapply(x: T)`
   * is uncheckable, but we have an instance of `ClassTag[T]`.
   */
  def unapply(x: Any): Option[T] = unapply_impl(x)
```
