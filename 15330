Attempting to use java.io.Console to read a password throws the repl into weirdness and only reads in a single character:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val console = System.console
console: java.io.Console = java.io.Console@12781046

scala> console.readPassword("Enter pw: ")
Enter pw: 
res0: Array[Char] = Array(p)

scala> rreess00((00))

res1: Char = p

scala> ::qquuiitt
{code}
Also, when calls to the regular readLine method are made, the characters are not echoed to the screen:
{code}

scala> Console.readLine("Enter stuff: ")
Enter stuff: res0: String = stuff

scala> :quit
{code}
Both of these work as expected if run as a script instead of from the repl.  Scripts are attached.
