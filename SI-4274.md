=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
in the interactive shell type this

```scala
scala> val a = new scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int](10)
a: scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int] = ArraySeq(null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null)

scala> a(0) == null
<console>:7: warning: comparing values of types Int and Null using `==' will always yield false
       a(0) == null
            ^
res3: Boolean = true

scala> 
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

I would expect a specialized ArraySeq that initializes with 0 and does not use boxed Ints
```scala
val a = new scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int](10)
a: scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int] = ArraySeq(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 
  - Java: 6 64-bit
  - Operating system: Linux 64-bit
