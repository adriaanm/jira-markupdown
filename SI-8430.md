Running "scalac Test.scala" will output randomly one of the two warning messages above. One of them is more complete than the other, but is still missing the LetL(UnitLit) case.
This bug also affects RC3:

Here's a bashy way to test this:

{code}
% (f=test/files/neg/t8430.scala; (for i in {1..20}; do echo $f; done; printf "\n") | qbin/scalac -Xresident) 2>&1 | grep "fail" | sort | uniq | wc -l
       2
{code}
From the fix comment:

The counter-examples are still a bit off; I'm going to merge
that aspect of this ticket with SI-7746, in which we've
pinpointed the culpable part of the implementation, but haven't
had success in fixing the bug.
