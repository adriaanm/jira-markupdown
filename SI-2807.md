Currently if I write some code like this:
```scala
for(i <- 0 to 20){
   try{
      if(isGood(i)) return i
   }catch{
      case e => {
         System.out.println("Exception occurred. Continuing")
      }
   }
}
```
Then the catch statement ends up catching the value returned by the return statement. 

This is deeply confusing...


Would there be a possible workaround for this? E.g. could we declare that, by default, a pattern for an exception does not match NonLocalReturnException?

It would at least be nice to have some prominent documentation warning users about this problem.
You can find lots of messages from me over the last year pointing out that this is a problem.  Special casing that one specific exception is a non-starter.  More plausible is special casing scala.util.control.ControlException, from which that and others are derived.  However that's not a very good solution either.

I want to make case e => or case _ => ... compile time errors.  If you really want to catch Throwable (which you basically never should) you would have to say case e: Throwable.  However before I would push for that I really need to get scala.util.control.Exception into a more finished state.

By the way I put a warning in to complain about these a while ago.
```scala
% scala -Ywarn-catches

scala> // your code here

<console>:14: warning: catch clause swallows everything: not advised.
               case e => {
               ^
```
Even though the original report mentions a catch-all exception handler, NonLocalReturnException inherits from RuntimeException so it's even worse.

I'd suggest changing:

```scala
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends RuntimeException with ControlException
```

to

```scala
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends ControlException
```

That would be an improvement over the current situation.
Baby steps: This now emits a warning.

```scala
try x catch { case _ => }
```
