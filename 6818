"how could there possibly be an overload clash between a given class and its completely abstract parent?"

It's easy, because it doesn't matter what is abstract.  Overloading resolution does not ignore abstract methods - little would work correctly if it did.  Since the Foo in A and the Foo in B are different types, you arrive at an ambiguous overload pretty quickly.
