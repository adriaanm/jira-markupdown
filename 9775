I tested dist.tgz on

* Mac OSX 10.8.4
* Win7 64 bits
** with cmd.exe
** with cygwin inside cmd.exe
** with mintty/cygwin
* Ubuntu 10.10 VM

All console stuff works fine (line wrapping, backspace, history, paste, arrows, reverse search). For completeness I'll try a win 32 bits when I have time.

I started to browse the recent commits in jline2 and was reminded that it has an ["expand event"|https://github.com/jline/jline2/blob/master/src/main/java/jline/console/ConsoleReader.java#L635] feature that defaults to true. So !! recalls the previous line and in general anything starting with ! may cause IllegalArgumentException.

For instance try typing {{1 != 1}} with this 925 build.

You may need to [call|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/a49722990655633c2c97ddf5699adf25bc8bea76/src/jline/src/main/java/scala/tools/jline/console/ConsoleReader.java#L92] {{ConsoleReader.setExpandEvents(false)}}.
