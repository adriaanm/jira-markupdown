Unfortunately AnyRef specialization had to be removed from `Functions` in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/cc3badae17e. Discussion of the problems it caused is here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/5P5TS9ZWe_w/39S8q1WJYF8J.

We don't have plans to revisit this in forseeable future.

What we do have, however, is experimental support for SAMs in Scala 2.11.
```scala
scala> trait IntFunction[A] { def apply(i: A): Int }
defined trait IntFunction

scala> def sum[T](as: Traversable[T])(f: IntFunction[T]) = { var sum = 0; as foreach (a => sum += f(a)); sum }
sum: [T](as: Traversable[T])(f: IntFunction[T])Int

scala> sum(List("a", "bc"))(_.length)
res2: Int = 3
```

No boxing is needed here.
