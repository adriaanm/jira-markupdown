(In r24184) After discovering scala/bug#3376 was fixed I gave in and tried to write
a test.  Now that the fiddling is over you can write repl tests
without creating 5000 streams and settings.   Look at
test/files/run/bug3376.scala or jvm/interpreter.scala to see.
Test case closes scala/bug#3376, no review.
