This little poison pill:

{noformat}
val n = 0; for(i <- List(1).par) n
{noformat}

hangs the REPL in 2.9.3, 2.10.3, and 2.11.0-M7.

-Yrepl-sync doesn't help.

The collection type doesn't matter (List, Range, Vector, whatever).

Accessing n in the body is necessary.

Using semicolon to put it all on one line is necessary.
