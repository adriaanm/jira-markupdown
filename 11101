i think the commit that fixed this ticked in 2.12.x is https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3949 (which was merged forward into 2.12.x). The commit was later reverted in 2.11.x due to binary incompatibility (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4048), but the revert was annotated {{[nomerge]}}, which means it was merged into 2.12.x with {{-s ours}}.
