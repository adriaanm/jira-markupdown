Instead of

```scala
def collectFirst[B](pf: PartialFunction[A, B]): Option[B] = {
  for (x <- self.toIterator) { // make sure to use an iterator or `seq`
    if (pf isDefinedAt x)
      return Some(pf(x))
  }
  None
}
```

let's have

```scala
def collectFirst[B](pf: PartialFunction[A, B]): Option[B] = {
  val f = pf.lift
  for (x <- self.toIterator) { // make sure to use an iterator or `seq`
    val result = f(x)
    if (result.isDefined)
      return result
  }
  None
}
```

which I think is no worse for native PartialFunctions and, in the case of PartialFunctions that have been unlifted from A => Option[B]s, calls the underlying function one fewer time.
Dup of #6448, please check the fix for that in 2.11.0-M1 to see if it live up to your expectations.
