Yes, increased code size is the problem. The heuristics built into scalac's inliner are very sensitive to them, preventing inlinings currently done. The non-redundant null-checks, once in place, will most likely be infrequent enough not to increase code size nearly as much. We'll know for sure after the SI-5849 and SI-5852 pending "improvements".
