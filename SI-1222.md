I am having some problems getting past go with calling a .jar+.dll JNI API from Scala.

I have rhapsody.jar and rhapsody.dll installed in the following location:
c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/

I compile x.scala with the command line:
scalac -classpath .;c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/rhapsody.jar ria05.scala

I run gen05.class with the command line:
scala -classpath .;c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/rhapsody.jar -Djava.library.path=c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/ gen05

I get the error:
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no rhapsody in java.library.path
(... etc)

I then copy rhapsody.dll into my Scala project directory and run the same command line:
scala -classpath .;c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/rhapsody.jar -Djava.library.path=c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/ gen05

... and the native method is invoked as expected.

My conclusion is that scala erroneously ignores the -Djava.library.path option.


This issues was created 15 months ago, and I just wanted to point out that while the behavior is different in 2.8, it still isn't good.  Notice how the parameter is specified via the command line, and after the error message stating that '-D' doesn't accept property style arguments, the help documentation within the same output states that is exactly how the input is supposed to be provided.

If the feature is not there, the system shouldn't tell you it is.

'-D' does not accept property style arguments
bad option: '-Ddebug=true'
scala [ <option> ]... [<torun> <arguments>]

All options to scalac are allowed.  See scalac -help.

<torun>, if present, is an object or script file to run.
If no <torun> is present, run an interactive shell.

Option -howtorun allows explicitly specifying how to run <torun>:
    script: it is a script file
    object: it is an object name
    guess: (the default) try to guess

Option -i requests that a file be pre-loaded.  It is only
meaningful for interactive shells.

Option -e requests that its argument be executed as Scala code.

Option -savecompiled requests that the compiled script be saved
for future use.

Option -nocompdaemon requests that the fsc offline compiler not be used.

Option -Dproperty=value sets a Java system property.

(In r20898) Unix scripts pass -D options to the underlying JVM invocation.
