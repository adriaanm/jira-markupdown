(In r24658) Separated abstract and concrete value members in scaladoc.
This looks like such a runaway improvement to me that I'm just
checking it in, but if anyone feels differently say the word.
I eliminated the abstract/concrete filter entirely as it is
extraneous once you can just see which is which.

Closes scala/bug#3831, review by malayeri.
