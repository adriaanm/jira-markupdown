Until v2.6.1, the hierarchy of the Scala distribution on Unix looked as follows:
{code}
scala-2.6.1-final
|-- bin
|   |-- fsc -> ../share/scala/bin/fsc
|   |-- sbaz -> ../share/scala/bin/sbaz
|   |-- sbaz-setup -> ../share/scala/bin/sbaz-setup
|   |-- scala -> ../share/scala/bin/scala
|   |-- scalac -> ../share/scala/bin/scalac
|   |-- scaladoc -> ../share/scala/bin/scaladoc
|   `-- scalap -> ../share/scala/bin/scalap
`-- share
    |-- doc
    |-- man
    `-- scala
{code}
This organisation corresponds to the standard layout of Unix systems,  Mac OS included. Therefore, it was very easy to install Scala using a tool like GNU stow (see http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). For unknown reasons, this organisation changed with 2.7.0 and we now have:
{code}
scala-2.7.0-final
|-- bin
|-- doc
|-- lib
|-- man
|-- meta
|-- misc
`-- src
{code}
This is very annoying as it considerably complicates the installation of Scala on Unix-like systems. I would therefore be happy if the old scheme was restored, or I'd like to hear the motivation for this change. Thanks.
