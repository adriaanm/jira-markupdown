Define the following:

{code}
scala> def get(n: Int) = {
     |   println("Got: " + n)
     |   n
     | }

scala> implicit def pimpInt(n: Int) = new {
     |   def foo = 42
     | }
{code}

Now, when you pimp your `get` function, Scala runs it twice, which is wrong. It seems as if the integer parameter becomes call-by-name even if it isn't defined as such.
{code}
scala> get(96).foo
Got: 96
Got: 96
res13: Int = 42
{code}
