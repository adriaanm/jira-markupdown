The following sample defines two implicit conversions and assumes the first one will be used on the argument of overloaded method "c":

```scala
object Bug {
    
    class A[T]
    class B[T]
    class C
    
    implicit def f(a: A[_]): B[AnyRef] = null
    implicit def g[T <: AnyRef](src: A[T]): B[T] = null
    
    def c[T <: AnyRef](x : B[T]) = null
    def c(x : C) = null
    
    c(null: A[_])
    
}
```

It fails to compile in scala 2.8 with error:

```scala
overloaded method value c with alternatives (x: Bug.C)Null <and> [T <: AnyRef](x: Bug.B[T])Null cannot be applied to (Bug.A[_$$2])
    c(null: A[_])
    ^

```

If we comment out second "c" variant, or "g", the code compiles.
It may be prudent to include:
```scala
val h = null : A[_]
val i : B[AnyRef] = h
```
into the test case, since implicit conversions "f" and "g" currently work as expected on variable assignment. If fixing overloaded methods will somehow mess up variable assignment, you will not know without the aforementioned lines.
(In r23244) closes #3281, #3866. !!! rollback constraints accumulated during isCoercible check. also had to disable clearing of the undoLog.

I don't understand why we had to clear() the undoLog in the first place, since the undoXXX methods increase and decrease its size symmetrically, so the log should always be empty once they have all unwound. Was it a (premature) optimisation or was there some kind of semantic meaning to it that I didn't see?
