See bug #1 in the context of this mailing list post:

"1. It will not choose the correct implicit function for any type after 
the first type in the destination disjunction."

The link below is an improved implementation that has the same bug, is less complex to follow, and thus if I am correct probably demonstrates that the problem is not peculiar to a simulated union type and rather general to implicits and compound type leaf nodes (i.e. those after the first `with`, e.g. the `D[String]` in `D[D[Int] with D[String]]`), when the implicit matching is in the contravariant direction. The `neg` implicit is chosen for `D[D[Int]]` but not for `D[D[String]]`.

Hi Adriaan,

Here is the code example that does not compile.

```scala
class D[-A] (v: A) {
  def get[T <: A] = v match {
    case x: T => x
  }
}

implicit def neg[A](x: A) = new D[D[A]]( new D[A](x) )

def size(t: D[D[Int] with D[String]]) = t

size("")
```

```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : java.lang.String("")
 required: D[D[Int] with D[String]]
       size("")
            ^
```

Note that if we change the last line `size("")` to either of the following, then it does compile.

```scala
size(5)
res0: D[D[Int] with D[String]] = D@77d66

size("hi" : D[D[String]])
res1: D[D[Int] with D[String]] = D@a6bf88
```

So the problem is the implicit is not being found for the 2nd or greater leaf node in the input type, e.g.

```scala
D[D[Int] with D[String]]
```

Please let me know if this is insufficient to reopen this bug, and in such case, what further information you need from me.
I was able to find an alternative formulation for the `size` function, which avoids the bug. But it is less efficient, as it must call the implicit function `neg` twice.

```scala
def size[T](t: T)(implicit d: D[D[T]] <:< D[D[Int] with D[String]]) = (t: D[D[T]]) match {
  case x: D[D[Int]] => x.get[D[Int]].get[Int]
  case x: D[D[String]] => x.get[D[String]].get[String]
}

size(5)
res2: Any = 5

size("hi")
res4: Any = hi

It correctly fails to compile for input types that should not be allowed.

size(5.0)
error: could not find implicit value for parameter d: <:<[D[D[Double]],D[D[Int] with D[String]]]
       size(5.0)
           ^
```
To combine the fix from the other bug report:

https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5549?focusedCommentId=57261&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-57261

```scala
class D[-A] (v: A) { def get = (v : Any) }

class DD[-A >: D[Any]] (v: A) { def get = (v : Any) }

implicit def neg[A](x: A) = new DD[D[A]]( new D[A](x) )

def size[T](t: T)(implicit d: DD[D[T]] <:< DD[D[Int] with D[String]]) = t

scala> size(5)
res0: Int = 5

scala> size("")
res1: java.lang.String = 

scala> size(5.0)
error: could not find implicit value for parameter d: <:<[DD[D[Double]],DD[D[Int] with D[String]]]
       size(5.0)
           ^

scala> size(5.0 : Any)
error: could not find implicit value for parameter d: <:<[DD[D[Any]],DD[D[Int] with D[String]]]
       size(5.0 : Any)
           ^
```
Note the workaround is not a solution for all cases, because this bug infects function definition sites that I can't edit, e.g. the `apply` method of `object Array`.

I was attempting to code with reduced noise and reduced tsuris of **unboxed** disjunctions.

```scala
scala> val test = Array[DD[D[Int] with D[Option[Nothing]]]](None, 1, 2, None, 3)
error: type mismatch;
 found   : None.type (with underlying type object None)
 required: DD[D[Int] with D[Option[Nothing]]]
       val test = Array[DD[D[Int] with D[Option[Nothing]]]](None, 1, 2, None, 3)
                                                            ^

scala> val test = Array[DD[D[Option[Nothing]] with D[Int]]](None, 1, 2, None, 3)
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: DD[D[Option[Nothing]] with D[Int]]
       val test = Array[DD[D[Option[Nothing]] with D[Int]]](None, 1, 2, None, 3)
                                                                  ^
```

I can avoid the bug by verbosely forcing the choice of implicit, thus verifying that this bug is culpable.

```scala
type None = Option[Nothing]

val test = Array[DD[D[None] with D[Int] with D[String]]]( None, 1 : DD[D[Int]], "two" : DD[D[String]] )

scala> test(0).get match {
  case x:D[_] => x.get match {
    case x:None => 1
    case x:Int => 2
    case x:String => 3
    case _ => 4
  }
}
res0: Int = 1

scala> test(1).get match {
  case x:D[_] => x.get match {
    case x:None => 1
    case x:Int => 2
    case x:String => 3
    case _ => 4
  }
}
res1: Int = 2
```

And even if I could edit the `apply` method, the sequence `T*` subsumes to `Any` before the implicit for the workaround is applied. So only the bug fix can help.

{code}def apply[T](xs: T*)(implicit d: DD[D[T]] <:< DD[D[Int] with D[String]]) = xs

scala> apply(1)
res4: Int* = WrappedArray(1)

scala> apply("")
res5: java.lang.String* = WrappedArray()

scala> apply(1, "")
error: could not find implicit value for parameter d: <:<[DD[D[Any]],DD[D[Int] with D[String]]]
       apply(1, "")
            ^
{code}
Perhaps this comment will be getting even further away from the actual bug, which is more general to unification of compound types.

I found a work-around for the prior comment that does not require writing down the types for each literal element.

```scala
type None = Option[Nothing]

class DArray[T >: D[Any]](val len: Int) {
  var array = new Array[DD[T]](len)
  var length = 0
  def apply[A](v: A)(implicit d: DD[D[A]] <:< DD[T]): DArray[T] = {
    array(length) = v : DD[D[A]]
    length += 1
    this
  }
}

val test = new DArray[D[None] with D[Int] with D[String]](3)

scala> test(None).apply(1).apply("two").array
res0: Array[DD[D[None] with D[Int] with D[String]]] = Array(DD@179eb02, DD@133e7a1, DD@ac0b08)
```

I was trying for a more concise version of the code below, but it can not be used because [issue SI-6630](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6630) is not a bug.

```scala
scala> test(None)(1)("two")
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: <:<[DD[D[object scala.None]],DD[D[None] with D[Int] with D[String]]]
       test(None)(1)("two")
                  ^
```
