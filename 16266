This was also brought up on the mailing list:

One can't use zipped in for-comprehensions:

  for ((x,y,z) <- (xs,ys,zs).zipped) yield ...

TupleN.zip - which *does* do the right thing - was deprecated by zipped.

Current workaround is to define a bunch of our own zip methods.

It would also be great to have this defined for TupleN for N > 3.
