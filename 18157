I started with the following two methods:
```java
def getName: String = getString match {
  case None => return ""
  case Some(str) => return str
}

def getString: Option[String] = Some("abc")
```

Then I changed the first method to
```java
lazy val getName: String = getString match {
  case None => return ""
  case Some(str) => return str
}
```

Unfortunately, I forgot to remove the return statement. In this case, scala compiler should stop with the message "return outside method definition", but what it really did was:

error: uncaught exception during compilation: java.lang.NullPointerException
