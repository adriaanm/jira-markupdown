=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===
If you create a windows batch file containing a scala program and try to pass arguments containing parentheses, an error is reported.

Create, for instance, a batch file printargs.bat that contains a scala program that just prints the arguments:
{code}
::#!
@echo off
scala %0 %*
goto :eof
::!#
args foreach println
{code} 
If you call it like that, the windows command line interpreter reports a syntax error:
{code}
printargs.bat "foo(bar)baz"
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
It should print 
{code}
foo(bar)baz
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===
A syntax error in scala.bat at the line
{code}
  set _ARGS=%*
{code}


=== Additional information ===

If you change scala.bat such that it passes %* directly to the java call, instead of trying to put the content into a local variable, the problem disappears. So I suggest that scala.bat should be refactored to avoid using the _ARGS variable when it is not necessary.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_21-b07
  - Operating system: Windows XP
Solution in SI-7293 / SI-7295.
Merging with SI-7295, for which I've just submitted a fix.
