Its not a plugin problem but a compiler problem. Here is my somewhat simpler sample:
```scala
package test

object test {
  case class Foo[T,T2](f : (T,T2) => String) extends (((T,T2)) => String){
    def apply(t : T) = (s:T2) => f(t,s)
    def apply(p : (T,T2)) = f(p._1,p._2)
  }
  implicit def g[T](f : (T,String) => String) = Foo(f)
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    val f = (x:Int,s:String) => s + x
    println(f(1))
    ()
  }
}
```

Code will run with a stack overflow error. Note that Foo has two apply/1 methods, I suspect that is what is driving the implicit lookup mechanism crazy. The bug doesn't occur unless we actually extend Function1 and an implicit conversion is involved.

Re-assigning to Martin.
