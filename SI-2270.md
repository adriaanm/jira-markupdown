Currently when you visit the page of a package (<package-name>$$content.html) it is very difficult to quickly get an overview of the package's contents. The documentation details of each class, trait and object appear in the class and object summary tables obfuscating the page.

I believe that scaladoc should only include the first sentence of each class/trait/object level scaladoc comment in the class and object summary tables.

Please note that this is the behavior that javadoc has.
This is a duplicate of SI-224. Enhancement SI-224 was closed but it is not implemented correctly. The method that needs to change is {{def shortComment(cmnt: Comment): NodeSeq}} in ModelToXML.scala
Fix for SI-2270
