When trying to compile my code with fsc, half the time the compiler complains about a compilation error caused by type erasure, and the other half it gives a null pointer exception during specialization. I've attached a log of the crash. It can be worked around by compiling again (the bug only appears every other time). The bug also occurs in RC1. I haven't tested earlier versions.

This is my first time submitting a bug report, so I apologize if I made any mistakes.
I've just been working on #8871 and have found an important fix for specialization and the REPL / FSC. Hopefully that will fix your problem, but without a reproducible test case, I'll have to mark this bug as incomplete.
