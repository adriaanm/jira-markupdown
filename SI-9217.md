The following example is *not* deemed ambiguous by the compiler, nor does it resolve to the most specific one.

{code:Scala}
class P(val i: Int) { override def toString() = s"$i" }
class C(j: Int) extends P(j)

trait PrecisionTest {

  implicit val p = new P(1)
  implicit val c = new C(2)
}

object Main extends App with PrecisionTest {
  println(implicitly[P])
  // prints: 2
}
{code}

The spec says: 

{quote}
If there are several eligible arguments which match the implicit parameter's type, a most specific one will be chosen using the rules of static overloading resolution. If the parameter has a default argument and no implicit argument can be found the default argument is used
{quote}

As far as I know, c is *not* more specific then p in this case with respect to the usage.

Edit: removed nonsensical example

See the definition of "as specific as" in [the spec|http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#overloading-resolution]. In your comparison example, it picks the f that applies.
Probably you want to ask on the ML, where there are more brains listening, and where the chat doesn't corrupt the JIRA stream, which is already polluted by trivial edits etc. In fact, maybe ask on scala-language. I can say c is chosen simply because C conforms to P but not vice-versa.

Usually, if C adds something that P doesn't have, even if I'm shopping for a P, if I see a C, I go, hey, that might be useful, and it's the same price! Then I buy the C.

I think that is how Apple sells iPhones, where
{noformat}
typeOf[iPhone6] <:< typeOf[iPhone5]
{noformat}
except for the part about price.
