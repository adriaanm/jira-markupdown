I can't reproduce this with the latest plugin nightly build, but I have seen something similar when doing plugin development and the Scala plugins fail during the startup of an Eclipse runtime workbench.

Is there anything you can tell me about your setup? Was this during a long-running Eclipse session or immediately after startup?
