I'm sorry, even this little patch causes the breakage.  I thought I had confirmed otherwise, but the full clean-rebuild cycle takes a long time.  Here is what happens:
{code}
[scalacfork] /soft/lang/scala/scala/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/symtab/Symbols.scala:623: error: type mismatch;
[scalacfork]  found   : Symbols.this.InfoTransformer
[scalacfork]  required: Symbols.this.InfoTransformer{def changesBaseClasses: Boolean(true)}
[scalacfork]               infoTransformers = itr; // caching optimization
{code}
