=== How to reproduce ===
Try to compile the code given in {{LoggedNodeFactory}}'s scaladoc:

```scala
 object testLogged extends Application {
   val x = new scala.xml.nobinding.NoBindingFactoryAdapter
         with scala.xml.LoggedNodeFactory[scala.xml.Elem]()
         with scala.util.logging.ConsoleLogger;
   Console.println("Start");
   val doc = x.loadXML(new org.xml.sax.InputSource("http://lamp.epfl.ch/~buraq"));
   Console.println("End");
   Console.println(doc);
 }
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

It will compile.

=== What do you see instead? ===

It gives

```scala
<console>:3: error: traits or objects may not have parameters
                with scala.xml.LoggedNodeFactory[scala.xml.Elem]()
                                                                ^
```

and, upon removing the extraneous `()`, it then gives

```scala
<console>:6: error: value nobinding is not a member of package xml
          val x = new scala.xml.nobinding.NoBindingFactoryAdapter
                                ^
```

=== Additional information ===

Example extracted from today (15/12/2010) nightly's scaladoc. I have no experience with the classes involved here, so I have no idea whether the problem is trivial or not.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:  2.9.0.r0-b20101211173807
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_19
  - Operating system: Windows Vista 64 bits
(In r24310) Cleaned up some horribly rotted xml doc comments.  Made LoggedNodeFactory
a trait so it had a chance of being mixed into another class as directed in
the doc comment in question.  Closes #4087, no review.
