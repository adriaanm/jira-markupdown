Here's a smaller minimization:
```scala
object X {
  implicitly[com.nicta.scoobi.core.WireFormat[Nothing]]
}
```

`-Xlog-implicits` shows that we are cutting off lots of divergent nested implicit searches. We tread a fairly perilous path with divergent implicits, it seems in this case we are too lenient and should call the whole search off rather than continuing. But it is hard to be sure about what's going on without first creating a smaller set of implicits that demonstrates the essense of Scoobi's `WireFormat` and `AvroSchema` implicits.

I remember that these implicits were involved in another compilation speed problem I spent some time on: https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/pull/324

AFAICT, this behaviour isn't a regression from 2.11.5, so I'm demoting it as a blocker for 2.11.6.
