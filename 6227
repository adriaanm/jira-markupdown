The value for x is inlined into the accessor method, which leads to the field never getting assigned.  So the -Xcheckinit result is actually correct: it is indeed uninitialized, it's just that nobody was ever going to look at it until -Xcheckinit poked his nose in.

If we just didn't generate the field as discussed in scala/bug#4605 then this would take care of itself.
