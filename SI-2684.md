It would be nice support for frameworks that using things like ASM to do introspection at the bytecode level if abstract methods included the debug info in a fake body to carry the parameter names just like concrete methods. Java does NOT do this, either but if it could be done without affecting Java compatibility it would be a nice improvement.

(It turns out I use such a framework and for it to function with Java interfaces I have to create a boilerplate implementation of the interface into a concrete class with implementations that just throw UnsupportedOperationException() but use the same parameter names and then get the framework to look at that class when introspecting for the interface so it can actually build up the parameter name data structure it wants. I would LOVE to be able to use Scala traits like Java interfaces in this case except without the need for the boilerplate companion class to get the parameter names into the bytecode so they can be read out.)

Here is an example (Trait.scala)

{code}

trait Trait {
  def f(a: String)
}

abstract class Abstract extends Trait {
  def g(b: String)
}

abstract class Concrete extends Abstract with Trait {
  def f(a: String) { println("Hi") }
  def g(b: String) { println("Howdy") }
}
{code}

So it would be nice if the initial abstract definitions of f() and g() contained the same debug info in a synthetic degenerate implementation that the concrete implementations in Concrete do so a framework that was introspecting bytecode could associate the parameter names with the parameters of f() and g() having only seen the trait / abstract class definitions.

But, this is what we get:

{code}
$$ ~/Downloads/scala-2.7.7.final/bin/scalac Trait.scala 
{code}

Here is the Trait:

{code}
$$ javap -l -classpath . Trait
Compiled from "Trait.scala"
public interface Trait{
public abstract void f(java.lang.String);



}
{code}

and here is the abstract class

{code}
$$ javap -l -classpath . Abstract
Compiled from "Trait.scala"
public abstract class Abstract extends java.lang.Object implements Trait,scala.ScalaObject{
public Abstract();
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 6: 0



public abstract void g(java.lang.String);



public int $$tag()   throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 6: 0



}
{code}

and finally, here is the concrete class, which does what we like:

{code}
$$ javap -l -classpath . Concrete
Compiled from "Trait.scala"
public abstract class Concrete extends Abstract implements Trait,scala.ScalaObject{
public Concrete();
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 10: 0



public void g(java.lang.String);
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 12: 0

  LocalVariableTable: 
   Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
   0      9      0    this       LConcrete;
   0      9      1    b       Ljava/lang/String;


public void f(java.lang.String);
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 11: 0

  LocalVariableTable: 
   Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
   0      9      0    this       LConcrete;
   0      9      1    a       Ljava/lang/String;


}
{code}
