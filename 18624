Try compiling the attached projects (which contains just 3 simple class decls) results in the following error:

{code}
/Users/mirco/Projects/fail/src/main/scala/foo/bar/Bar.scala:3: object MyBuz is not a member of package foo.bar.buz
[error] import buz.MyBuz
{code}

It took me a while to realize that I need to prefix my import with `_root_`, which made me wondering if the error message could be improved, something like {{Maybe you wanted to import _root_.buz.MyBuz at line Y}} would be of great help, if possible.
