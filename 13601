The following code
```scala
var x = 0
x += n
```

produces this error message:
```scala
error: value += is not a member of Int
```

It would be better if it could state that `n` is not defined.

However:
```scala
var x = 0
x += ""
```

gives the same error message. Some information of the expected type of += would be nice as a well as a hint that <ins>= might be rewritten in terms of </ins> and =.
