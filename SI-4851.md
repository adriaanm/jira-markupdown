I have this piece of code

{code}
trait Bound {
  private val support = new PropertyChangeSupport()
  
  def firePropertyChange(name:String, oldVal:Object, newVal:Object) = support.firePropertyChange(name, oldVal, newVal)
}
{code}

I realized that I used a constructor which is NOT present in the java class. How is that possible ? A decompile yielded:

{code}
    public static void $init$(Bound $this)
    {
        $this.scala$test$Bound$_setter_$scala$test$Bound$$support_$eq(new PropertyChangeSupport(BoxedUnit.UNIT));
    }
{code}

So it seems the compiler tried to match the Object constructor with a default unit. Is this the proper behavior ?
How can a programmer know that this substitution is happening ?

It is very, very unfortunate behavior.  As specified.

See this [thread|http://www.scala-lang.org/node/6982].

Leaving this open anyway.
Now that's a great point.  What are the odds someone wants to implicitly pass BoxedUnit to a *java* class? The world hasn't gone that mad.
(extempore in [r25410|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25410]) Added two new compiler options:

  -Ywarn-adapted-args   // also included in -Xlint
  -Yno-adapted-args

The former warns when a () is inserted or an argument list is implicitly
tupled. The latter errors under the same conditions. Using these options
I found several bugs in the distribution which would otherwise be nearly
impossible to spot. These bugs were innocuous (I think) but similar bugs
could easily be (and have been) otherwise.

Certain particularly threatening scenarios are at minimum warned about
regardless of options given.  Closes SI-4851, no review.
