This compiles under 2.9.1, but under trunk:
```scala
abstract class FileOps {
  def withLock[R](start: Long = 0): Option[R]
}

trait DefaultFileOps {
  self: DefaultPath =>
  
  override def withLock[R](start: Long = 5): Option[R] = None
}

class DefaultPath extends FileOps with DefaultFileOps { }
```
```
bip.scala:11: error: overriding method withLock$default$1 in class FileOps of type [R]=> Long;
 method withLock$default$1 in trait DefaultFileOps of type [R]=> Long needs `override' modifier
class DefaultPath extends FileOps with DefaultFileOps { }
      ^
one error found
```
(extempore in [r25979](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25979)) Fix for regression in overriding with defaults.

I should know better than to behave as if usable inferences can
be drawn from a comment like "SYNTHETIC because of DEVIRTUALIZE".
Maybe it was even true when it was written, but no more.
Closes #5178, no review.
That would be great! I was just putting it back the way it was before I regressed it, because this was preventing me from building scala-io.  However I don't know what the correct flags are.  (The default getters should inherit more flags from the relevant methods?)
we cannot assign the correct `OVERRIDE` flags to default getters. one and the same default getter might sometimes override another one, sometimes not, example below.

this is a consequence of the fact that we allow overriding defaults without `override` modifiers.

so the fix in [9f9932bd20](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/9f9932bd20) is left in place, a comment is added in [5d90d00108](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5d90d00108)

```scala
trait A1 { def f(x: Int): Int }
trait A2 extends A1 { def f(x: Int = 1): Int }

trait B { self: A1 =>
  def f(x: Int = 2): Int = x
}

object t {
  new A1 with B // here, B.f$default$1 should not have an 'override' flag
  new A2 with B // here, B.f$default$1 would need an 'override' flag
}
```
