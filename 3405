Your bug isn't going to get any attention if you present it in this form.

In your comment scala/bug#5 you imply that you've been able to reproduce the problem using the command line tools only. If that's the case then you should be able to extract a small self-contained example, ideally a single source file with no external dependencies, which reproduces the problem with command line scalac. Please provide that if possible. Thanks.
