How are entire classes missing from the generated documentation? Try to find scala.reflect.Manifest:

http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html

Please don't anyone band-aid Manifest without determining how this can happen at all.  When I build scaladoc there is no warning or error given which has any applicability to Manifest, yet there is no Manifest.
```scala
% find build/scaladoc/ -name '*Manifest*'
build/scaladoc//library/scala/collection/generic/ClassManifestTraversableFactory$$GenericCanBuildFrom.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/collection/generic/ClassManifestTraversableFactory.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/collection/generic/GenericClassManifestCompanion.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/collection/generic/GenericClassManifestTraversableTemplate.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/reflect/ClassManifest$$.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/reflect/ClassManifest.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/reflect/NoManifest$$.html
build/scaladoc//library/scala/reflect/OptManifest.html
```
Setting to high priority, we can't have holes like this.
