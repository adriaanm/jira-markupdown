FWIW, here's an instance in the real world where the behavior did cause some confusion:

https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issues/42

The library authors reacted quickly by changing the parameter type from being the by-name `=> Boolean` to being an unambiguous function type `() => Boolean`, but I wonder what other code uses it. I would personally appreciate a warning in those cases, especially because blocks passed to by-name parameters *do* exhibit the intuitive behavior when there's no implicit conversion.
