I use spring mvc to create the controllers.
Every thing is ok, but some parameters have been rename after compile in somes method of my controllers.

I found that in debug mode of idea
{code:title=TravelSheetController.scala|borderStyle=solid}
@RequestMapping(value = Array(""), method = Array(RequestMethod.GET))
@ResponseBody
def query(
        @RequestParam(value="start", defaultValue="0") start:Int,
        @RequestParam(value="limit", defaultValue="10") limit:Int,
        @RequestParam(required = false) startDate: String,
        @RequestParam(required = false) endDate: String,
        @RequestParam(defaultValue="0") driverId: Long): PaginationBase[TravelSheetDto] = {
       // ignore code
}
{code}
the {color:red}driverId{color} is rename to {color:red}driverId$1{color}, So I cannot receive the value from spring mvc.

Here's a minimal reproduction by Jason Zaugg:

```
scala> class T { def foo(a: Int) = () => a }
defined class T

scala> :javap -v T
Compiled from "<console>"
...
public scala.Function0 foo(int);
  Code:
   Stack=4, Locals=2, Args_size=2
   0:   new     #7; //class T$$anonfun$foo$1
   3:   dup
   4:   aload_0
   5:   iload_1
   6:   invokespecial   #12; //Method T$$anonfun$foo$1."<init>":(LT;I)V
   9:   areturn
  LineNumberTable:
   line 7: 0

  LocalVariableTable:
   Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
   0      10      0    this       LT;
   0      10      1    a$1       I
```
It's a bug.  It happens during lambdalift, and it tries to avoid it.  Look at the eerie similarity of the example in the comment.
```scala
beforePickler {
  // The param symbol in the MethodType should not be renamed, only the symbol in scope. This way,
  // parameter names for named arguments are not changed. Example: without cloning the MethodType,
  //     def closure(x: Int) = { () => x }
  // would have the signature
  //     closure: (x$1: Int)() => Int
  if (sym.isParameter && sym.owner.info.paramss.exists(_ contains sym))
    sym.owner modifyInfo (_ cloneInfo sym.owner)
}
```

SI-6028 Restore original parameter names after lambdalift

Extends what was being done only in the pickled signatures to
the bytecode proper. Once the code has been lifted out of a tree,
we can undo the mangling in that tree.

This only does this for parameter name, but I suspect it could and
should be done for all symbols, which will present a few less mangled
 names in the debugger.

Do we have any test infrastructure for verifying this? Can we compare
-Xprint:lambdalift against a checkfile?
```
I went further and restored the names of all symbols captured by lifted free variables.

BTW, a workaround is to use `@RequestParam("paramName")` to explicitly bind the parameter to a name.
