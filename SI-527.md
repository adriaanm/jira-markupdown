How do I create a serializable anonymous class? [[BR]]
The following code:
```scala
def fingerprint () = new @serializable java.io.Serializable {val nodeId = bannerNodeId}
```
produces a warning and still throws an
```scala
java.io.NotSerializableException: ...$$$$anon$$11
```
at runtime.

It would be best if Scala compiler would've understood the java.io.Serializable signature and respected it...

That might also mean making pointers to the parent environment *transient*!
