We don't have one. I would recommend to serialize access to the reflection API in your own code (perhaps wrap it in a actor), and to avoid using TypeTags anywhere as a context bound. We'll have more news on this ticket by August after our next attempt to synchronize things.

Remember that reflection is an *experimental* API, so you shouldn't be building production systems on it unless you are aware of the risks.
