See also SI-5082. My proposed patch for it happens to reverse this regression.

Pattern matching, which bypasses the synthesized `unapply` method seems, superficially, to be immune. I seem to remember some code in there that corrected for out-of-order case accessors, but I can't find it. It does use {{caseAccessors}} when producing counter-examples, which may be subject to this bug, too.
{code}
      override protected def tupleSel(binder: Symbol)(i: Int): Tree = { import CODE._
        // caseFieldAccessors is messed up after typers (reversed, names mangled for non-public fields)
        // TODO: figure out why...
        val accessors = binder.caseFieldAccessors
        // luckily, the constrParamAccessors are still sorted properly, so sort the field-accessors using them
        // (need to undo name-mangling, including the sneaky trailing whitespace)
        val constrParamAccessors = binder.constrParamAccessors
{code}
{code}
    val originalAccessors = clazz.caseFieldAccessors
    // private ones will have been renamed -- make sure they are entered
    // in the original order.
    def accessors = clazz.caseFieldAccessors sortBy { acc =>
      originalAccessors indexWhere { orig =>
        (acc.name == orig.name) || (acc.name startsWith (orig.name append "$"))
      }
    }
