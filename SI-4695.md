Multiple issues here.  (And that's before I get to the question of whether one's companion object can be a package object -- although I assume the answer is "no", I find nothing unambiguous in the spec.)

```
package foo

class Bar { }
package object Bar { }
```

1) Non-idempotence of source compilation
2) Classes not even on the classpath fail the compilation

```
// first time it compiles, second time it doesn't.
% scalac3 p.scala 
% scalac3 p.scala 
p.scala:1: error: package foo contains object and package with same name: Bar
one of them needs to be removed from classpath
package foo
        ^
one error found

// it will not compile as long as those classfiles are visible from the
// current directory, even though "." is explicitly unreferenced.
% scalac3 -d /tmp -cp /asldkfjlasdfj p.scala 
p.scala:1: error: package foo contains object and package with same name: Bar
one of them needs to be removed from classpath
package foo
        ^
one error found

// delete them, it compiles.
% rm -rf foo
% scalac3 -d /tmp -cp /asldkfjlasdfj p.scala 
%
```

Edit: Another, possibly more serious, related issue follows.  Example from mark harrah.
```
// demo/A.scala containing:
package demo
trait A

// demo/package.scala
package object demo extends demo.A

#!/usr/bin/env bash
#

rm -rf ./build
mkdir build
scalac -d build -cp build demo/A.scala demo/package.scala
rm -f build/demo/A.class
scalac -d build -cp build demo/A.scala demo/package.scala
```
It fails even when given all the source files it has just compiled:
```
error: error while loading demo, class file needed by package is missing.
reference type A of package demo refers to nonexisting symbol.
one error found
```
This crash was more interesting before it was minimized; it's the same example, with the twist that if you compile the package object first, then compile the class with the same name, you get:
```scala
how can getCommonSuperclass() do its job if different class symbols get the same bytecode-level internal name: top/baz/package$

It must be serious when the message is a rhetorical question.
Regarding the case that I've seen a lot in practice:

```scala
package object demo extends demo.A
```

Martin suggests that if we took a strict approach we would outlaw this with a cyclic reference error, as it is conceptually the same manner as:

```scala
scala> object demo extends demo.A {
     |   trait A
     | }
<console>:7: error: illegal cyclic reference involving object demo
       object demo extends demo.A {
                           ^
```

This would break quite a lot of code, as nested types in the package are the most appealing for the package object to inherit. So we would have to deprecate it, or just leave it in a "use-at-your-own-risk" zone. We can tailor the error message for package objects to suggest a clean build.

However, if there is enough will to make this work, there might be a way. In this patch, I detect if any parents of a package module loaded from a classfile is missing (ie, is a stub symbol). If so, we pretend that we didn't see the package.class at all. At the conclusion of the run, we can check that the a package module we discarded was indeed reconstructed from sources.

I'm going to sit on this one for a while; comments are very welcome.
If it helps add context, I put my sbt package object in the final subproject that aggregates everything.  So, I'm personally ok with a restriction that the contents of `package object x` are not visible within `x`.  I realize that this is probably a common use case in practice (if I remember correctly, my example above was a minimization of a user's code), but I figured I'd mention it as how I deal with package objects.  It has the drawback that I haven't figured out how to build scaladoc that includes the package object (introduces cycles).
