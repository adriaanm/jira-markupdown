i should point out that this is not such a synthetically constructed case. here is an example usage from my DSL
```scala
      play( server, out ) {
         val ply = PlayBuf.ar( numChannels, id, BufRateScale.kr( id ), loop = if( loop ) 1 else 0 )
         if( !loop ) FreeSelfWhenDone.kr( ply )
         ply * "amp".kr( amp )
      }
```

now this failed to work, because PlayBuf was early constructed out of the Graph context:
```scala
object DSL {
   implicit def thunkToGraphFunction[ T <% GE ]( thunk: => T ) = new GraphFunction( thunk )
   def play( target: Node = Server.default.defaultGroup, outBus: Int = 0,
             fadeTime: Option[Float] = Some( 0.02f ),
             addAction: AddAction = addToHead )( f: GraphFunction[ _ ]) : Synth =
      f.play( target, outBus, fadeTime, addAction )
}
```

note that GE is a trait to which different graph elements can be converted, e.g. number literals, a Seq[ GE ], but also the ugens like PlayBuf.

*but*, if i do instead:
```scala
object DSL {
   ...
   def play( target: Node = Server.default.defaultGroup, outBus: Int = 0,
             fadeTime: Option[Float] = Some( 0.02f ),
             addAction: AddAction = addToHead )( thunk: => GE ) : Synth =
      new GraphFunction( thunk ).play( target, outBus, fadeTime, addAction )
```

it suddenly works, the thunk is not prematurely evaluated. this is clearly inconsistent, and for the sake of DSL building, i think the implicit def thunkToGraphFunction should work exactly the same. Here is another example which *does* work:
```scala
   {
      val ply = PlayBuf.ar( numChannels, id, BufRateScale.kr( id ), loop = if( loop ) 1 else 0 )
      if( !loop ) FreeSelfWhenDone.kr( ply )
      ply * "amp".kr( amp )
   }.play( s, 0 )
```

so this last example is implicitly converted to GraphFunction (which has the play method) and the thunk captures everything inside the curly braces, not just the last line (ply * "amp".kr( amp ))...
