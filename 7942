Greg and I were checking this out and saw that there was another issue with:
```scala
trait Foo[@specialized(AnyRef, Int) A, @specialized(Boolean) B] {
  def apply(x: A): B
}


abstract class Inter extends Foo[String, Boolean]


class Baz extends Inter {
  def apply(x: String) = false
}
```

The `apply$mcLZ$sp` was not getting specialized in `Baz`, but just retained the bridge to `apply`. This should work now.


Here's the relevant commit:
