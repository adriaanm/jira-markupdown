It's pretty obvious that `Seq#toSet` is going to recreate the entire collection.  It's much less obvious that `Set#toSet` will.  That `SortedSet.toSet` is broken is evidence of that.  I think the solution is to add a protected abstract method that you override to indicate whether it can be covariant or not.  Not pretty, but less bad I guess than the alternatives.
