Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-M6 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_33).

scala> def foo(xs: Array[String]) = xs.to[Vector]
<console>:7: warning: Could not inline required method canBuildFrom because access level required by callee not matched by caller.
       def foo(xs: Array[String]) = xs.to[Vector]
                                         ^
foo: (xs: Array[String])Vector[String]
```

what's the warning about?
Before inliner:
```
  def main(args: Array[String] (ARRAY[REF(class String)])): Unit {
  locals: value args
  startBlock: 1
  blocks: [1]
  
  1: 
    5	LOAD_MODULE object Predef
    5	LOAD_LOCAL(value args)
    5	CHECK_CAST ARRAY[REF(class Object)]
    5	CALL_METHOD scala.Predef.refArrayOps (dynamic)
    5	LOAD_MODULE object Vector
    5	CALL_METHOD scala.collection.immutable.Vector.canBuildFrom (dynamic)
    5	CALL_METHOD scala.collection.TraversableLike.to (dynamic)
    5	DROP REF(class Object)
    5	RETURN(UNIT)
    
  }
```

The warning results from `Vector.canBuildFrom` being marked `@inline`, and also because it accesses a private member of `Vector` as `-Yinline-warnings -Ylog:inliner` reports:

```
[log inliner] instruction CALL_METHOD scala.collection.immutable.Vector.VectorReusableCBF (static-instance) requires private access.
```



I'm puzzled by the "Not a Bug" response. Surely there is **something** here requiring fixing â€” if not in the optimizer, then in the standard library.

Are you implying that the @inline annotation should be removed from Vector.canBuildFrom?
It's a tradeoff:
- Given unchanged source code, the inliner is doing its job alright.
- Assuming the body of `Vector.canBuildFrom` is rewritten (into what?) then the pros and cons of its inlining could be weighed. 
- Removing the `@inline` annotation is another option. In this case, invocations at points where `VectorReusableCBF` is also accessible lose their inlining ability. (I haven't checked whether there are any).

That's a design discussion, suitable for the mailing list, not this bug ticket, I think.
This bug remains closed, found additional information on how the "Can't inline" started appearing:
