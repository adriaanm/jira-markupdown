Would it be possible to include that change for the upcoming Scala 2.9.3 packages?

While having a fix in Scala 2.10.0 is nice, a fixed package for Scala 2.9.x would be appreciated very much.

I think renaming the {{jline.jar}} file to {{scala-jline.jar}} would be the easiest way to fix the problem with duplicate files.
