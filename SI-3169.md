I have attached a patch that uses a mutable HashMap keyed on a tuple using Int AND MC rather than the original array. This may be naive regarding the use of a Mutable HashMap -- I'm not clear what all the impacts might be (say on performance, thread-safety, etc.).

Until a fix is incorporated, consider using the apply(MathContext) method on the BigDecimal class to convert the BigDecimal with the right MathContext.
Replying to [comment:3 imaier]:

Can you elaborate on that? I introduced all the math context code, because it was pretty useless without the ability to specify it.  You can see in #1812 some talk about how to integrate it, with the other party in the discussion wanting it even more tightly integrated.  (And I'm not sure I disagree, I just haven't had time to come back to it.)
