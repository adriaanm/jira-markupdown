I noticed that this error seems to be related to annotations. For instance, code in `ProductN.scala` (where I see this exception thrown quite often) has the following declaration:

{code}
  @throws(classOf[IndexOutOfBoundsException])
  override def productElement(n: Int) = n match { 
..
{code}

and `throws` takes a default argument:

{code}
class throws[T <: Throwable](cause: String = "") extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation {
{code}
