I just tried building sbt with Scala 2.11.0-M8 and I got:

{code}
[error] /Users/grek/scala/xsbt/main/actions/src/main/scala/sbt/compiler/Eval.scala:362: value toArray is not a member of Eval.this.global.Range

{code}

I've been scratching my head for a while but then it became clear what happened. The code in {{Eval.scala}} refers to {{scala.Range}} (without any explicit import). Now, for reason I didn't identify yet there's Range class mixed into {{Global}} name space. Compare:

{code}
// Scala 2.10.2
scala> val globalTpe = typeOf[Global]
globalTpe: $r.intp.global.Type = scala.tools.nsc.Global

scala> globalTpe.member("Range": TypeName)
res5: $r.intp.global.Symbol = <none>

// Scala 2.11.0-M8
scala> val globalTpe = typeOf[Global]
globalTpe: $r.intp.global.Type = scala.tools.nsc.Global

scala> globalTpe.member("Range": TypeName)
res12: $r.intp.global.Symbol = class Range

scala> res12.fullName
res13: String = scala.reflect.internal.Positions.Range
{code}

That class shadows (through {{globa._}} import) the one previously used.
I can't spot the connection between the change in Slick you linked to and this ticket.

Do we want to rename the class or refactor the code so it's not private anymore?

If it's true that c4341385629bd114b61c55103f1d83f26dce22f9 introduced regression how's possible that I report it 11 months later? Could it be that nobody tried to compile or never got to compiling sbt's {{main}} subproject during last 11 months?
I can't actually reproduce the problem as I don't know where to find releases of sbinary for M8.

I used this minimization:

{code}
object Test {
  val g: scala.tools.nsc.Global = ???

  import g._

  def foo(r: Range) = r: scala.Range
}
{code}

Which starts giving the same error as your report when `Range` was added to a supertype of `Global`.

But something still doesn't add up.
I built sbinary against M8 locally. I summed up steps necessary to reproduce here: https://gist.github.com/gkossakowski/8940448

When it comes to nightly builds, this one build only subset of Sbt that constitutes incremental compiler (and it's dependencies), see the following log entry:
{code}
[info] The following subprojects will be built in project sbt: control, io, process, interface, logging, api, relation, classfile, launcher-interface, classpath, incremental-compiler, persist, launcher, compiler-interface, compile, compiler-integration
{code}

See also the dbuild [definition|https://github.com/typesafehub/sbt-builds-for-ide/blob/master/sbt-all-nightly-on-2.11.x#L65]:
{code}
{
        name:   "sbt",
        uri:    "git://github.com/sbt/sbt.git#0.13"
        extra: {
          sbt-version: "0.13.0",
          projects: ["compiler-interface",
                     "classpath","logging","io","control","classfile",
                     "process","relation","interface","persist","api",
                     "compiler-integration","incremental-compiler","compile","launcher-interface"
                    ],
          run-tests: false,
          commands: [ "set every Util.includeTestDependencies := false" // Without this, we have to build specs2
                    ]
        }
      }
{code}

In retrospect, it looks like the choice of names for jenkins jobs and configuration files was a bit unfortunate.
