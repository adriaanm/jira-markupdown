While scala/bug#400 is fixed, here is another related problem. Again, two Java classes but this time with two constructors:
```scala
public class Par<T> {}

public class Foo {
  public Foo(Par p) {} // note the raw type
  public Foo(String s) {}
}
```

The constructor that takes a Par cannot be resolved:
```scala
new Foo(new Par[Int])
```

gives
```scala
overloaded method constructor Foo with alternatives (java.lang.String)Foo <and> (Par)Foo cannot be applied to (Par[Int])
```

It works when the parameter type is changed from Par to Par<?>
