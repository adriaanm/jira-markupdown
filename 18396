See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-user/v-SoFtK8y3Q for the issue and the discussion raised by Matt Zimmer:
```
Is the behavior of ++ defined for duplicate insertions?

- The current behavior of ++ is like + is specified to be, but since ++ is not documented to be that way, I view this as unreliable.

- Given that it seems like an oversight, and I'm encountering this now, I'm hoping someone on this list knows if that is the case and what the intended behavior is, until the documentation can be fixed.
```
