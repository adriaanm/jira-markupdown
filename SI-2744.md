Hmm ... some misunderstanding here. I thought you were proposing some extended Scala/PDE functionality ... hence me asking you to open an enhancement ticket.

Class files generated from Scala sources should be being included in plugins exported by the PDE. If they aren't then that's a bug (ie. SI-1919). If you can reproduce the problem on trunk then please comment there.

If there isn't any actual enhancement being proposed then I'll close this ticket.
