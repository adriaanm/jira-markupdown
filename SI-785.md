This is both a report of a defect in the specification and a
minor enhancement request for the implementation.

GADT-style dependent case analysis works for objects:

```scala
scala> trait T[X]
defined trait T

scala> object O extends T[int]
defined module O

scala> def f[X] : T[X] => X = { case O => 42 }
f: [X](T[X]) => X
```

O is syntactically a stable identifier pattern (8.1.4), but
dependent case analysis isn't defined for them in section 8.3 of
the specification. Their treatment seems straightforwardly
analogous to the treatment of constructor patterns, though: {
case O => 42 } just gets translated to { case _ : O.type => 42 }.
This description is currently missing from the specification.

Moreover, it seems that with the current implementation, the
above rule only works for objects, not for other stable
identifiers.

```scala
scala> val V = new T[int] {}
V: java.lang.Object with T[int] = $$anon$$1@23194cf5

scala> def g[X] : T[X] => X = { case V => 42 }
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(42)
 required: X
       def g[X] : T[X] => X = { case V => 42 }
```

Still, manual translation to a type pattern works all right:

```scala
scala> def g[X] : T[X] => X = { case _ : V.type => 42 }
g: [X](T[X]) => X

scala> g(V)
res1: int = 42
```

This seems inconsistent. I very much think all stable identifiers
should be treated uniformly. My immediate motivation for this is
that it makes writing a typecase somewhat neater. Given:

```scala
val IntC = classOf[Int]
val StringC = classOf[String]
```

Currently one has to write:

```scala
def g[X] : Class[X] => X = { 
   case _ : IntC.type => 42
   case _ : StringC.type => "forty-two" 
}
```

Instead of the prettier:

```scala
def g[X] : Class[X] => X = { 
   case IntC => 42
   case StringC => "forty-two" 
}
```
All right, this is a bigger mess than I first thought. A number of issues arise.

1)

The specification states (8.1.4) that v matches a stable identifier
pattern r if r == v. In actuality, the test is v == r.

```scala
class C(name : String) { 
    override def equals(o : Any) = { 
        Console.println(name + " == ...")
        super.equals(o)
    }
}

object O extends C("O")

val V = new C("V")

scala> val ov = O match { case V => true; case _ => false }
O == ...
ov: Boolean = false
```

Either the specification or implementation is in error.


2)

When matching against an object, even though it is a stable identifier
pattern, no == -based comparison is made.

```scala
scala> val ov = V match { case O => true; case _ => false }
ov: Boolean = false
```

Presumably direct reference equality is used, and this is indeed
necessary for an object pattern's type refinement properties to be safe.

Thus, an object pattern as currently implemented is *not* a stable
identifier pattern, despite the spec.


3)

An object pattern provides stronger type refinement than a singleton type pattern.

```scala
object O

scala> def f[X] : X => X = { case O => O }
f: [X](X) => X

scala> def g[X] : X => X = { case _:O.type => O }
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : O.type (with underlying type object O)
 required: X
       def g[X] : X => X = { case _:O.type => O }
```

Presumably matching to O gives us constraints X <: O.type <: X on the
right-hand side of the case clause, since the only possible subtypes of
a singleton type are Null and Nothing, and from the match we know that X
must be inhabited by a non-null value.

However, for an explicit type pattern, we only get the constraint X <:
O.type, since we're using the generic rule for types which cannot assume
that there couldn't be strict non-null subtypes.

Singleton type patterns should be given special treatment to make them
equivalent with the object patterns, and/or there should be a way to
match non-object stable identifier patterns with as strong type
refinements as object patterns get.


Summary:

Object patterns currently behave differently both from other stable
identifier patterns and from singleton type patterns. It is impossible
to get similar matching for other stable names. The specification is
greatly out of sync with the implementation.

Here's a sketch of the situation and my view of how it should be:

```scala
pattern               matched with            type refinement
                   spec  impl     ideal     spec    impl    ideal
object             ==    eq       eq        none?   strong  strong
other stable id    ==    ==(rev)  eq        none?   none    strong
singleton type     eq    eq       eq        weak    weak    weak or strong
```

The *point* of stable identifiers is that they have these wonderful
singleton types. It seems silly to have a pattern that is constrained to
stable identifiers, yet compares them with a user-definable equals() and
provides no type refinements. An equals()-tested value could just as
well be provided by an arbitrary expression, so you could just as well
add a pattern { expr } which would be evaluated during the match, and
the result compared with == against the matched value.

Yet, on the other hand, it would *also* be at times useful to have

```scala
def f[X] : Class[X] => X = { case { classOf[int] } => 42 }
```

provide the proper type refinements, which of course requires that the
match is done with eq. It's silly that currently one has to write:

```scala
def f[X] : Class[X] => X = { 
    val IC = classOf[int]
    { case _ : IC.type => 42 } 
}
```

As a general rule in programming language design, I think that if a
variable is used only once, it should be inlinable away. Currently this
is not possible in Scala.

So, both eq-compared type-refinable matches and ==-compared
non-refinable matches have their place, and I think both need better
support from the language than they currently have.

One more quirk that I discovered: a type refinement in a pattern match clause doesn't seem to work properly when the refined type is used in a, uh, "type refinement" in the different sense of explicitly providing type constraints. With 2.7.1.r15804-b20080816212059, the following fails:

```scala
object T3 {
  class A { type T }
  case class B[X]
  object C extends B[Int]
  def f[X](b : B[X]) : A { type T = X } = b match { 
    case C => new A { type T = Int }
  }
}

T3.scala:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : T3.A{ ... }
 required: T3.A{type T = X}
    case C => new A { type T = Int }
```

However, this can be worked around by using a simple wrapper class around the refined type. With the following change it works:

```scala
  def f[X](b : B[X]) : A { type T = X } = {
    case class W[Y](a : A { type T = Y })
    val w : W[X] = b match { 
      case C => W[Int](new A { type T = Int })
    }
    w.a
  }
```

The patch I added for #3887 causes 1) and 2) in the first comment to behave as specified ( == called on the pattern).  The dependent case analysis presented in this bug appears to no longer work.  That is, the first example gives the same compile error as the second.

Can you clarify what is no longer working? I can't tell what you are referring to.  I find about the same behavior for everything I tried.
```scala

scala> trait T[X]
defined trait T

scala> object O extends T[Int]
defined module O

scala> def f[X] : T[X] => X = { case O => 42 }
f: [X](T[X]) => X

scala> val V = new T[Int] { }
V: java.lang.Object with T[Int] = $$anon$$1@50ec2522

scala> def g[X] : T[X] => X = { case V => 42 }
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(42)
 required: X
       def g[X] : T[X] => X = { case V => 42 }
                                          ^

scala> def g[X] : T[X] => X = { case _ : V.type => 42 }
g: [X](T[X]) => X

scala> g(V)
res0: Int = 42
```
