According to the eclipse scala plugin web page, one needs to alter the buildSpec of the .project file when upgrading. In fact, this is required for a new project in a newly installed 2.7.3 -- I was not upgrading from 2.7.2.

After the manual change of the buildSpec, eclipse can compile scala.

The necessary edit to .project:

<buildSpec>
        <buildCommand>
            <name>ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core.scalabuilder</name>
            <arguments>
            </arguments>
        </buildCommand>
        </buildSpec>
I thought it was by the Scala Project Wizard, but I tried again and cannot reproduce it. Sorry and thanks for the quick response.

I'll repoen this if I can reproduce it.
