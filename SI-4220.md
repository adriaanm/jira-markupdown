The code
```scala
class Boo(a: Int = 0)

object test {
	class Boo
}
```
causes an assertion to get thrown by sbt when it analyzes the compiler output. It wants to call companionClass on the outer Boo class.

I don't understand much of this, but  it looks like the flatOwnerInfo.decl call ends up putting both Boos in the resulting set, which makes it look overloaded which causes the assertion in suchThat to fire.

Running against 2.8.1 (though the sbt ticket says it was tried against a 2.9 snapshot.) I looked at the current code.
(In r24211) The comment for isCoDefinedWith has long said

  Is this symbol defined in the same scope
  and compilation unit as `that' symbol?

But "same scope" was never checked, only "same compilation unit."
Presumably other layers of logic kept this from being noticed until
now, but it has been crashing sbt.  Added check to isCoDefinedWith.
Closes #4220, review by odersky.
