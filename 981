There is indeed a problem with scalac's Java signatures: `PartialFunction.orElse`:
```scala
def orElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](that: PartialFunction[A1, B1]) : PartialFunction[A1, B1] = 
```
has the following illegal signature:
```scala
<A1:B1:Ljava/lang/Object;>(....)
```

It misses the upper bound for A1, it should be something like `<A1:TA;B1:....`
