Whoops - I'm very very sorry, should have seen that!

Still, the ideas in scala/bug#1220 look very similar to my approach with the
```scala
  @volatile var tailDefined = false
  override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = { tailDefined = true; tl }
```

So why shouldn't that work? Do I miss something here?
