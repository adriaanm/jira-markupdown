I've just noticed scala/bug#2441 is a duplicate of this, so I'm closing that and keeping this one - but that one is worth checking out as well.  The situation there looks to be specific to companions, and is along the lines of:
```scala
class T
trait A { def f: T }
object Bob {
  private class X extends T
}
class Bob extends A {
  def f = new Bob.X
}  
```
That should either fail to compile, or the type inferred for f in Bob should be T.  Instead it is Bob.X.
