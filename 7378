Hey, you totally must have picked up "cavalcade" from my comment in JavaConversions.  (Not that you learned the word, but that it was on your mind.)
{code}
  // Note to implementors: the cavalcade of deprecated methods herein should
  // serve as a warning to any who follow: don't overload implicit methods.
{code}
