Annotating a primary constructor is pretty ugly.  For example:
```scala
@Component
class Foo @Autowired()(val bar: Bar) {
  //...
}
```

It would be nice if you could target what would normally be a class annotation at the primary constructor - for example:
```scala
object Annotations {
  type AutowiredConstructor = Autowired @primaryConstructor
}

@Component
@AutowiredConstructor
class Foo(val bar: Bar) {
  //...
}
```
