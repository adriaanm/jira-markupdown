Short description: Copying mutable.HashSet (adding all elements of a mutable.HashSet to an empty mutable.HashSet) is very slow.
Cause: Excessive collisions results from the characteristic of the FlatHashTable#index method and lack of the sizeHint method.
Possible fix: Modify FlatHashTable#index method and/or implement sizeHint method.


Detailed Description:

Running attached benchmark script, copying mutable.HashSet is 100x slower than java.util.HashSet.
This only occurs when adding all elements of a mutable.HashSet to an empty HashSet.
If we sort the values before adding to a HashSet, it runs fast.

After careful inspection, I found that:

- HashSet is implemented using FlatHashTable, an open addressing hash table with linear probing.
- HashSet nor FlatHashTable implements sizeHint, so that the hash table grows as elements are added.
- FlatHashTable#index, the method computing the slot index, uses the upper bits of improved hash code.
- The smaller hash table, the fewer bits are used.
- The foreach method enumerates the elements in FlatHashTable#index order.
- Consequently, the higher bits of improved hash codes of successive elements are almost same.
- This results in higher collision rate until the table grow up enough.

The FlatHashTable#index method is modified at 2.9.x.
At 2.8.x, it uses the lower bits of improved hash code, so that the problem does not occurred.

A possible fix is to use the lower bits of improved hash code, but I am not sure about other impacts on characteristics of the method.
Another possible fix is to implement sizeHint method and call it from ++= and other methods.
Contrary to what the subject implies, `HashMap` uses `HashTable`, not `FlatHashTable`.
The decision to use the upper bits on `HashTable` came from this commit:

    Changed hash code strategy in hash table - now taking most significant bits when transforming the hash code into an index.
```

And `HashTable` also has an explanation of why:

```scala
  // Note:                                                                                                      
  // we take the most significant bits of the hashcode, not the lower ones                                      
  // this is of crucial importance when populating the table in parallel   
```

I'm surprised `mutable.HashTable` is used at all on the parallel collections.
bq. Contrary to what the subject implies, `HashMap` uses `HashTable`, not `FlatHashTable`.

I have misunderstood that, so that I corrected the summary.
Thank you for responding my sudden request.

XORing with random values seems good.
Instead of using a random value, we could choose the value that makes the improved hash code of the element added first time to be 0xc0000000 (or some higher value):

```scala
protected var mask: Int = _

def addEntry(elem: A) : Boolean = {
  if (tableSize == 0) {
    mask = ...
    // improve(mask ^ elem.hashCode) == 0xc0000000
  }

  ...
}
```

This guarantee the element to be placed at the third quater of the table, ensureing the value changes every time.
