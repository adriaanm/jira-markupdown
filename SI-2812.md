From the The Scala Language Specification:
   A member labeled abstract override must override at least one other member and all members overridden by it must be incomplete

Given the definition of "incomplete", this should fail consequently:
```scala
trait Concrete {
  def x(i: Int): String = i.toString
}

trait Overrider extends Concrete {
  abstract override def x(i: Int): String = "42"
}
trait SelfOverrider { self: Concrete => 
  abstract override def x(i: Int): String = "42"
}
```

Both `Overrider` and `SelfOverrider` should fail because the `abstract override` members do, in fact, override a concrete member.

Another point: When I read the spec today when looking for issue #2808, I was completely puzzled by the explanation because it seemed to directly contradict the compiler's behaviour in the particular case on the mailing list. I read the paragraph five times and then thought something is wrong...
IMO there are several things problematic here:
 * The definition in the spec is, in fact, the obvious one. `abstract override` prevents you from accidentally overriding a concrete member. Or so I thought. As the example from above shows, it does not.
 * I understand the currently implemented meaning of `abstract override` as: flag this member such that when occuring in a template, a concrete member must be defined before this trait is mixed into the hierarchy. This example should stress this difference between `override` and  `abstract override`:
```scala
abstract class AbstractClass {
  def x(i: Int): String
}
trait XImpl extends AbstractClass {
  override def x(i: Int): String = "42"
}
(new AbstractClass with XImpl).x(5) // => 42
```
  Changing `override` into `abstract override` fails with
```scala
<console>:7: error: object creation impossible, since 
                    method x in trait XImpl of type (i: Int)String is 
                    marked `abstract' and `override'
       (new AbstractClass with XImpl).x(5)
```
  This makes sense, because the purpose of `abstract override` (as I learned from the staircase book) is to allow the use of `super` even if the overridden method is still abstract in its current form. The error message should be improved by adding to "since [...] is marked `abstract` and `override` *but no concrete implementation could be found in the supertypes*" or similar.
 * Given the current purpose of `abstract override` what is the purpose of the restriction this ticket is about (especially if not enforced)?

So, for me it looks like there are the two orthogonal meanings of `abstract override`, the obvious, though broken, one, which, even if it would work, probably had only little effect, and the currently implemented one for which the name `abstract override` seems a little odd to me. Perhaps `late override` would be better... (I know: "not another keyword" so `lazy override`, perhaps ?!?)
I changed the spec to drop the mentioned clause. I also changed the error message in the compiler.
(In r20294) Closes #2812 (and removed a left-over println in Types). no review necessary.
