Reading the API from Iterable I understand that size should return the number of elements to be returned by the iterator.

MetaData breaches this contract:

```scala
scala> <a x="x"/>.attributes.size
res2: Int = 2

scala> <a x="x"/>.attributes.iterator.size
res3: Int = 1
```
(extempore in [r25917](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25917)) Fixes NPE using iterator with an XML attribute being null or None (#5052)
Also fixes incorrect size method (#5115)
