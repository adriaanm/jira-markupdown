Thanks, you got it exactly right. This was a learning experience for me, and thanks to your info, not entirely fruitless.

Unfortunately, there is no JIRA label for not-entirely-fruitless. It was fun adding "java-interop", which is only a slight stretch.

The problem was that the constants were ingested incorrectly from the other class file. Now the copies are not differing, modulo separate recompilation.
