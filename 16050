=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
The following code is part of a larger project. Alone it will compile without errors, but when compiled together with the project code it results in a compiler error given below.

The class Pixel in question has a protected constructor. If the protected modifier is removed the compiler seems to go into an infinite loop. I included a stacktrack and a snapshot from VisualVM while the compiler was running in case there are some clues there.

The problems was discovered while upgrading from 2.8.0 to 2.9.0.rc1. All library dependencies was recompiled to 2.9.0.rc1.

  - Operating system: Windows 7 (32-bit)
