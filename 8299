The problem is that javac writes errors to stderr which is not checked in RunnerManager#runCommandImpl().

I have a fix which redirects stderr to stdout, but the implementation is a hack as I don't see how to do the redirection when using scala.sys.process._. I'm gonna spend some more time on it. (Another solution could be the -Xstdout option of javac, but it's non-standard, so I'd rather avoid it.)

Or maybe stdout and stderr should be handled separately? E.g. stdout is checked against **.check and stderr is checked against **.check-err
