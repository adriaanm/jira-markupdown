Current config:
Eclipse Galileo 3.5.2, JDT 3.5.2.r352_v20100108...
Mylyn 3.3.2
Scala Eclipse Plugin 2.8.0.r21146-b20100312035748 

Although it was happening for some time on older versions.

The problem:

With no Scala projects in workspace I am working on regular java projects and projects with Spring IDE nature all while using Mylyn to track the context. From time to time UI thread gets stuck for about 30-60 seconds making it impossible to work with the IDE. The problem is not easily reproducible although it seems to happen more frequently when there are many compile errors in the openend editor (for instance while practicing test-first).
Investigation into the cause of the problem revealed that it is reading JAR files madly. It seems that it reads one class at a time from all jars on the classpath of project at hand. Eventually I was able to catch a stack trace of the thread and it seems that a certain interaction of Mylyn and Scala modified JDT is causing this. I am attaching screenshots from Eclipse debug session. If any more info would be helpful that I can gather please let me know.
