A simple test case,
```scala
// Foo.java
public class Foo<A> {
  public class Bar<B> {
    public void bar() {}
  }

  public Bar<A> create() {
    return new Bar<A>();
  }
}
```
```scala
// Test.scala
object Test {
  def m(x: Foo[Int]) = x.create.bar
}
```

The problem is ClassfileParser's handling of signature attributes mentioning the parameterized inner class. It's looking for a name terminated by a ';' or a '.' which is fine in the unparameterized case, but when the inner class is parameterized the name can be terminated by a '<' at the start of it's type arguments.

Attached patch fixes that, but I'd like this reviewed carefully before I commit because this is clearly a very sensitive area.
