Frequently, when using the SDT, source code for some parts of the Scala library is not loadable in Eclipse SDT, while other classes are loadable. However, this behavior is not entirely consistent, in that sometimes the IDE will locate all library classes correctly. It does seem however, that once source-code for classes cannot be found, the problem persists at least until restart.

In the not found case, the classes can be located within the Scala library Jar, eg in Project Explorer, but clicking on some classes results in a "Source Cannot be found" error, and the decompiled class files are shown instead.

As mentioned, this problem does not always show up, but Ive observed it happen at least 50 times in all, and its present perhaps 80% of the time while Im using the IDE.

Steps likely to show problem:

I often see the issue show up with type Traversable. Source for Traversable itself can be located, but the source for TraversableLike cannot. Similarly for Iterable and IterableLike.
