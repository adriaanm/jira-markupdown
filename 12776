Hmm, I would like [http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/66 my ticket 66] to be removed. I've gathered it doesn't make sense. (If I returh a JCL-based type, I already have access to "underlying"; what I wanted is Collections-aware Seq's and Iterable's, but it's hardly possible). [[BR]]
Please, remove ticket scala/bug#66.
