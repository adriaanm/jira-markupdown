For the default implementations of map or filter present in Iterable, they will definitely not terminate on infinite collections. All infinite collections should be projections and they should override map and filter (although sometimes we can't override filter). I guess we could put a giant disclaimer at the top of Iterable saying that if the collection is or could be infinite, it should inherit from Projection and overridden certain methods (map, filter, and so on...).
