I have noticed another encoding-related info. Terminal output has fragment shown below. Here YYY.scala is definitely UTF-8 file with some "Cp1251-forbidden" Array[Char] literals. As a result, projects can not be build at all.


{code}
...
build XXX.scala
IO error while decoding /.../YYY.scala with windows-1251
Please try specifying another one using the -encoding option
build ZZZ.scala
...
{code}
