Compling code that uses macro with the rangepos option produces errors like this:

    scala.tools.nsc.interactive.RangePositions$ValidateException: Synthetic tree [251] contains nonsynthetic tree [250]

A demo project can be found here:

Ran into this in the context of mixing scoverage with a library I'm maintaining (see https://github.com/wix/accord/issues/60). It is indeed a non-issue for 2.11, but it basically breaks 2.10 if you use `-Yrangepos` for any reason, such as getting code coverage.
