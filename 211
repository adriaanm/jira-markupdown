Here is another example, with some comments. I hope this makes my concerns clear and concrete:
{code}
object Test {
  def repeat(x: => Unit)(times: Int) = for (_ <- 1 to times) x

  def test() {
    // prints foo 5 times
    repeat(println("foo"))(5)
    
    // prints foo once
    val r = repeat(println("foo")) _
    // does not print anything
    r(5)
  }
}
{code}
If you don't find this behavior at all surprising, maybe you could provide some intuition for why it is correct?
