I know this is a consequence of there now being different classpaths calculated depending on whether -optimise is set, only because I fixed SI-2928.  It was and is hard coded to look at settings.XO.value so -Yinline is left in the lurch.  Thus do I know how to fix it, but I'm leaving it because I would really like first for someone to document why we find ourselves with a classpath with such a powerful interest in the compiler switches.

(In r20794) Raised the level of abstraction (slightly, not enough) on
ClassPath by defining the difference between optimized and
regular classpaths in terms of an arbitrary name filter instead
of in terms of settings.XO.  Altered the decision logic to
look at the value of -Yinline instead of -optimise.
Closes SI-2950.  Review by rytz.
