As far as I can tell, the `Console.withIn` thing doesn't solve the java.io.Console problem at all - you can still only type a single character:
{code}
scala> Console.withIn(System.in) {System.console.readLine("username: ")}
username: res10: java.lang.String = a

scala> bcde
{code}
This matters less for `System.console.readLine` since you can always use `Console.readLine` instead, but what are you supposed to use instead of `System.console.readPassword`?
