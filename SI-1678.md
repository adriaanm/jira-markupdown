 If the line defining broken is commented out then this code compiles just fine

  class Foo[A]
  
  def doSomething[A](arg : Foo[A]) : Foo[A] = arg
  
  val ok = doSomething(new Foo[Int])

  val broken = doSomething(new Foo[Nothing])

But with it uncommented I get
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Foo[Nothing]
 required: Foo[A]
         val broken = doSomething(new Foo[Nothing])


Note that the line definining ok compiles fine even though the only difference is the use of Int as Foo's type parameter.
This seems to be quite similar to SI-1570, especially because the problem here also goes away when Foo is made covariant, so I am going to say that they have the same root cause and that this is a duplicate.
