For some classes type comparison (<:<) throws `CyclicReference` exception. I's hard for me to tell exactly why this happens, but I found one example where I able to reproduce it:

{code}
typeOf[java.util.Date] <:< typeOf[net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager]
{code}

I have a feeling that there is something is very special about `net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager` which causes this issue.

for convenience I created this small project that demonstrates the issue:

https://github.com/OlegIlyenko/scala-reflection-cyclic-reference-error

You can find an exception with full stack-trace in the build of the project:

The actual code to reproduce the issue is here:
