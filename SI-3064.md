Compiling scalac with -unchecked we see these warnings.  Do they even make sense? Experimentally I see that a type test on an abstract type does the right thing in the concrete class.  So if Type <: AbsType and _: Type is equivalent to _: AbsType, then there's no reason for scalac to hassle me to change it to AbsType.

The third warning, about TypeTree(), is a little different. The unapply method in the abstract class takes a TypeTree as an argument, so the pattern matcher generated type test is in scalac's opinion unchecked.

Summary: if there is some validity to these warnings we should identify it and fix the code, and if there isn't we should seek a way not to emit them.
