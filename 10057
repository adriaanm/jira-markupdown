This error is due to the existence of a `AssignOrNamedArg` node (https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Trees.scala#L444) in the `args` Tree here - https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Typers.scala#L4602.

Filtering out the AssignOrNamedArg to the `rhs` value (i.e., the value assigned) makes the implicit resolution work.

Got a fix at https://github.com/m4dc4p/scala/tree/m4dc4p/SI-7809 and will submit soon.
