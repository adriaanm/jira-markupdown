Here's another idea.
```scala
-addBound(tp.typeConstructor)
-isSubArgs(lhs, rhs, params, AnyDepth)
+isSubArgs(lhs, rhs, params, AnyDepth) && {addBound(tp.typeConstructor); true}
```

With this patch, both this test and t6846.scala compile. A quick run of `pt --pos --neg` is also green.

What I'm trying to avoid, is registering both type constructors `K` and `Split` as bounds, which leads to them later being glb-ed in a seemingly nonsensical way. (What does `RefinementType(parents = K, Split)` mean, anyway?)
