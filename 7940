In SI-5005 I noticed something similar, a specialized method not being generated for an anon-closure-class.

However, in that case and also here, a "correct" implementation for that method must be inherited, right? (Otherwise the bytecode verifier would complain).

Including the javap of {{Inter}} would help in visualizing the specialization vs bytecode-duplication tradeoff.
