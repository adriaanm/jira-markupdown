{code}
def foo = {
  var a = ArrayBuffer[Int]()
  println (a.isInstanceOf[Seq[Int]])
}
{code}
gives the following warning under -checked:
{code}
warning: non variable type-argument Int in type scala.collection.mutable.Seq[Int] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
  println (a.isInstanceOf[Seq[Int]])
{code}

Surely there should be no complaint about erasure in a purely local analysis. I'm telling it that it is a buffer of Int, and expect it to infer that it is a seq of Int. 
Use a type ascription, not a cast, to achieve what you describe.

{code}
println(a: Seq[Int])
{code}

In the future, could you please first check on the [scala-language] mailing list before lodging tickets for things that are not clear bugs.
You could start by giving me a little credit. I know _exactly_ how to get around the warning. The issue is not about the cast.

The bigger issue, which affects my code everywhere is this: The variable `a` is local, and any self-respecting intra-procedural analysis should reflect that `a` is a `Seq[Int]`. It should not need any further ascription, and requiring it should be considered a bug.  This should NOT be an issue of erasure. 
You don't have to give me any credit, if I don't get it.

The example is isInstanceOf, not asInstanceOf.

For the case of asInstanceOf, there is no extra checkcast.  Let's give intraprocedural analysis some respect.

For the lack of a warning, SI-1558.  So on that basis, I'll never asInstanceOf, because I'll never presume to tell the type system I know what I'm doing. Except maybe null.asInstanceOf.

For the case of isInstanceOf, maybe the question is, should instanceof be optimized away.

If you issue the instanceof, should you still warn?  And if you must warn, is there a way to selectively turn off warnings?  (Hopefully eventually?)

Reopening due to the mentioned thread and copying the example here:

I see the following spurious warning frequently, which drowns out useful unchecked warnings:

{code:lang=java}
sealed trait A[T]
final class B[T] extends A[T]

object ParsedAxis {
   def x(a: A[Int]) =
      a match {
         case b: B[Int] => 3
      }
}
{code}

{code}
A.scala:7: non-variable type argument Int in type pattern B[Int] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
         case b: B[Int] => 3
                 ^
{code}

In this case, the warning can be resolved by using a type variable:

{code}
         case b: B[i] => 3
{code}

but this is less useful when reading the code and isn't possible when `B[Int]` is inside a type alias like `type BI = B[Int]`.  Similarly, `Int @unchecked` can be used, but it is less safe than the type variable approach, where the compiler still knows that `i=Int` is the only possibility.  In fact, if another type argument is used, the compiler complains:

{code}
pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
  found   : B[String]
  required: A[Int]
         case b: B[String] => 3
                 ^
{code}
Copied from Paul's comment on SI-6338:

I'm not really working on 2.10 anymore, but if anyone wants it, this warning and other issues are handled here: https://github.com/paulp/scala/tree/topic/210-quieter-warnings
