For certain inputs, the result of Iterator.span, followed by toSeq and toList, is wrong. If span is directly followed by toList, everything is fine.

{code}
def spanA(list: List[Int], x: Int) =
  list.iterator.span(_ == x) match {
    case (a,b) => (a.toList, b.toList)
  }

def spanB(list: List[Int], x: Int) =
  list.iterator.span(_ == x) match {
    case (a,b) => (a.toSeq, b.toSeq) match {
      case (a,b) => (a.toList, b.toList)
    }
  }

println("A1: " + spanA(List(1, 2, 3), 1) )
println("B1: " + spanB(List(1, 2, 3), 1) )

println()

println("A2: " + spanA(List(1, 2, 1), 1) )
println("B2: " + spanB(List(1, 2, 1), 1) )
{code}

results in


{code}
A1: (List(1),List(2, 3))
B1: (List(1),List(2, 3))

A2: (List(1),List(2, 1))
B2: (List(1, 1),List(2))
{code}

Interestingly, the misbehaviour only seems to occur here when the last element of the input list equals the first, even though the span operation should never even look at the last element in these example cases.

I think the problem is in {{Iterator.span}} in {{Leading.advance()}}. If the trailing iterator starts iterating before the leading iterator starts, and the leading iterator starts iterating before the trailing iterator finishes, the leading iterator may end up stealing some elements that belong to the trailing iterator in {{advance()}}.

The problem appears to be resolved by checking {{isDone}} in {{advance()}} in {{src/library/scala/collection/Iterator.scala}}, which currently is set but never checked:

{noformat}
@@ -564,7 +564,7 @@ trait Iterator[+A] extends TraversableOnce[A] {
     class Leading extends AbstractIterator[A] {
       val lookahead = new mutable.Queue[A]
       def advance() = {
-        self.hasNext && p(self.head) && {
+        !isDone && self.hasNext && p(self.head) && {
           lookahead += self.next
           true
         }
{noformat}

When I make this change, I get the following output for your test:

{noformat}
A1: (List(1),List(2, 3))
B1: (List(1),List(2, 3))

A2: (List(1),List(2, 1))
B2: (List(1),List(2, 1))
{noformat}

I also made another simple example to illustrate:

{code}
val original = List(1, 2, 3).iterator
val (front, back) = original.span(_ != 2)
back.drop(1)
println(front.toList)
{code}

Before making the change to {{Iterator.scala}}, this incorrectly results in {{List(1, 3)}}. After making the change, it correctly results in {{List(1)}}.
