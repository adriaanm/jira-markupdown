For Scala's immutable maps

{code:java}
m + (p, q) // two map entries as vararg
{code}

appears to be three orders of magnitude slower than the functionally equivalent

{code:java}
m + p + q // separate map entries
{code}

and

{code:java}
Seq(p, q).foldLeft(m)(_ + _)
{code}

Ready to run as micro-benchmark.
I'm not sure there's anything we could do in a binary compatible way, so I'm scheduling it for 2.13.

The current translation scheme for empty varargs doesn't exactly look great:

{code:scala}
  val m1 = Map.empty[Int, Unit]
  m1 + (1 -> ()) + (2 -> ())
  // MapBenchmark.this.m1().+[Unit](scala.this.Predef.ArrowAssoc[Int](1).->[Unit](())).+[Unit](scala.this.Predef.ArrowAssoc[Int](2).->[Unit](()));

  val m2 = Map.empty[Int, Unit]
  m2 + (1 -> (), 2 -> ())
  // MapBenchmark.this.m2().+[Unit](scala.this.Predef.ArrowAssoc[Int](1).->[Unit](()), scala.this.Predef.ArrowAssoc[Int](2).->[Unit](()), scala.this.Predef.wrapRefArray[(Int, Unit)](Array[(Int, Unit)]{}))
{code}

There's a new empty array that gets wrapped instead of using something like `Nil`, but in the end it doesn't matter. Passing a pre-computed empty collection as the varargs argument is just as slow.
Thanks for looking into this.

FWIW, {{Seq(p, q).foldLeft(m)(_ + _)}} seems to be as fast as {{m + p + q}}. I updated my example and this issue description accordingly.

The one thing you might consider for 2.11.9 and 2.12.x is putting a warning in the API documentation for this operator.
