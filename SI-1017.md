The following code block fails to compile with the following error message: forward reference extends over definition of variable x

 {code}
      def foo = {
       bar
      }
    
      var x = 1  // comment this line to compile without errors
    
      def bar = 1
 }}

However it compiles when either commenting the the var x = 1 line or by moving the bar def to the top.
I believe this could be fixed by changing the way the script runner wraps a
script.  Currently, scripts are compiled with their contents dropped directly
into a main method, like this:
{code}
object Main {
  def main(argv: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val args = argv;
    // script goes here
  }
}
{code}
It would be nicer if the contents were inserted into an object, like this:
{code}
object Main {
  def main(argv: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val args = argv;
    new AnyRef {
      // script goes here
    }
  }
}
{code}
Such an encoding should solve this feature request, and it would also
support a number of other constructs that work in an object but not
in a method.

The relevant code is in ScriptRunner.scala, if anyone wants to try.
I think Lex' suggestion is excellent. Can we do that, please?

The error will still not go away if you place the code in a block, but that's intentional. It's necessary to ensure that foo cannot potentially see uninitialized block-local variables.
