I think the spec is reasonably clear that :// is not a valid token.
```scala
Tokens may be separated by whitespace characters and/or comments. Comments come in two forms:
A single-line comment is a sequence of characters which starts with // and extends to the end of the line.
```
The only way :// could be valid is if you couldn't separate tokens there (e.g. in the middle of a string literal.) Since : is a valid token, :// is a : and a comment.

But it is true the spec should be clarified.  The above lines are from section 1.4, and section 1.1 says "an identifier can start with an operator character followed by an arbitrary sequence of operator characters" without putting any qualifiers on "arbitrary".  Some kind of "except for" clause would be enough.
