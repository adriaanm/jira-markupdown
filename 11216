[~extempore] It's a documentation error in that what is abstract and what is not doesn't match up with how things are actually delivered.  They _do_ override various methods to use head etc., but the documentation needs to spell out that it is your job to implement those efficiently AND then use those to implement the abstract methods.

If you mean "why is there even an LinearSeq and LinearSeqOptimized", well, yeah.  Needs to be some redesign.  "LinearSeq" doesn't sound to me like "please use head and tail for Iterator but not anything else".

However, given that this is what LinearSeq has come to mean, for good or (more likely) for ill, at least the docs should clearly spell that out.
