Under some conditions, for instance if a type parameter is present, the default argument value of a method parameter is not printed. Try for example:

{code}
trait Test {
  def f   (a: Seq[List[Any]] = Seq.empty[List[Any]])
  def g[A](a: Seq[List[A]]   = Seq.empty[List[A]])
}
{code}

Imo it would be satisfactory to print the textual representation of the default argument (see also SI-3721).
Seemingly, text effects do not work as described, so the code again:

trait Test {
  def f   (a: Seq[List[Any]] = Seq.empty[List[Any]])
  def g[A](a: Seq[List[A]]   = Seq.empty[List[A]])
}

Sorry.  The bug database sucks beyond all comprehension.  Since anyone can set any priority to a ticket, the existing ~1000 tickets have a mix of priorities I have set and arbitrary priorities chosen by anyone.  I need some way to communicate priorities so I went around the database lowering the priority of all the ones which are higher than the default where I did not personally raise it.

About this bug, from one standpoint it's easy to agree, and from another, no scaladoc bug is going to compete for the very small space I have in which to place higher priority bugs.
