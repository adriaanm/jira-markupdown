```java
scala> val a = Iterator.from(1)
a: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> val b = a.toTraversable
b: Traversable[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> b foreach {x=>()}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded
```

Well, this is expected thinking that there is a Stream and `b` holds its head.
But that is the reason to create Stream (and introduce its problems) when only Traversable is needed ?

```java
class Iterator[T] { outer =>
  // Why there is this code
  def toTraversable = toStream
  // And not something like this?
  def toTraversable = new Traversable[T] { 
    def foreach[U](callback: T=>U) { outer foreach callback }
  }
}
```
That might be enough for `TraversableOnce`, but not for `Traversable`. One should be able to write:

```scala
scala> val it = List(1, 2).iterator
it: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> val ts = it.toTraversable
ts: Traversable[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> ts.foreach(println)
1
2

scala> ts.foreach(println)
1
2
```

For future reference: it's best to start these discussions on [scala-language] before lodging a bug.
