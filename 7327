Hi Adriaan,

Here is the code example that does not compile.
```scala
class D[-A] (v: A) {
  def get[T <: A] = v match {
    case x: T => x
  }
}

implicit def neg[A](x: A) = new D[D[A]]( new D[A](x) )

def size(t: D[D[Int] with D[String]]) = t

size("")
```
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : java.lang.String("")
 required: D[D[Int] with D[String]]
       size("")
            ^
```

Note that if we change the last line `size("")` to either of the following, then it does compile.
```scala
size(5)
res0: D[D[Int] with D[String]] = D@77d66

size("hi" : D[D[String]])
res1: D[D[Int] with D[String]] = D@a6bf88
```

So the problem is the implicit is not being found for the 2nd or greater leaf node in the input type, e.g.
```scala
D[D[Int] with D[String]]
```

Please let me know if this is insufficient to reopen this bug, and in such case, what further information you need from me.
