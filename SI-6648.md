The attached file compiles under Scala 2.9.2, crashes under 2.10.0-RC2 and the latest snapshot (2.10.0-20121104-170503-8b598436f6).  Test case is a simplifed version of [Scalate's LoopTest](https://github.com/scalate/scalate/blob/6720828f6a156a42e4d50f8907d81196a25c50b7/scalate-core/src/test/scala/org/fusesource/scalate/scuery/LoopTest.scala).
Good point on `$`, but still crashes the same way if `$` is changed to `select`.
Changed `$` to `select`.

    Fixes #SI-5578.
    ResetAttrs shouldn't be side-effecting on the original tree,
    since it can lead to NPEs in erroneous trees (or maybe even for valid ones?).

Seems to go wrong in flatten.
```scala
<     def <init>($outer: anonymous class LoopTest$transformer1$$anonfun$1$$anonfun$apply$1): anonymous class $anonfun$$anon = {
---
>     def <init>($outer: anonymous class LoopTest$transformer1$$anonfun$1$$anonfun$apply$1): anonymous class LoopTest$transformer1$$anonfun$1$$anonfun$apply$1$$anon$1 = {
```
Here's a better look at it:

```scala
abstract class Node extends NodeSeq
trait NodeSeq extends Seq[Node]
object NodeSeq {
  implicit def seqToNodeSeq(ns: Seq[Node]): NodeSeq = ???
}

class Transformer {
  def apply(nodes: Any): Any = ???
}

class LoopTest {
  def foo[B, That](f: Seq[B])(implicit bf: scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[Seq[Int], B, That]): That = ???

  object transformer1 extends Transformer {
    // Adding explicit type arguments, or making the impilcit view
    // seqToNodeSeq explicit avoids the crash
    foo {
      // These both avoid the crash:
      // {val t = new Transformer {}; t.apply(null)
      // new Transformer().apply(null)
      new Transformer {}.apply(null)

      null: NodeSeq
    }: NodeSeq
  }
}
```
Paul: I've been poking around at this one, it seems similar to the problems we're trying sort out in macro-land.

This will fix it:

But I expect we can do a bit better, seems like it should be handled in the existing `wasEmpty` checks. Any insights to share? I'm all ears.

By resetting that return type, we only end up with one `$anon` symbol after typer.

Before:

```
*             object transformer1#12052
*                 constructor transformer1#15334
*                 value <local transformer1>#15335
*                     anonymous class $anon#15341 (final)
*                     anonymous class $anon#21138 (final)
*                         constructor $anon#21139
*                         value <local $anon>#21141
*             object transformer1#12051 (private)
```

After:

```
  object transformer1#6962
* object transformer1#6963
*     constructor transformer1#15504
*     value <local transformer1>#15505
*         anonymous class $anon#21364 (final)
*             constructor $anon#21365
*             value <local $anon>#21367
```
