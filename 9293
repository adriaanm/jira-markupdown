This is related to the problem (which I haven't solved) of system-dependent file paths in output.  Paul patched that by normalizing backslashes, but that affects other output like \u0022.

I have an experimental "modeline"-style feature for configs. It was motivated by scalacheck options, e.g.:
```scala
/*
 * scalac: -deprecation
 * scalacheck: -workers 1 -minSize 0 -maxSize 4000 -minSuccessfulTests 5
 */
```
For config specific to a test, it avoids extra files; my other idea was to process "enclosing" .flags files, e.g., presentation.flags.

Either in a .flags or header, `filter: Java HotSpot` or similar as a line-oriented filter.

Or {noformat}map: _ replaceAll ('\\','/'){noformat} or similar would be fun.

The other thing I noticed it that we compare stdout + stderr.  It would be nice to be able to diff only stdout.  I see my code uses a ProcessLogger (I forget that Process API as soon as I use it).
