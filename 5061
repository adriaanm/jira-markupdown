What is happening I believe is this: mixin assumes that if you have a pending super.foo call to SuperTrait, that SuperTrait will be one of your parents.  But if SuperTrait was specialized, the pending super.foo has been rewritten to super.foo$mcI$sp or whatever, but SuperTrait$mcI$sp has not been added to your parents.  When exactly these transformations take place, and when they are SUPPOSED to take place, is anyone's supposition.
