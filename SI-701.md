Until v2.6.1, the hierarchy of the Scala distribution on Unix looked as follows:
{code}
scala-2.6.1-final
|-- bin
|   |-- fsc -> ../share/scala/bin/fsc
|   |-- sbaz -> ../share/scala/bin/sbaz
|   |-- sbaz-setup -> ../share/scala/bin/sbaz-setup
|   |-- scala -> ../share/scala/bin/scala
|   |-- scalac -> ../share/scala/bin/scalac
|   |-- scaladoc -> ../share/scala/bin/scaladoc
|   `-- scalap -> ../share/scala/bin/scalap
`-- share
    |-- doc
    |-- man
    `-- scala
{code}
This organisation corresponds to the standard layout of Unix systems,  Mac OS included. Therefore, it was very easy to install Scala using a tool like GNU stow (see http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). For unknown reasons, this organisation changed with 2.7.0 and we now have:
{code}
scala-2.7.0-final
|-- bin
|-- doc
|-- lib
|-- man
|-- meta
|-- misc
`-- src
{code}
This is very annoying as it considerably complicates the installation of Scala on Unix-like systems. I would therefore be happy if the old scheme was restored, or I'd like to hear the motivation for this change. Thanks.
That decision was taken in one of our weekly Scala meetings and was submitted to the Scala community in the release candidates of version 2.7.0 without any negative feeback.

The suggested solution is to use a short shell script to build the missing hierarchy for you.

Hi Stï¿½phane,

Thank you for the script. May I suggest that you include it in the Scala distribution? I think it will be useful to most people.

I understand that the change was approved by the Scala team, however I still don't understand the rationale behind it. For users like me, it looks like a step backwards: installing Scala now has become harder on Unix systems than it was before, and actually harder than other open source programs (for which a {{configure --prefix <prefix> && make install}} does the trick). Of course, a script like the one you attached helps, but first of all it does not seem to be widely available, and second it wasn't necessary with the old organisation.

I feel there must be a good reason for the change but I can't see it, so I would be very happy if you could enlighten me. Thanks in advance!

(As an aside: the only reason I can imagine is that the organisation on Unix is now closer to the one on Windows. However, the match is not perfect since, according to <1>, there are still differences between the two distributions, like the {{man}} directory or the presence of {{.bat}} files. And talking about {{.bat}} files, I notice that they are now also included in the {{bin}} directory of the Unix distribution, which isn't documented in <1> and which, once again, does not look like an improvement to my eyes).
