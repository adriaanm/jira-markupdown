I think that the originally reported problem is sporadic (for me, at least), and what I am wondering is if the stack overflow error triggered some independent action by eclipse to disable content assist.  Something turned off content assist, and it was not me.  I will be editing more seriously later today, and perhaps that will retrigger the stack overflow (or not).

By-the-way, the stack overflow error, which was lurking in one of the log files:

{code}
java.lang.StackOverflowError
	at scala.tools.nsc.ast.TreeInfo.firstConstructor(TreeInfo.scala:143)
	at scala.tools.nsc.ast.TreeInfo.firstConstructor(TreeInfo.scala:147) (1000 times)
{code}
