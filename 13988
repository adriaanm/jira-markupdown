because the interpreter immediately uses the value in order to print it:

{code}
  ~> scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.3.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.5.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> lazy val x = 3
x: Int = 3
{code}

this might seem like a fairly trivial issue, but I think it has potential to confuse people who are trying stuff out in the REPL in order to understand the language.
