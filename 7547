I commented on scala/bug#5727.  For this example, when the qual$1 is generated (for qual$1.copy), the x$s in the getOrElse have already been generated with owner model, but ownership is not updated to qual$1.

That's why uncurry (in making the Function) fails to update owner. And that's why lambda lift thinks the x$s are free.

I'm about to see where to fix TNA (transformNamedAppl), and if that's it, I'll submit a pull, otherwise bounce the ball back.
