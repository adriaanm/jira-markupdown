I think you could quite easily fix the parser so that it would accept +,-,~,! as identifiers as a simple expression. However, that wouldn't be usable in many cases because this introduces a possible ambiguity between a name being meant as a prefix operator or as an identifier.

E.g. what should be the meaning of 

{code}
val + = 12
+ + + // should that mean (+).+(+) or the invalid (+ +).+
{code}
