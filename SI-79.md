In order to be more Java and JVM-compatible (see my previous ticket SI-66) I'm now returingn JCL collections classes from my Scala classes. But the "underlying" property is, in fact, invisible to Velocity.

Proposal: made the "underlying" property a @BeanProperty in JCL. [[BR]]
As @BeanProperty, it should be accessible to any JVM-based language.
Retracted by OP in SI-80.
