Well, it is a different error message in a slightly different situation (annotated trait rather than annotated method) and slightly different behavior (rather than a direct compile error, the trait compiles fine but then produces invalid class file; scala/bug#2764 occurs with single enum in the annotation but this bug only triggers with two).

It seems to me that it is likely but unknown whether fixing scala/bug#2764 will fix this. If we close this issue, there's no longer any trigger for someone to notice and confirm whether the issue has been resolved or not. So I'd prefer to leave open.
