I would not label this as my least favorite, but since it came up, but I will at least record it here.

Compiling this code:
{code}
object T {
  var X = 3
  val y =
    5 match {
      case X => true
      case _ => false
    }
}
{code}

gives the error message:

{code}
A.scala:5: not found: value X
      case X => true
           ^
{code}

An improvement might be "X is not a stable identifier" or similar.
