HI,
it seems to be a regression issue:

Since 2.11.2, if i want to enter a right square bracket "]" in the REPL i need to press the left square bracket key (AltGr-8) first and then the right square bracket key (AltGr-9) afterwards on my german keyboard.
I encountered this first in 2.11.2, the versions before were not affected.
A less intrusive workaround than manually replacing the jar is
{code}
scala -J-Xbootclasspath/p:$HOME/.ivy2/cache/jline/jline/jars/jline-2.11.jar
{code}
I just ran on the same issue. This bug was closed with the resolution "out of scope", but since the reason for this problem is a bug in a used library, why don't you just go back and use the jline version (obviously 2.11) that doesn't contain this bug in the first place until the bug has been fixed in some version 2.xx. Besides it is nice that the same bug has been posted on github/jiline2 to be fixed, but since there hasn't been any activity on this project for the last 7 months, it is very unlikely the bug will be fixed at all. 

So if there is no evident reason for scala REPL to use jline-2.12, please switch back to the working version or don't use jiline at all. Otherwise every user of scala REPL who uses keyboards with Alt-Gr key combinations will run into the same problem. Other than that simply pasting some code into REPL does not work for me when [ ] or @ is contained.

I sympathize, but the upgrade to jline 2.12 was motivated by the issues collected under https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8595, so, reverting to 2.11 would upset other users. I apologize for the inconvenience, but we're caught between two mythological unpleasant places, as they say. Ideally, jline would fix the upstream issue (https://github.com/jline/jline2/issues/156), and we'd upgrade again. If someone has a patch for jline, we'd also be willing to consider upgrading to that custom version, but, in reality, the core team can't afford to maintain forks of our dependencies ourselves.
@Adriaan: you're right, that certainly is a problem. Although it seems that issue SI-8644 was filed for the newer jiline, not for the older version - this is the bug concerning "paste" which I also have, when using jiline 2.12 (specifically paste does not work, when '[' is contained in the code). So basically it's only the arrow keys which did not work under some circumstances for 2.11 vs. copy/paste and generally inserting square brackets using 2.12. I don't know, I would feel the latter is worse, but it can be annoying as well when the arrow keys don't work. I agree with Bjorn's statements here that these bugs really make a bad impression on newbies using Scala.

I made some research and maybe found the problem - the original request was to use "Alt"-Key sequences in the editor:
https://github.com/jline/jline2/issues/144
to support any Alt-Key sequences mentioned here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C1_set
Unfortunately the implementation does not seem to distinguish between the "Alt" and the "Alt Gr" key. The Alt-Gr key however is used on some non-US keyboards for inserting square brackets, the @-symbol, curly braces, etc. 
https://github.com/jline/jline2/commit/22b3a2dce329e83a5ecfba137bde404c85954d47
So we get some fine Escape-sequences when inserting square brackets (or @) on some keyboards.

I misunderstood, the JLine maintainers are waiting for us to confirm their staged version works. [~bjornregnell] or [~michael72], could you give jline 2.12.1 a whirl and let them know whether it works so they can release, and we can bump the version in time for 2.11.6? Thanks!
