So for example in {{src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/rootdoc.txt}} where there's an attempted link
to {{scala.Predef}}, it doesn't even render as a link because there is no such class or trait, just the object. Another example is in the doc for {{Option}}, where the link to {{None}} doesn't render as a link.
