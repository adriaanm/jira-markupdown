in order to find that out (that it is a named parameter call), it needs to type check the expression {{ambiguousName = Some("bla")}}, to know whether that could be a valid assignment. For that, it needs to know the type of {{ambiguousName}}, which needs to be inferred. this type in turn depends on the type of {{c}}, which also needs to be inferred. this type then depends again on the type of {{ambiguousName}}, so we have a cyclic dependency.
