The ScalaDoc tool is breaking on a mixed Java/Scala project because it seems unable to properly parse Java code with an inherited inner enum.  I have recreated the problem with a very small test project.

Consider the two classes:
{code}
public abstract class AbstractPolygon {

    public static enum Color {
        RED,
        GREEN,
        BLUE;
    }

    private final Color color;
    private final int sides;

    public AbstractPolygon (final Color color, final int sides) {
        this.color = color;
        this.sides = sides;
    }
}

public class Triangle extends AbstractPolygon {

    private final double angle1;
    private final double angle2;

    public Triangle (final Color color, final double angle1, final double angle2) {
        super(color, 3);
        this.angle1 = angle1;
        this.angle2 = angle2;
    }
}
{code}

The above java code is valid, yet the ScalaDoc tool will complain processing {{Triangle.java}} saying:
{quote}error: not found: type Color{quote}

I have attached a sample project that recreates the issue.  Simply do the following to reproduce:  {{mvn clean install site}}

Note that a workaround is to explicitly import the enum.  So, for {{Triangle.java}}, ScalaDoc will work if the following is added:
{code}
import com.acme.AbstractPolygon.Color;
{code}
(Unfortunately, then this creates a style issue in the Java code since that import is not necessary.)

I just ran into this with Java8's Stream Collector.  This may become more of a problem as it is now happening with a Java standard library interface.

Example:

{code:java}
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.function.BiConsumer;
import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;
import java.util.function.Function;
import java.util.function.Supplier;
import java.util.stream.Collector;
public class MyCollector implements Collector<Object, Object, Object> {
    @Override
    public Supplier<Object> supplier() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public BiConsumer<Object, Object> accumulator() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public BinaryOperator<Object> combiner() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Function<Object, Object> finisher() {
        return null;
    }

    /***
     * This breaks, because of Characteristics isn't directly imported.
     * 
     */
    @Override
    public Set<Characteristics> characteristics() {
        return null;
    }
}
{code}
probably related to SI-1409
