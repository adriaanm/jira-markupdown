Comparing with version 2.8.1.final too many methods have been removed from Enumeration:
I can understand the removal of the concurrency methods( wait, notify etc) and the odd names with $$ and _ signs
 which I don't know what they are for (they look like internal methods which shouldn't have been exposed).

But I don't understand the removal of the useful ones (mostly typical list methods) like:

value
valueOf
equals
exists
filter
flatmap
forAll
foreach
getClass
hashCode
iterator
map
name
nextId
nextName
readResolve
valueOf

Because of the missing of "valueOf" I found this difference. 
Btw: I mentioned nextId, nextName and readResolve for completeness but I don't know what they are for.

I have one more question though, because I don't know what the "rule" is in scalac concerning deprecated apis.

When I compile this file which uses a deprecated valueOf method I get an error but some other deprecated apis get a message with "run scalac with -deprecation" or alike

{code}
C:\scala-2.9.0.RC5\examples>scalac scalaenums.scala
scalaenums.scala:8: error: value valueOf is not a member of object scalaenums.We
ekDay
   println(WeekDay.valueOf("Wed")) // returns Some(Wed)
                   ^
one error found
{code}

I reopen this ticket because I am not sure if the ticket can be seen by you if I post on a closed ticket.
Okay thanks, deprecated in 2.8.1.final
Probably people who skip some versions of Scala will miss the deprecation warning, though.

Also deprecated in 2.8.0.  The last version it appeared undeprecated was 2.7.7.  If the people missing those warnings thought they could jump from 2.7.7 to 2.9.0 and recompile, they were going to have to find out otherwise anyway.
