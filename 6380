This isn't fixed in 2.9.1.RC1. So it is still a bug.
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def numbers(isPar: Boolean): scala.collection.GenSeq[Int] = if (isPar) (1 to 256).par else 1 to 256
numbers: (isPar: Boolean)scala.collection.GenSeq[Int]

scala> numbers(true) map { _ => Thread.currentThread.getName } groupBy (x => x) map (x => (x._1, x._2.length)) foreach println
(Thread-9,256)
```

Aleksandar fixed that in r25235 but it was apparently not yet chosen for 2.9.1 probably also because I didn't report the bug earlier.
