scala.concurrent.duration.Duration.Inf is a specific instance - i.e. 
{code:scala}
val Inf: Infinite = new Infinite {
    override def toString = "Duration.Inf"
    def compare(other: Duration) = other match {
      case x if x eq Undefined => -1 // Undefined != Undefined
      case x if x eq this      => 0  // `case Inf` will include null checks in the byte code
      case _                   => 1
    }
    def unary_- : Duration = MinusInf
    def toUnit(unit: TimeUnit): Double = Double.PositiveInfinity
  }
{code}
This all works brilliantly unless you send it from one VM to another (say via a remote Akka call). If you do, it creates a *new* "Duration.Inf" instance, so now it is no longer a singleton in the receiving VM.

If you then pass this new Duration.Inf into Await.result or something you receive a MatchError in scala.concurrent.impl.Promise.tryAwait(...)  here:
{code:scala}
    /** Try waiting for this promise to be completed.
     */
    protected final def tryAwait(atMost: Duration): Boolean = if (!isCompleted) {
      import Duration.Undefined
      import scala.concurrent.Future.InternalCallbackExecutor
      atMost match {
        case e if e eq Undefined => throw new IllegalArgumentException("cannot wait for Undefined period")
        case Duration.Inf        =>
          val l = new CompletionLatch[T]()
          onComplete(l)(InternalCallbackExecutor)
          l.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1)
        case Duration.MinusInf   => // Drop out
        case f: FiniteDuration   =>
          if (f > Duration.Zero) {
            val l = new CompletionLatch[T]()
            onComplete(l)(InternalCallbackExecutor)
            l.tryAcquireSharedNanos(1, f.toNanos)
          }
      }

      isCompleted
    } else true // Already completed
{code}

i.e. It attempts to match the Duration.Inf instances and fails because they are different - and you end up with a confusing error saying "MatchError: Duration.Inf" even though there is clearly a match case for it.
I think overriding `readResolve` will solve this one.  Not _technically_ binary compatible, I don't think, but it's going to be awfully tricky to do it otherwise.  Only string identity is safe, and users might also employ the `eq Inf` pattern.
Minimization illustrating the problem:

{code}
val baos = new java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
val out = new java.io.ObjectOutputStream(baos)
out.writeObject(scala.concurrent.duration.Duration.Inf)
val bais = new java.io.ByteArrayInputStream( baos.toByteArray )
val in = new java.io.ObjectInputStream(bais)
in.readObject eq scala.concurrent.duration.Duration.Inf
{code}

This returns {{false}}, but should return {{true}}.
Well, the fix fixes the problem, but it's outrageously incompatible because the autogenerated serialVersionUID changes when you add readResolve.  So--boom!--you can't pass these around.  Finding and fixing every "eq Inf" is messy and painful.

It's _possible_, I guess, to ask ASM to rewrite the bytecode of scala.concurrent.duration.Duration$$anon$1 through 3 to contain a private static final long serialVersionUID of the right value.  But, ugh?
