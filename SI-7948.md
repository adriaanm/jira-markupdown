Flesh out the Future factory methods to include a method that accepts a Try.  At the moment we have Promise.success/Future.successful, Promise.fail/Future.failure, but we're missing the equivalent to Promise.complete.

Suggested: Future.completed.

e.g.
```scala
def completed[A](result: Try[A]): Future[A] = â€¦
```
