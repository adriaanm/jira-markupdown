Since I suggested effect, I feel qualified to recommend tap instead; it's shorter and gets the point across.

I don't like convert, because it's too long and things like `x.convert(_+2)` don't really seem like much of a conversion.  I like `pipe` or `ap` or `app` or `as` or `be` (not great grammar on that last one, but it's short and gets the point across...).
