Consider 

```scala
import com.j256.ormlite.field.DatabaseField

class Fail(@DatabaseField val missing: Int) {
  @DatabaseField val has = missing
}

```

javap -c -p -v Fail.class

```scala
  private final int missing;
    descriptor: I
    flags: ACC_PRIVATE, ACC_FINAL


  private final int has;
    descriptor: I
    flags: ACC_PRIVATE, ACC_FINAL
    RuntimeVisibleAnnotations:
      0: #12()
```

Same goes to case classes. Same problem with Gson. 
This is as expected. You need to use the meta-annotations in scala.annotation.meta (http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.annotation.meta.package)
```scala
class Fail(@(DatabaseField @scala.annotation.meta.field) val missing: Int) {
  @DatabaseField val has = missing
}
```
