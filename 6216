I agree with all you're saying.

Yes, it feels unnatural not to fix this bug. Making overloading resolution depend on a particular application is a language change that needs deep discussion and evaluation, so it's out of the scope of this ticket.

If there are ideas on how to simplify the spec with respect to `T*` and `=>T`, I and others would be happy to discuss.
