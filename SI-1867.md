In JDT, in the **New Java Project** wizard there is an option to *Create a project from existing source*. When this option is selected Eclipse will look at the specified directory and if there are Eclipse metadata files (.project, .classpath, etc) it will create a project using those files else it will create a new project and try to detect the correct source folders and buildpath from the contents for the directory.

It would be great if you could add this feature to the **New Scala Project** wizard.

BTW the detection of the structure of the existing project does not have to be perfect. If SDT creates the project the programmer can always edit the buildpath and add/remove source folders etc.

Please note that this is different from "File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace" that copies the files of the specified project into workspace.
Feel free to close this issue since it is actually a subtask of #2685.

Also when importing a project we can specify to eclipse not to copy the files so my comment in the report does not hold.
Duplicate of (part of) #2685.
