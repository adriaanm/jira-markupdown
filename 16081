h2. What steps will reproduce the problem?
Look at some code, most probably it will have something like {{`foo'}} in the comments. This breaks formatting, because ScalaDoc2 only fully supports {{`foo`}}

h2. What is the expected behavior?
Fix the comments.

h2. What do you see instead?
Code using the legacy quotes.
