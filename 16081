## What steps will reproduce the problem?
Look at some code, most probably it will have something like ``foo'` in the comments. This breaks formatting, because ScalaDoc2 only fully supports ``foo``

## What is the expected behavior?
Fix the comments.

## What do you see instead?
Code using the legacy quotes.
