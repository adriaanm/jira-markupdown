The warning is correct, because the types of Yes1/Yes2/No1/No2 are "Boolean", they are not true constants - so you haven't actually covered any of the boolean space. It goes away with Ints because the pattern matcher doesn't aspire to exhaustively checking four billion values, but it can check two.

Declare the constants so they will be seen as such, and the warning goes away:
{code}
final val Yes1 = true
final val Yes2 = true
final val No1 = false
final val No2 = false
{code}
