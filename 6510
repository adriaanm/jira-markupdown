My first attempt at detecting {{LOAD_MODULE}} that DCE can eliminate:

{noformat}
    case LOAD_MODULE(mdl) =>
      // TODO a Dataflow Analysis could track on which paths the class initializer has been run.
      val necessary = mdl.info.member(nme.CONSTRUCTOR).filter(isSideEffecting) != NoSymbol
      if(necessary) { worklist += ((bb, idx)) }
{noformat}

But it also considers {{Predef}} as "necessary". Ideas?
