XMLEventReader does not produce !EvEntityRef xml events. This is illustrated by this sample session:
```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r19070-b20091013021844 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_13).

scala> val er = new
scala.xml.pull.XMLEventReader(scala.io.Source.fromString("<foo>1 &lt;2</foo>"))
er: scala.xml.pull.XMLEventReader = non-empty iterator

scala> while (er.hasNext) { println(er.next) }
EvElemStart(null,foo,,)
EvText(1 )
EvText( 2)
EvElemEnd(null,foo)
```

No !EvEntityRef is printed.

  fixed bug in implicit resolution that only manifested itself when multiple implicit arguments needed to be resolved and they were intended to instantiate type parameters
  
  two problems:
   - type parameters that could not be inferred where removed from undetparams erroneously
   - the successfully inferred parameters were not propagated to the the implicit arguments on the right (implicit resolution searches for implicit arguments from left to right, fixing type parameters in the process)
  
  this should give the green light for the addition of Zipped to TupleN

  Breaks down the hash function in BoxesRunTime by type so we can
  do as much as possible at compile time.  Documents various trouble
  points I've identified with trying to get the hashCodes aligned.
  Test case exercises the hashCode functions.
  
  Deleted all the code associated with previous equality adventures.
  Don't worry, I can put anything back if it turns out we have to
  change course again, but for now it's noise.
  
  Also, gives return types to the box and unbox methods which are
  added to the primitive companions, so e.g. Int.box(5) now returns
  a j.l.Integer instead of an Object.
