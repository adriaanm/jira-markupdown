I don't know if someone else ever reported this - guessing not - I'll just throw it in here as the closest thing to an applicable ticket. Fair warning, this is probably a slide in every talk I give until I die or it is changed, whichever comes first.

```scala
class Bippy(override val toString: String)

trait A            { implicit def lowPriority: Bippy  = new Bippy("A") }
object B extends A { implicit def highPriority: Bippy = new Bippy("B") }
object C           { implicit def highPriority: Bippy = new Bippy("C") }

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    import B._, C._
    println( implicitly[Bippy] ) // Prints: A
  }
}
```
