```scala
scala> new Date("1981/08/07") <= new Date()
<console>:7: warning: comparing a fresh object using `<=' will always yield false
       new Date("1981/08/07") <= new Date()
                              ^
res0: Boolean = true
```

what happened: I added the <= method to java.util.Date with implicits, but when testing my code in the interpreter, I got this warning:
```scala
<console>:7: warning: comparing a fresh object using `<=' will always yield false
```

what expected: no warning

For completeness, rest of code:
```scala
trait Ord[T] {
  def <= (other: T): Boolean
}

import java.util.Date

implicit def dateAsOrd(self: Date) = new Ord[Date] {
  def <= (other: Date) = self.equals(other) || self.before(other)
}
```
