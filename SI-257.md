As defined in Syntax Summary and start of Chapter 6:

```scala
  ResultExpr ::= Expr1
               | (Bindings | Id ‘:’ CompoundType) ‘=>’ Block
```

However in Section 6.23 (Anonymous Functions) the second alternative is defined as:

```scala
  ResultExpr ::= (Bindings | Id [‘:’ CompoundType]) ‘=>’ Block
```

I think the latter is correct.

----

Also in 6.23 this appears as 'Expr1'

```scala
  Expr1 ::= (Bindings | Id) ‘=>’ Expr
```

However elsewhere this definition is part of 'Expr'

```scala
  Expr ::= [(Bindings | Id) ‘=>’] Expr
         | Expr1
```

So I think the 'Expr1' in 6.23 should be 'Expr'

Finally a question: why is it not 

```scala
  Expr ::= (Bindings | Id [':' CompoundType]) ‘=>’ Expr
```
For `ResultExpr`
, the latter is actually correct: “{{{ a => }}}” is rejected by the compiler (missing parameter type).

As for your question: I am not sure I can answer precisely: maybe you'll want to ask the question on the newsgroup. But my intuition is that since we are in a block, this syntax allows us to read the “=>” as “and from now on, execute the block only when applied”. For example:

```scala
{
  println(2)
  println(3)
a: Int =>
  println(4)
  println(a)
}
```

May be read as “print 2 and 3 once, when the block is created, and then print 4 and a whenever the block is applied”.

Otherwise, one would have to write:

```scala
{
  println(2)
  println(3)
  a: Int => {
    println(a)
    println(a*2)
  }
}
```

which is marginally uglier.
