There are some highly annoying limitations on where you can put {{_}} to create an expanded function. They don't seem to follow any obvious logic, which makes me think the cases that do work have been special-case hacked so that they work properly, rather than fixing more generally: Take a look:

{code}
scala> val x = Seq(4,5,6)
x: Seq[Int] = List(4, 5, 6)

scala> x.map { math.log(_) }
res0: Seq[Double] = List(1.3862943611198906, 1.6094379124341003, 1.791759469228055)

scala> x.map { math.log(_ * 2) }
<console>:10: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => x$1.$times(2))
              x.map { math.log(_ * 2) }
                               ^
{code}

The potential ambiguity here is whether to expand {{_ * 2}} into a function  {{x => x * 2}} (wrong) or to expand {{math.log(_ * 2)}}. into a function {{x => math.log(x * 2)}} (right). Once you make the right expansion, type inference works fine. Evidently it decides to make the nearest-enclosing expansion, probably in all circumstances except in cases like {{_}} directly as a function argument, which is special-cased to not be expandable to a function by itself.

In this case, the {{math.log()}} function cannot possibly accept a function of any sort as its one argument, so correctly resolving the ambiguity should be trivial. But in fact this doesn't happen. I imagine the response might be something like "because of Scala implementation choices, the type info isn't available at the time we need to expand functions", but IMO this is rather non-optimal, as it justifies a language issue on an implementation issue -- and one that almost certainly is fixable in this case.

Plans to fix this? This bites me constantly and would be a major win. Fixes would be awesome.
The translation of the placeholder syntax for anonymous functions is purely syntactic, and can't be influenced by the types. I don't believe that your proposal could be specified in simple manner.

About all we could do would be to tweak the error message to offer a hint based on the context: in your example we could detect that we are typechecking the argument to an application which itself is the argument of a of a higher-order function and it looks like the types won't line up. But you might well have an implicit from `Double => (Any => T)` that means that the types *could* line up; it's hard to give accurate messages about applications after type errors in the arguments.
Moreover, the syntactic behavior is very simple and regular.

It would be nice to emit a message that dispels any impression that the behavior is non-obvious or a "hack".

Maybe it would require a verbose mode to add the two rules from the spec, possibly translated from Specese into Noobian.
