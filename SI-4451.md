=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Take http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.html as an example:

First we have:
`class List [+A] extends LinearSeq[A] with Product with GenericTraversableTemplate[A, List] with LinearSeqOptimized[A, List[A]]`

and multiple lines later: 
`Attributes    sealed abstract`


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The "sealed abstract" should be in front of "class List[...]"


=== What do you see instead? ===
It is somewhere else.

=== Additional information ===
The rationale for this is that reading things like "class" has some implicit meaning (you can do a "new", you can subclass) and it would be good to make sure that this holds (and not "you might be able to create an instance of it, depending on if there are some 'attributes' listed somewhere else.")

It shouldn't be necessary to scroll around to find out if "class" is actually "class" or maybe "final class", "abstract class" etc.

Imagine if the documentation wasn't as short as in "List", if people have to actually scroll to the bottom to find that out.
