The following code creates a spurious warning (because of the concatenated string):
```scala
@implicitNotFound("not found ${H}”+".") trait X[H]
```

```scala
possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
[warn] @implicitNotFound("not found ${H}"+".") trait X[H]
```

The warning disappears if we write
```scala
@implicitNotFound("not found ${H}.") trait X[H]
```

In my original code I broke the message in 2 because it was too long.
This is #7411.
Slight progressive mitigation:
```scala
$ scala -Xlint

                         ^

It still warns if there is a value with the name of your type param.
@SethTisue While this is related to #7411 I don't think it's a duplicate. That ticket is calling for a general cleanup in the area, but isn't reporting a bug as such. This ticket on the other hand is reporting a very specific bug.
Seeing as it's not just me I'll reopen and unduplicate. @SethTisue reclose if you disagree.
