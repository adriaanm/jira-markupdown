Judging from the lack of strong reactions against getting rid of this item in https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/q1YX7NC1geM/discussion I think we can create an issue to track it.
```scala
trait Foo { def foo }
abstract Bar { def bar }
```

The fact that this is accepted by the compiler is incredibly surprising, because it goes against the intuition that the compiler needs either a body to infer the type or an explicit type annotation.

Adding to the unintuitiveness is that in most cases where a type is missing the compiler infers Nothing (for better or worse), but doesn't do it here.

The suggestion is to deprecate the syntax for 2.11 and start requiring a type in 2.12:
```scala
trait Foo { def foo: Unit }
abstract Bar { def bar: Unit }
```

The behaviour is described in chapter 4.6.3 of the spec. Getting rid of this special-cased behaviour would allow getting rid of the whole chapter.
