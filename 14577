Hi,

I just read your installation instructions and installed a fresh copy of Eclipse 3.5 (build 20090920-1017) and JDK 1.6.0 Update 16. Also I installed Scala 2.7.6 Plugin via Software Install from Eclipse. Then I tried the verification steps you offer on your website:

When I start Eclipse and switch to scala perspective I can create a Scala-project and a package. But when I try to create an object I get an empty dialog (no entry fields) and nothing happens when I click "Finish". When I try to create an scala application I get a dialog box where I can enter the application name but again clicking "finish" does nothing.

What's wrong?

Regards
Duffy
