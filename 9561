I raised a question that lead to this bug http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16294822/constructors-in-scala-with-varargs

In Java I need varargs in order to make any thing even slightly approaching a DSL (mostly in tests). I don't know if the need is as great in Scala. 

The example in the link shows what I think is a sensible use of varargs. I have an alternative implementation using Lists, but the code is much more verbose and not nearly as readable. I'd really appreciate some idiomatically correct code that did the same thing as the example not using val p:Int*
