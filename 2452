This bug appears to be fixed in r20397.

**Testing procedure**
 1. Create a class with the name BitSet
 2. Compile the class by saving the file
 3. Delete the BitSet class from the editor and save the file
 4. Import scala.collection.BitSet
 5. Use the BitSet in a class defined in the file

As the result of the above no bogus warning messages appears.
