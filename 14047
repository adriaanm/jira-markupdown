The current temporary directory for FSC is ~/tmp.  This works fine on Windows XP, where the home directory is never used.  However, it can be *extremely* annoying on Mac, Linux and Windows Vista/7.  It would be nice if FSC would use either the system-conventional temporary directory (e.g. /tmp), or a hidden configuration directory (i.e. ~/.fsc on *nix, ~/AppData/Local/fsc on Windows Vista/7, ~/Application Support/fsc on Windows XP).
