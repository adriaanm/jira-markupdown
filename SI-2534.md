While investigating #2236, I discovered this:
```scala
object o {
  implicit val imp: Int = 10
  class A(implicit val param: Int)
  class B extends A
}
```
This does not compile, though it'd be rather difficult for param to be available to pass to itself:
```scala
c.scala:4: error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both value param in class A of type => Int
 and value imp in object o of type => Int
 match expected type Int
  class B extends A
          ^
```
I would expect it to behave more like this, which works:
```scala
object o {
  implicit val imp: Int = 10
  class A(implicit _param: Int) { val param = _param }
  class B extends A
}
```
This appears to be the underlying cause of the VerifyError in #2236, with the construction of B trying to retrieve the implicit value from not-yet-with-us superclass A.
As anticipated this is fixed with #2236 in r19434.
