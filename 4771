The casting is not broken.  Array[Object] is the erasure of Array[AnyVal], which is the inferred type of the pattern match.  You are letting it be boxed and then trying to cast the boxed array.  Here is a version which works, and it's really not cool to use trac for support.
{code}
  def mkArray[T <: A](atype: Int): T#AType = {
    atype match {
      case 1  => new Array[Int](10).asInstanceOf[T#AType]
      case 2  => new Array[Float](10).asInstanceOf[T#AType]
    }
{code}
