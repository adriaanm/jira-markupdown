Bill Pugh showed me some interesting bugs found by findBugs in Scala's standard library:

`if (s == null)` generates calls to `.equals(null)` which findBugs complains about. Maybe that should be a warning in scalac, instructing the user to use reference equality instead:

{code}
s eq null
{code}

I'd rather not use eq to check for null. eq has a horribly high precedence that almost always requires the use of braces. == has a much lower precedence that requires fewer braces.

Really? What do you prefer?

{{if (x == null && y != null) }}

or

{{if ((x eq null) && (y ne null))}}

As far as I'm concerned, use a real operator (==) and only use eq/ne when you really have to, otherwise you'll have to write a whole bunch of parens and your code will look like Lisp.
Replying to [comment:6 odersky]: 
> 1) I learned a rule from Corky Cartwright that you should never compare against null. The idea is that `null' should mean undefined value, not something you can test for. So it's OK to pass null as a don't care parameter, say, but nobody should ever test for null.

May I ask (and I realize the scala compiler has been written by numerous people and that your team is overworked, I'm not intending to be judgmental) if this is something you hope/intend to address? The widespread usage of null in the scala source has been something of a disappointment to me.
{code}
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep '!= null'  |wc -l
     211
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep '== null'  |wc -l
     141
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep 'ne null'  |wc -l
     282
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep 'eq null'  |wc -l
     215
{code}
Three reasons I can see:

- Raw performance (sometimes this matters)
- Interfacing with existing libraries (for instance in the jcl)
- Different people have different conventions. 

Not that we should not try to reduce null tests...
