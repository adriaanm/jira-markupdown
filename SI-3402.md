Given the current state of API documentation, it simply takes too much effort to find the right solution for common application use cases. 

While some packages and classes (see _elidable_ or _Bitset_) do have a sufficient description most lack any (see _scala.runtime.Abstractfunction_, _scala.xml.parsing_ or _transform_). So in my opinion, the API documentation needs a major overhaul before scala promoters like me could recommend java folks implementing (parts of) their applications with scala. 

Packages, classes/traits/objects and methodes should be described in a use-case-oriented way garnished with examples and useful links and be, please, sceduled near-time. 

Over the course of the past 6 months, several community efforts have done *a lot* to improve the quality of the API docs. And this improvement process still continues, especially now with Scala source on github.

So, I think it's safe to close this ticket, as it's been a long and ongoing effort that certainly doesn't seem to be diminishing.
