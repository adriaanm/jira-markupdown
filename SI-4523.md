=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
Compile the attached code with Scala 2.9.0.RC2 - it will hang in the icode phase. Additionally the compiler log reports the explicitouter phase is running extremely long:
[info] [explicitouter in 154378ms] 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
It should compile just as it compiles with Scala 2.9.0.RC1

(In r24851) Fixing the pattern matcher regression I introduced between rc1 and rc2.
Not done with this situation but at least I managed to boil out the big
problem and keep my five closed pattern matcher tickets to boot.
Closes SI-4523, no review.
