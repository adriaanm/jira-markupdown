I'm only able to keep my Eclipse session (old plugin) open for about an half an hour now before I get the out of PermSpace memory errors under Mac OS. My heap is set at 1GB. Its gotten much worse, qualitatively, in 2.7.0. The plugin is approaching unusable. 

Could someone run some tools to search for memory leaks in the compiler? Barring that, you could test the resident compiler disabling various phases, starting from just doing parsing and typing, seeing how long resident lasts, and if it lasts for multiple builds, re-enabling various down the line phases.
