Consider the following code:

{code}
case class annot[T] extends StaticAnnotation

// type inference should infer @annot[Nothing] instead of @annot[T]
// note the T is not in scope here!
class Foo[@annot U] {
  val x = new Foo
}
{code}

Compilation succeeds, but crashes if I pass `-Ycheck:ref` to scalac. If you wonder about a use case, it's for `@specialized`, which I'd like to be able to use with no type arguments.
