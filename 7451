{{runtime.BoxesRunTime.hashFromDouble(d)}} still returns the wrong value. Should that also be fixed, or is this method no longer used anywhere (in the context of {{##}})?
I claim that `hashFromDouble` should also check whether the argument can be represented correctly within a float and then return that hashCode.
```scala
scala> runtime.BoxesRunTime.hashFromNumber(d)
res16: Int = 1139802112

scala> runtime.BoxesRunTime.hashFromNumber(d.toFloat)
res17: Int = 1602224128

scala> d == d.toFloat
res18: Boolean = true
```
