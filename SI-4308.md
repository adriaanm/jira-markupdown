=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===
```scala
Long.MinValue to Long.MaxValue
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
```scala
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Seqs cannot contain more than Int.MaxValue elements.
```

(Probably)

=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange.Inclusive[Long] = NumericRange()
```


=== Additional information ===
Very likely related to #3232.

It would be a good idea to think about how to better test these things. I guess this Range bug won't be the last ...

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r24343-b20110224020040
I just verified it with BigInt too. 
The check fails for inclusive ranges where end == -(start+1). 

The bug is in NumericRange.count:

```scala
193	    val longCount: Long =
194	      if (start == end) { if (isInclusive) 1 else 0 }
195	      else if (end > start != step > zero) 0
196	      else {
197	        val jumps     = toLong((end - start) / step) // <-------
198	        val remainder = toLong((end - start) % step)
199	       
200	        if (!isInclusive && zero == remainder) jumps
201	        else jumps + 1L
202	      }
203	   
204	    if (longCount > scala.Int.MaxValue || longCount < 0L)
205	      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Seqs cannot contain more than Int.MaxValue elements.")
```
Just like #4321, this one seems for Paul.
(In r24508) Some boundary conditions in range.  Also bit the bullet on getting
infix implicits to Integral and Fractional.  As a bonus this patch
knocked 10,000 long boxings off a specialized test.  Who knew.
Closes #4308, #4321, review by community.
