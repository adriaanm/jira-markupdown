I'd recommend asking on Stack Overflow or scala-user for work arounds, as we don't really support GAE (although we'd like to). 

[EDIT: please ignore the rest of this comment -- it was more of a stream of consciousness than anything else]

My un-educated guess is that this is because we ship with our own copy of the fork join implementation, since we target Java 6. It looks like GAE requires using the one that comes with the/their jdk. I'll ask around for a work around.

Could you try this suggestion from SO? http://stackoverflow.com/a/20627692/276895

Specifically, create an execution context that uses the jdk's fork join. It would be better if this just worked, though.

{code}
implicit val execCtx = scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext fromExecutorService new java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool
{code}

Sorry, I see you're already doing this. Missed that lineâ€¦

Looks like my diagnosis was wrong again, it's another use of Unsafe in AbstractPromise, as you say in the title. I'll go have some more coffee now and leave it to the experts.
