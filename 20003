Calling a {{merged}} method on {{scala.collection.immutable.HashMap.HashMap1}} object whose {{kv}} is null throws a {{NullPointerException}}. Normally, the {{kv}} field of {{HashMap1}} object is set (or is lazily initialized with {{ensurePair}} call before it is actually used) but it is possible for it to be null - one case I know of is when a {{HashMap1}} object is deserialized.
