I hadn't really thought about implicits when this was dreamed up, but now it seems like a big problem.  There's just no way to see this as anything but a regression:
{code}
scala> case class Foo[T: Ordering](x: T)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(5)
res0: Foo[Int] = Foo(5)

scala> res0.copy(x = 10)
res1: Ordering[Int] => Foo[Int] = <function1>
{code}
