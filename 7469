For an interesting change of pace, this works nicely in the repl despite crashing scalac.  The repl doesn't actually get the credit though, it's a product of nesting.  This compiles.
{code}
object Foo {
  case class Bomb(a: Array[_])
  case class Bomb2(a: Array[T] forSome { type T })
  class Okay1(a: Array[_])
  case class Okay2(s: Seq[_])
}
{code}
