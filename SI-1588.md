With the latest stable release of the plugin (2.7.2), I am unable to use the forward delete key on Mac (Fn+Delete on Apple laptops).  This "feature" works fine in other Eclipse editors.
I was able to test this recently with 2.7.2.final on a Mac laptop and forward delete appears to work perfectly. Can you provide a more detailed recipe for reproducing the problem?

Steps are as follows:

1. Open Scala editor on a file (any file)
2. Cursor left of a character
3. Press Fn+Delete
4. Commence helpless range

I've *never* had forward delete work for me on Mac.  This is Mac OS X 10.5.5, Eclipse 3.4.1 with Maclipse.
Thanks for the update. Can you try again with a vanilla (ie. not Maclipse) Eclipse Classic 3.4.1 install and 2.7.2.final.

As I said, I tried exactly what you described and it worked without problem. It will be extremely helpful if you're able to help me diagnose why this isn't working for you.
