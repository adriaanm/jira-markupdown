Currently I am evaluating scala as a core of a messaging system with both messages send to objects internal and external to the virtual machine.

I wanted to measure the performance, however, run into an error which seems to be critical.

The attached example (sorry for exceeding the 24 line limit) is working fine, even under a heavy load iff I use  ` while(true){receive{ ...` in the `Actors act ` method. No problem to send 20,000,000 messages and more. Program stops, every worker terminates.

However, if I change to ` loop {react { `, even for medium loads the program fails, because 25-30% of the workers stop unexpectedly.

Environment: {code}
scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.7.2.final -- Copyright 2002-2008, LAMP/EPFL

java -version
java version "1.6.0_0"
OpenJDK  Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_0-b11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.6.0_0-b11, mixed mode)
{code}

I attached the working version, please change the `act ` method to reproduce the bug.
