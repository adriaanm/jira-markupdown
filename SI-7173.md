The problem has been mentioned here:
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/b95Y-GbXVGA/discussion

The gist is that typer inlines compile time constants (e.g. references to static fields defined in Java) and forgets about the original tree that referred to a constant (e.g. to a field) which makes dependency analysis impossible.

According to Adriaan pattern matcher does not need constants to be inlined because it works with types. I couldn't readily find a reason why we need to inline those constants in typer so we probably should move this all the way to erasure.

I'm logging a ticket to not forget to investigate if we can do that for 2.10.2.
It turns out that this is causing problems not only for dependency analysis.

The improved incremental compiler I'm working on relies on extracting used names in a given compilation unit. Once constant gets inlined we do not have access to the field that defined it therefore we can't extract its name.

I thought I could work-around it by inspecting symbol names of symbols in `CompilationUnit.depends` but we have only top-level classes recorded there, see:
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Infer.scala#L263

Therefore I believe there's no other way than just fix the underlaying issue.

According to Adriaan we could perform constant inlining and folding based purely on types and leave trees intact. We still want constants to be folded in the bytecode so we could replace trees having constant types with actual constants in some later phase like erasure. This is an interesting idea that I would like to try out at some point.
Does this still affect 2.11 and 2.12 versions? I think it does.

The following [test](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/1543) in Zinc is failing because of it. Could someone confirm this hasn't been fixed in new Scala versions and set those versions in the ticket?

This constant inlining could be perjudicial for a lot of Zinc users that make intense use of final vals. I think it would make sense to fix this and I'd be happy to take a stab at it. I'd like to know if @adriaanm or @retronym would accept such a PR for next 2.12.x and 2.11.x series (if there's to a be a new version for 2.11). A time estimate to fix this would also be very useful to pick the appropriate moment to implement it. I think this could be a blocker for a fully stable Zinc 1.0 release (though we could probably live with it since it depends on the compiler).
This will probably interact with the [literal types PR](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5310) ... please take a close look at that if/when working on this.
I think at least some of [pull/4880](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4880) was folded into the literal types PR.
I have a partial workaround for this [here](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/issues/227).
In the long term, I'll try to follow up on Adriaan's work to only use types to inline constants.
