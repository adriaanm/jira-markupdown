I'd love to see a proposal 2 implemented. I'd suggest:

# Create {{valueMap}} and {{keyFilter}} that are strict versions of the above.
# Deprecate {{mapValues}} and {{filterKeys}}, adding a deprecation note that users should use {{.view.mapValues}} and {{.view.filterKeys}} respectively.

This would keep the library standardized, supplying only strict implementations, allowing users to explicitly use non-strict versions if they see fit.
