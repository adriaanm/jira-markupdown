=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
In scala 2.7.7, @BeanProperty was allowed on private fields. In 2.8.1, this is no longer allowed.

```scala
@scala.reflect.BeanProperty private var test: Int = _
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Allow @BeanProperty on private fields.

One reason to use getters and setters is to hide implementation details. The field should be allowed to be private, otherwise it can "leak out" and be accessed directly, and become part of the ABI of the class.

=== What do you see instead? ===

```scala
<console>:5: error: `BeanProperty' annotation can only be applied to non-private fields
```


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: linux
`@BeanProperty` is a Java-compatibility tool, it helps you integrating your Scala code with certain Java frameworks.  The generated `set*` and `get*` methods are just aliases for the Scala getter and setter, and they will have the same visibility.

If you want custom getters or setters, you have to write them manually. It's true that this then does not integrate nicely with `@BeanProperty`, this problem has been identified before (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/scala-user/beanproperty/scala-user/CQv2OXttTm8/OvFKJ4-Mf4EJ).

Thank you for your comments. I feel your scala-user thread reinforces my position. I am not asking to be able to customize the accessors; I was giving examples of why it is important to allow private vars.

My observation in scala 2.8.1 is that the scala accessors take on the visibility of the var, but the Bean accessors are always public.

Using scala -print, if I make my var protected, I see:

```scala
    @scala.reflect.BeanProperty private[this] var test: Int = _;
    protected <accessor> def test(): Int = line5$$object$$$$iw$$$$iw.this.test;
    protected <accessor> def test_=(x$$1: Int): Unit = line5$$object$$$$iw$$$$iw.this.test = x$$1;
    def setTest(x$$1: Int): Unit = line5$$object$$$$iw$$$$iw.this.test = x$$1;
    def getTest(): Int = line5$$object$$$$iw$$$$iw.this.test();
```

getTest and setTest are public (as they should be IMO).

I really just want to know why private is disallowed. I found your comment in the compiler source, "avoids name clashes with private fields in traits." That's unsatisfying. I promise to not name a private field "setTest" in any trait I inherit from!

Yes, the problem with this solution is that it's wrong. When you have two traits with two private variables of the same name, and both have `@BeanProperty`, and then you mix them into one class, you get a conflict.
