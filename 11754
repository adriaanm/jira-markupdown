List is not the only thing that uses this pattern.  List got its inspiration from immutable.HashMap and others.

This may happen in a lot more places than List.

what happens if we change
```scala
val is = new ObjectInputStream(s)
```

to use a custom extended ObjectInputStream that either overrides that method or changes 'latestUserDefinedLoader'?

If that works, it would be a work-around on the user side -- not much we can do here if something beyond our control is trying to load classes it can't see.
