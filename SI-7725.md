repeated ++ of a single-item collection onto a Vector is outrageously slow compared to repeatedly adding one item with + :

Paul Chiusano pointed this out over at #4442, where he comments: "Since Vector has a constant time snoc operation, it seems like the default implementation of ++ should be repeated calls to :+, which doesn't require any internal changes to Vector."
If the first vector is very short and the second vector is very long, both old code and proposed new code will run in O\(n\) time, but yes, the new code will have worse constant factors:

```
import System.{currentTimeMillis => millis}
def time[T](f: => T): Long = { val start = millis; f; millis - start }
def repeat[T](n: Int)(body: => T): Unit = for(_ <- 0 until n) body
def fix[T](v1: Vector[T], v2: Vector[T]): Vector[T] = v2.foldLeft(v1)(_ :+ _)
val big = Vector.range(1,100000)
val small = Vector(1)
def test() {
  println("before fix")
  println(time(repeat(100)(big ++ big)))
  println(time(repeat(100)(big ++ small)))
  println(time(repeat(100)(small ++ big)))
  println("after fix")
  println(time(repeat(100)(fix(big, big))))
  println(time(repeat(100)(fix(big, small))))
  println(time(repeat(100)(fix(small, big))))
}

But I don't think this should bother us more than slightly. I think getting asymptotic speedup on `big ++ small` is clearly worth a constant slowdown in `small ++ big`.
Well, hmm. I'd be wary of heuristics here as the results could vary a lot depending on the environment. And, the more moving parts, the more potential for error. I'd suggest the simplest, most robust possible fix for 2.10.x, namely the fold, and then leave the door open for later refinement in 2.11, on a separate ticket. But I can see it's debatable.

I would argue that the performance of `Vector.++` is only likely to be a performance bottleneck if it is called repeatedly on the same Vector; that typically concatenation proceeds left-to-right; and that under those conditions, `big ++ small` is the main case and `small ++ big` is an edge case; it's the former that will dominate performance in typical use. Finally, if anyone is really harmed by the constant-factor slowdown in the `small ++ big` case, they can always use VectorBuilder themselves and do it their way.
What happened to the research by Tiark Rompf / Phil Bagwell with the *logarithmic cost* concatenation?
That's #4442. This is #7725. FOCUS
"if you knew how", that's the rub â€” and that's #4442.
This outperforms ++ in cases where there is a significant mismatch, but is about 20-30% slower for merging big vectors (on my machine), probably because the JIT compiler doesn't quite optimize as much since it has more work to do.  (Specialized on `String` only for testing, but results should hold for generic case.)

I'll probably go with something like this barring radically superior ideas.

(Note: I'm converting to Vector in the non-re-Traversable case in the hope that we'll get better-than-O(n) concat in Vector someday.  Maybe from me, but don't count on it.)

```
(a: Vector[String], b: GenTraversableOnce[String]) => {
  if (b.isEmpty) a
  else if (!b.isTraversableAgain) {
    val c = b.toVector
    if (c.size < (a.size >> 5)) { var v = a; for (x <- c) v = v :+ x; v }
    else if (a.size < (c.size >> 5)) { var v = c; for (x <- a.reverseIterator) v = x +: v; v }
    else a ++ c
  }
  else b.size match {
    case n if n < 3 || n < (a.size >> 5) => var v = a; for (x <- b) v = v :+ x; v
    case n if a.size < (n >> 5) && b.isInstanceOf[Vector[_]] =>
      var v = b.asInstanceOf[Vector[String]]; for (x <- a.reverseIterator) v = x +: v; v
    case _ => a ++ b
  }
}
```
