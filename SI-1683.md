I was working on bug SI-84 and the first thing I noticed was that it doesn't do that.  So I thought someone had fixed it, but investigation revealed that fsc never reused a compiler instance even on identical consecutive commands, so of course stale cache entries were not a problem.

The reason is this: before reusing a compiler instance, CompileServer verifies that the settings are identical by calling the custom equals method in Settings, which does this:
{code}
List.forall2 (this.allSettings, s.allSettings)(_==_)
{code}
This is a very interesting trap, because all the relevant fields of all the settings are indeed equal, but this still always returns false -- in fact no two settings ever compare equal.  The reason is that the logic of the equals methods looks like this:
{code}
    override def equals(that: Any) = that match {
      case bs: BooleanSetting => this.name == bs.name && this.value == bs.value
      case _ => false
    }
{code}
The individual Setting (singular) objects being compared were born in two different Settings (plural) objects, so they are not the same class, and the case bs: BooleanSetting always fails.  It should instead look like this:
{code}
    override def equals(that: Any) = that match {
      case bs: Settings#BooleanSetting => this.name == bs.name && this.value == bs.value
      case _ => false
    }
{code}

I have attached a patch against trunk that fixes this issue -- and with that applied I'm "happy" to say that bug SI-84 is still a valid bug.  This took me a long time to figure out and seems like a very easy trap to fall into, so I wonder if anyone has ideas as to how to make it harder to burn yourself this way.
DRMacIver points out that isInstanceOf draws the opposite conclusion.  I think either that is wrong, or the type matching behavior is wrong.  Here is a demonstration.
{code}
class Settings {
  val settings: List[Setting] = List(Setting1("bob"))
  
  abstract class Setting(descr: String) {
    def name: String
  }
  
  case class Setting1(name: String) extends Setting("foo") {
    override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
      case x: Setting1 => true
      case _           => false
    }
  }
  
  case class Setting2(name: String) extends Setting("bar") {
    override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
      case x: Setting2 => true
      case _           => false
    }
  }
  
  override def equals(other: Any) = other match {
    case s: Settings  => List.forall2(settings, s.settings)(_ == _)
    case x            => false
  }
}

object go
{
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val set1 = new Settings
    val set2 = new Settings
    
    println("set1 == set2? " + (set1 == set2))
    println("isInstanceOf == " + set1.settings.head.isInstanceOf[set2.Setting1])
  }
}
{code}

{code}
$$ scala27 go
set1 == set2? false
isInstanceOf == true
{code}

Good catch! I am going to apply the patch for now. I also agree that isInstanceOf and pattern matching should behave the same way. As to what is the most useful way, I am not sure. Given the trap with Settings, maybe it would be most useful to assume Outer#Inner for any match against Inner, except if an outer instance is given eplicitly.

Pro: This seems to be what one wants most of the time.
Contra: It introduces an irregularity, since normally the identifier `Tpe' means `this.Tpe'.

What do people think?

Thanks

As this patch is now in trunk I am closing this ticket and have created SI-1698 to document the underlying issue.
