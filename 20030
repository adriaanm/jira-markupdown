```scala
class Foo {
  def foo = ":("
}

trait Bar {
  this: Foo =>

  def bar = ":)"
}

object FooBar {
  def fooBar(bar: Bar) {
    println(bar.foo) // error: value foo is not a member of Bar
    println(bar.bar)
  }
}
```

Since only descendants of `Foo` can have `trait Bar` mixed in I think public `Foo` members should be available through reference of type `Bar`
