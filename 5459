(In r24264) Created invisible setting to expose empty package members
outside of the empty package, so the repl can use packages
without going blind to the empty package.  This commit
also eliminates a deadlock which hits when the compiler starts
logging before a lazy val has pulled its head from the noose.
Closes scala/bug#4228, review by odersky.
