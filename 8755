There are similar cases not covered by the mentioned patch:
{code}
scala> new C(42).foo[String].get
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String

scala> new C(42).foo[String].get : Int
res2: Int = 42
{code}
Here, the [String] parameter is ignored, again. This time because the cxTree starts with the type annotation: (new C.<init>(42).foo[String].get: Int)

Is there an easy way to find everything which can possibly get attached to cxTree?
