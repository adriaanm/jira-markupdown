Not able to generate a custom failure message in the parser combinator library. For a rule like ..

```scala
def buy_sell: Parser[BuySell] =
  "to" ~> "buy" ^^^ BUY      |
  "to" ~> "sell" ^^^ SELL     |
  failure("buy or sell expected")
```


If the input has something (say "bought") other than "buy" or "sell", then the message that gets printed is the default one ..

``sell_ expected but identifier bought found

The main parse call is like the following :-

```scala
val str = //.. the string to parse
val tokens = new lexical.Scanner(str)
phrase(order)(tokens) match {
  case Success(order, _) =>
    println(order)
  case Failure(msg, _) => println("Failure: " + msg)
  case Error(msg, _) => println("Error: " + msg)
}
```

I posted this to scala-user and Martin Odersky responded here - [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/24426/focus=24510] and asked to file a ticket.
