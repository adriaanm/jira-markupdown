When I call ant fsc task (with logging=debug) with compilation server stopped it is being got started but after some time the compilation error occurs. I have attached the file being compiled, build.xml and the Ant output.
The fsc return type inversion was a bug (#4519). It got fixed in 2.10.0-M1 ([1a443eb](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/1a443ebb205a2e79951d212567fca0d7bd7dcd7e)), so ant and fsc are back to understanding each other.
