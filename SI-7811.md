I'm working on a very simple scripting engine that can "stream" (in quotes because it seems the compiler wants all the bytes up-front instead of asking for them on-demand during the compilation process) source and compile it.

As of 2.10.2, in scala.reflect.io.AbstractFile line #162, it specifies:

var rest = sizeOption.getOrElse(0)

The default value for sizeOption is None which is perfect since I don't know ahead of time in my stream what the full size is going to be.

Perhaps the buffer size of 0 in this case is intended, but it actually results in confusing behavior. If sizeOption is None, I'd expect it to instead either throw an exception (show an error) or buffer the contents of the stream until read returns -1. Instead it silently compiles nothing.

If the goal is to support an empty .scala file, then sizeOption should return Some(0), correct?

I'm able to easily work around this issue in my code, but thought I'd at least note it.

(on another note -- I wasn't able to modify the priority in the issue to something other than "Blocker")
{{import scala.language.experimental.iKnowWhatImDoing}}

I think I needed that import once when I was using {{VirtualFile}}, around the same code.

I'm not sure the spec has been updated, but the experimental feature import {{iKnowWhatImDoing}} is to the {{scala.language.odersky.L3}} competency level what {{asInstanceOf}} is to the type system.

Easter egg: {{import iKnowWhatImDoing._}} totally disables type checking! /kidding
