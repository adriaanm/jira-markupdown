I don't understand the relevance of separate compilation. I didn't mean go decompiling the bytecode to look at the the method, I meant they are literally the identical method, in the same sense that "Fido the dog" and "Fido the dog" are known to be equal because there is only one Fido the dog. They each have their own synthetic forwarder and each one exists for no reason but delivering Fido the dog.
