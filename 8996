Transplanting my github comment:

"It's pretty sad that there is this protected method "removeElem" which insists on allocating a Some and returning the removed element in it - which is then NEVER USED ANYWHERE. The only uses to which the return value are put are "isDefined" and tossing it aside. Given that object FlatHashTable is private[collection], it's pretty unlikely it does that for the benefit of code which is not in trunk."
