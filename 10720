Notes to myself:

  * the crash is in TestV1Api.scala
  * the crash in patmat is not a bug in patmat, it tries to work with error trees that came from typer
  * in the code, there's a call to {{arbitraryColumn}} method:
   {code}def arbitraryColumn[T: TypeTag: Ordering, U: TypeTag](prefix: String, storage: WriteableRamStore)(implicit execution: ExecutionContext): Gen[Seq[Event[T, U]]]{code}
  as you can see, the type parameters T and U are not bound by anything. The method signature appears to be missing something.
  * strangely enough we infer T = Long, U = Nothing. With no constraints, I'd expect both T and U to be Nothing
  * annotating the call so it comes {{arbitraryColumn[Long, Nothing](...)}} makes the crash disappear
  * separate compilation makes the crash disappear in all circumstances
