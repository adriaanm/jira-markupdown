Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-M4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_33).

scala> def foo: Int = List(0).foldLeft(0){case _ => return 0}
warning: non variable type-argument Int in type pattern scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnControl[Int] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
foo: Int
```

The same code doesn't produce the warning in 2.9 or any earlier 2.10 milestone.

(Something similar may have existed in earlier milestones; see scala/bug#5612 which is mainly a different issue but also includes a similar spurious warning.)
