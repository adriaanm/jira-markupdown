The `scala` REPL doesn't respect ~/.inputrc options, in particular vi editing mode.

Other interpreters, such as `mysql`, `python`, and `irb` all work correctly with this. This makes it inconvenient for vim users to use the interpreter, as it's slow to use the arrow keys and the delete keys to move around and make changes in a character-by-character basis (e.g. can't `cw` to change word).

Here is an example of inputrc settings that should be respected:
```scala
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi
```
