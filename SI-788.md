This code


{code}
object JavaFuture {

  def main(args : Array[String]) {
    
    val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)
    
    val futures = { for(idx <- 1 to 1) yield executor.submit (
      new Callable[Unit] { def call = Thread.sleep(1000) }
    )}//.toList
    
    val startedAt = System.currentTimeMillis
    Thread.sleep(1000) 
    for(f <- futures) f.get
    println("Total(ms): " + (System.currentTimeMillis - startedAt))
    executor.shutdown
  }
}

{code}

executes ~2 sec. If we uncomment '.toList' in 'futures' definition, all works as expected - execution takes ~1 sec.

The same 'cure' works for actors also in this test case:


{code}
object TestFuture {

  def main(args : Array[String]) {
    
    val amount = 5
    val actors = for(i <- 0 until amount) yield actor { loop { react {
      case delay : Int => reply(Thread.sleep(1000)); exit
    } } }

    val startedAt = System.currentTimeMillis
    val futures = { for(idx <- 0 until amount) yield (actors(idx) !! 1000) }.toList
  
    Thread.sleep(5000)
    
    for(f <- futures) f()
    
    println("Total(ms): " + (System.currentTimeMillis - startedAt))
  }
}


{code}

i.e. without 'toList' it takes ~10 sec, with 'toList' - ~5 sec as expected.
I don't think it should be changed.  Perhaps more carefully documented but laziness truly can be a virtue.  In this case its clear that a eagerly generated sequence is what is wanted but in many others you might not need them all generated.

It is easy to go from lazy to strict / eager, but afaik it can't be done the other way around.  A solution, perhaps, is to introduce a "seq" or "sequential" function into predef, something that calls the common cases for toList etc and forces a given sequence to evaluate fully.  

The name would have to be chosen carefully but it would leave a clear indication of what should happen with the code.  In all other cases expect laziness should be the rule.  Calling seq on an eager function / type should be equivalent to a noop
