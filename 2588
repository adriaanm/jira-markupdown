(In r22160) Discovered and disproved this unlikely truth:

  scala> (1 to 1 drop 1) == (1 to 1)
  res0: Boolean = true

It was introduced in r21349 which was to fix SI-2535, but led to SI-3529.
I humbly suggest we can't afford to introduce bugs of this severity
in the pursuit of corner cases such as Ranges which use Int.MaxValue
as a boundary.  And looking at the patch I find the "after" code
a lot harder to follow.  Closes SI-3529.  Review by prokopec.
