The {{UnitParser}} takes unit as argument:

{code}
class UnitParser(val unit: global.CompilationUnit, patches: List[BracePatch]) extends SourceFileParser(unit.source)
{code}

Now, you can ask UnitParser to parse given compilation unit. The parser will be creating tree nodes with positions assigned to them. Those positions will refer to unit passed to UnitParser most of the time.

However, if parser happens to use some methods from {{TreeBuilder}} whose instance is defined in {{Global}} then positions will be created based on {{Global.currentUnit}}. The two units do not have to be equal.

If you use parser outside of regular, batch compilation then you might not have set {{currentUnit}}. That's exactly what happens in {{Eval.scala}} from sbt:
