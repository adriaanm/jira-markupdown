Summary: I think  Map[_,_]#Inner should be equivalent to x3 rather than an error.

```scala
object Test {
  class Map[T1, T2] {
    class Inner
  }
  def f[T1, T2] = { val m = new Map[T1, T2] ; new m.Inner }
  
  // fails - is seen as something like
  // Map[t1, t2] forSome { type t1 ; type t2; } # Inner
  var x1: Map[_,_]#Inner = f[String, Int]
  // error: unbound wildcard type
  //   var x1: Map[_,_]#Inner = null
  
  // syntactically valid, but doesn't do what one probably wants
  var x2: Map[t1 forSome { type t1 }, t2 forSome { type t2 }]#Inner = f[String, Int]
  // error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : Test.Map[String,Int]#Inner
  //  required: Test.Map[t1 forSome { type t1 },t2 forSome { type t2 }]#Inner
  //   var x2: Map[t1 forSome { type t1 }, t2 forSome { type t2 }]#Inner = f[String, Int]
  
  // Winner?
  var x3: Map[t1, t2]#Inner forSome { type t1 ; type t2; } = f[String, Int]
}
```
That would break symmetry. For method param wildcards we interpret
```scala
foo(_).bar 
```
as
```scala
(x => foo(x)).bar
```
Types need to behave the same way, or all sanity is lost ;-)
Replying to [comment:3 odersky]:
> Types need to behave the same way, or all sanity is lost ;-)

I'm happy to take your word for that, but does this mean the shortest way to write this is to be:
```scala
Map[t1, t2]#Inner forSome { type t1 ; type t2; }
```
If Map[_,_]#Inner is a parse error and the alternative is the above, then at the very least we'd better suggest it in the error message.  It is regrettable to impose such a steep syntax penalty: type projections are already unwieldy.
I think if you mix wildcards with type projections you should get what you bargained for ;-) -- I never felt a need to write a type like this. These are enormously hairy types ready to devour you in an instant. The bulkier the notation the better it warns you to not go there, which IMO is a good thing.
