Scala-compiler as an OSGi bundle is important to us to compile Scalate templates inside an OSGi environment. FYI for those looking for good maven accessible OSGi artifacts for 2.9.x, the ServiceMix bundles project wraps them and works well for both scala-compiler and scala-library -- they recently added 2.9.2 as well (untested by me so far, though I'd already built my own 2.9.2 bundles using their 2.9.1 recipe):

https://github.com/apache/servicemix4-bundles/tree/trunk/scala-library-2.9.2

These servicemix artifacts are all available in maven public repos:
