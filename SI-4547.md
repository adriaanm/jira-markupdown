=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? 
Compiler refuses to implicitly convert an Int to a BigDecimal, etc., in the following context:
```scala
  3 + BigDecimal(4)
  3 + BigInt(4)
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Compiler should insert an implicit conversion, translating above to:
```scala
  BigDecimal.int2bigDecimal(3) + BigDecimal(4)
  BigInt.int2bigInt(3) + BigInt(4)
```


=== What do you see instead? ===
Errors like this:
```scala
<console>:6: error: overloaded method value + with alternatives:
  (Double)Double <and>
  (Float)Float <and>
  (Long)Long <and>
  (Int)Int <and>
  (Char)Int <and>
  (Short)Int <and>
  (Byte)Int <and>
  (java.lang.String)java.lang.String
 cannot be applied to (scala.math.BigInt)
       3 + BigInt(4)
       ^
```
```scala
<console>:6: error: overloaded method value + with alternatives:
  (Double)Double <and>
  (Float)Float <and>
  (Long)Long <and>
  (Int)Int <and>
  (Char)Int <and>

  (Byte)Int <and>
  (java.lang.String)java.lang.String
 cannot be applied to (scala.math.BigDecimal)
       3 + BigDecimal(4)
       ^
```
I assume this is an error.  If this is the behavior the spec requires in the presence of preexisting overloaded methods none of whose argument types match the type provided, I would argue that it presents a usability problem.
=== Additional information ===
I couldn't find any other tickets on this issue, but that might be because I was misformulating my search queries.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.6
The spec says: "3. Inaselectione.m(args)witheoftypeT,iftheselectormdenotessomemem- ber(s) of T , but none of these members is applicable to the arguments args. In this case a view v is searched which is applicable to e and whose result con- tains a method m which is applicable to args. The search proceeds as in the case of implicit parameters, where the implicit scope is the one of T . If such a view is found, the selection e.m is converted to v(e).m(args)."

As I read it, that translates to "this is a bug."

I thought it might work with an expected type of BigInt, but it does not.  Furthermore, the error message changes, implying that the expected type influences the set of applicable implicits, but not in a coherent way.
```scala
scala> def g: BigInt = 5 + BigInt(4)
<console>:7: error: overloaded method value + with alternatives:
  (x: Long)Long <and>
  (x: Int)Int <and>
  (x: Char)Int <and>
  (x: Short)Int <and>
  (x: Byte)Int
 cannot be applied to (scala.math.BigInt)
       def g: BigInt = 5 + BigInt(4)
                         ^

scala> def g = 5 + BigInt(4)

  (x: Byte)Int <and>
  (x: String)String
 cannot be applied to (scala.math.BigInt)
       def g = 5 + BigInt(4)
                 ^

(moors in [r25087](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25087)) closes #4547. parts now also looks in HasMethodMatching-style refinedtype's, so that the argument types of the method we're looking for contribute to the implicit scope.
