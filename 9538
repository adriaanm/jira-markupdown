One more: when you specify flags, you should be able to specify conditions under which a test must be skipped because it must fail, e.g., not enough memory for a huge BitSet.  There's no reason to run a test that can't possibly succeed under the test conditions.  I'm open to suggestions for a naming convention for "set up to fail" status.

And why is there updated but no downdated?  Or is that when there is no second date?
