=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Read ScalaDoc. Every value type has a line of documentation reading "Values MAX_FOO and MIN_FOO are defined in object scala.Math."

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
They should point to the appropriate fields in the companion objects.

=== What do you see instead? ===
They point to the deprecated values in scala.Math (which correctly point back to the companion objects)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9 trunk
Looks good now. For example:

Also, the docs for object `scala.Math` show `MAX_...` and `MIN_...` as deprecated:
