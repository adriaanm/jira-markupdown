As expressed by martin in scala/bug#1093:
```scala
the fix can and should be generalized so as to also allow super
calls on trait fields. Should be relatively straightforward given
the technique (rename trait val fields in addition to trait val
setters).
```
I'm closing that one and opening this one so it's not buried in a comment.
