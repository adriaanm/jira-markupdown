Presently, the method `close` in the class `scala.io.Source` is defined without parenthesis. I think this should be modified for two reasons:

1. It is side-effectful.

2. The structural type `{ def close(): Unit }` will then work for both `java.io.Closeable` and `scala.io.Source`. Note that `{ def close: Unit }` doesn't work for `java.io.Closeable`.
