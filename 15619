Scala 2.8.0 final, JDK 1.6.0_20, Ubuntu 10.04

When no compile server is running, {{CompileClient}} executes a new process of {{CompileServer}} and wait 2 seconds before giving up attempts to connect. These 2 seconds are too short to start the server on a slow machine like a netbook. So the first run of fsc always fails on that machine.

I think {{CompileClient}} should wait at least 5 seconds and possibly more for a server.
