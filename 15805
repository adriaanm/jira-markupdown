What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)?
```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> 1+2
res0: Int = 12
```

What is the expected behavior?

According to *Programming in Scala*, this should produce 3, not 12. It looks like + is appending, not adding, although the result still winds up being an Int.

What do you see instead?

12
