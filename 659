From the test case and error message this looks very similar to SI-425. I ran into the same problem while trying a workaround for SI-1434. It is not limited to case class hierarchies. This code with a custom extractor on a parent class also triggers the problem in 2.7.1 and 2.7.2RC3:

{code}
object MatchTest2 {

  trait T extends A
  trait A { def op: String = null }
  object A { def unapply(w: A) = Some(w.op) }

  def f(o: Any): Unit = o match {
    case w: T if(false) => ()
    case A(op) => f(op)
  }
}
{code}
