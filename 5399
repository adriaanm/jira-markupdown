Well, I thought it was clearly wrong based on the fact that 1406/1406 implementation classes in trunk have a name ending in "$$class".  But 2.8.1 does compile it with that name, so maybe it's not wrong.
```scala
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    309 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$$$anonfun$$1$$T$$1.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    442 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$$$anonfun$$1$$T$$class$$1.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    754 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$$$anonfun$$1.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    407 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    435 Feb  6 01:08 t4202.class
```
Drives me nuts trying to infer everything from the implementation.  Is this documented somewhere?
