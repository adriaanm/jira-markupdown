A function  (Double) => Double works also on Int-parameters.
This is not true if you try to compose this function with 
an Int-function. Example

{code}
val d2 = (x:Int) => x+x  // (Int) => Int
val si = math.sin _      // (Double) => Double

val sid2 = (x:Int) => si(d2(x)) // ok, si operates on Int-Parameter

// should be equivalent
val sidx = (x:Int) => (si compose d2) (x)

error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Int) => Int
 required: (?) => Double
       val sidx = (x:Int) => (si compose d2) (x)
                                         ^
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
{code}
// it could go this way 
val int2Double = implicitly[Int<%<Double]

val sidy = si compose int2Double compose d2
                                         
{code}


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 final
  - Java:1.6.0_21
  - Operating system: OpenSuse 10.2

An implicit from B => C is not an implicit from (A => B) to (A => C).  You can derive the latter form the former if you want, but the standard library doesn't do so.

But why is the expression x => si(dd(x))  accepted?

An implicit conversion must be inserted in the middle
to derive the function sidd:(Int)=>(Double)

It seems that the compiler handels  si(dd(x)) in another way
than (si compose dd)(x)

BTW the following implicit hint makes the compiler happy
{code}
implicit def ft2d[T,A]( f:T=>A )(implicit g:A=>Double) = g compose f
val sidy = si compose dd // ok 
{code}

Because it never has to convert a function type.

The expression "(x: Int) => si(x)" types si(x), finds an Int where a Double is needed, and converts it.

The expression "(si compose d2)" types that, finds an Int => Int where a ? => Double is needed, and there is no conversion available.

Yes, absolutely it does.  The function "compose" takes an argument of a function type.  This changes everything.
