Trying to use `max` with `Ordering.fromLessThan` resulted in unexpected bad performance:

```scala
scala> val candidates = Set(1,2,3,4)
candidates: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> def NWORDS(n: Int) = { println("NWORDS "+n); n }
NWORDS: (n: Int)Int

scala> candidates.max(Ordering.fromLessThan[Int](NWORDS(_) < NWORDS(_)))
NWORDS 1
NWORDS 1
NWORDS 1
NWORDS 1
NWORDS 2
NWORDS 1
NWORDS 1
NWORDS 2
NWORDS 3
NWORDS 2
NWORDS 2
NWORDS 3
NWORDS 4
NWORDS 3
NWORDS 3
NWORDS 4
res13: Int = 4
```

Investigating, I found a few places where changes can be made to improve performance. First, on fromLessThan:

```scala
  def fromLessThan[T](cmp: (T, T) => Boolean): Ordering[T] = new Ordering[T] { 
     def compare(x: T, y: T) = if (cmp(x, y)) -1 else if (cmp(y, x)) 1 else 0 
     // We add the following overrides:
     override def lt(x: T, y: T): Boolean = cmp(x, y)
     override def gt(x: T, y: T): Boolean = cmp(y, x)
     override def gteq(x: T, y: T): Boolean = !cmp(x, y)
     override def lteq(x: T, y: T): Boolean = !cmp(y, x)
   } 
```

This prevents comparing twice, as can easily happen using compare.

On max and min:

```scala
   /** Returns the minimal element with respect to the given ordering `cmp` */ 
   def min[B >: A](implicit cmp: Ordering[B]): A = { 
     require(!self.isEmpty, "<empty>.min") 
     var acc = self.head 
     for (x <- self.tail)  // self.tail instead of self
       if (cmp.lt(x, acc)) acc = x 
     acc 
   } 
  
   /** Returns the maximal element with respect to the given ordering `cmp` */ 
   def max[B >: A](implicit cmp: Ordering[B]): A = { 
     require(!self.isEmpty, "<empty>.max") 
     var acc = self.head 
     for (x <- self.tail)  // self.tail instead of self
       if (cmp.gt(x, acc)) acc = x 
     acc 
   } 
```

This avoids comparing the first element with itself. A minor optimization, granted, but can be significant when dealing with small collections -- as the Set and Map optimizations propose to be common.

I also pondering the following, which would take advantage of any optimization on Ordering. However, that seems unlikely, and I do not know if increasing the times assignment happens would have any impact. Still, on max, instead of

```scala
       if (cmp.gt(x, acc)) acc = x 
```

do

```scala
       acc = cmp.max(x, acc)
```

And similarly for min.
