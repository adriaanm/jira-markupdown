Seq defines slice(n) and slice(n,m), but RichString only implements slice(n,m).

This is confusing in the api documentation, as under the Methods inherited from Seq section, the methods aren't disambiguated by their signature.

String.slice(n) would be useful, as str.slice(n, str.length) is awkward for unnamed objects: new String("foo").slice(2), as a nonsensical example.

Scala 2.7.0

scala> var s = new String("test").slice(2,4)
s: scala.runtime.RichString = st

scala> var s = new String("test").slice(2)  
<console>:4: error: wrong number of arguments for method slice: (Int,Int)scala.runtime.RichString
       var s = new String("test").slice(2)
                                  ^

 
we'll deprecate `slice(n: Int)`, since it's equivalent to `drop(n)`
