There are fairly good reasons for wanting to write it.  Writing 
```scala
object Test extends Application {
val o = new { self =>
              override def equals(other : Any) : Boolean =
                 other match {
                   case that : self.type => true
                   ...
                   case _ => false
                 }
      }
}
```
is more uniform than writing
```scala
object Test extends Application {
val o = new { self =>
              override def equals(other : Any) : Boolean =
                 (self eq other) ||
                 (other match {
                   ...
                   case _ => false
                  })
      }
}
```
