[error] NoPosition error while loading Transaction, class file 'lib/jdo2-api-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar(javax/jdo/Transaction.class)' is broken
{code}


The error that a class file "is broken", as unfortunate as this is, will almost always mean you are missing a dependency.  In this case it's javax.transaction.Synchronization.
{code}
scala> new javax.jdo.Transaction
error: error while loading Transaction, class file 'jdo2-api-2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar(javax/jdo/Transaction.class)' is broken
(class javax.transaction.Synchronization not found.)
