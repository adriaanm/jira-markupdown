The question isn't whether they should exist, but what should happen by default when someone uses the obvious name.  A default which silently offers such dangerously different behavior between "def f[T] = typeTag[T]" and "def f[T: TypeTag] = typeTag[T]" is the kind of thing which would literally cause me to find another language.  And I'm a fan.  I hate to think how someone who was already conflicted might react.

If you leave it like this, just don't say later nobody saw it coming.
