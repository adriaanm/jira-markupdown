The old (2.10/2.11) scaladoc used to put type aliases in package objects into "package.html", the new one uses "index.html", thus making it impossible to link correctly to these members when cross-building on 2.11 and 2.12.

See https://travis-ci.org/slick/slick/builds/142174330 for a failure caused by this.

On 2.11, you can link to

```scala
api/slick/dbio/package.html#DBIO[+R]=slick.dbio.DBIOAction[R,slick.dbio.NoStream,slick.dbio.Effect.All]
```

which gets redirected to

```scala
api/index.html#slick.dbio.package@DBIO[+R]=slick.dbio.DBIOAction[R,slick.dbio.NoStream,slick.dbio.Effect.All]
```

On 2.11.0-M5 you need

```scala
api/slick/dbio/index.html#DBIO[+R]=slick.dbio.DBIOAction[R,slick.dbio.NoStream,slick.dbio.Effect.All]
```

There doesn't seem to be a link format that works for both versions.
If I understand your usecase correctly - you're referencing documentation for both 2.11 and 2.12 and you want to be able to use the same links?

In #9873 I explain why the the scheme was changed.

I believe this particular compatibility issue could be solved by producing both an "index.html" and a "package.html" for the package objects.

~~Out of curiosity I'd love to know where in your documentation this is an issue :)~~

EDIT: saw the travis link just now
New scaladoc still generates old URL to external dependencies.

For example: [Binding.scala's API documentation](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/com/thoughtworks/binding/unidoc_2.12/9.0.4/unidoc_2.12-9.0.4-javadoc.jar/!/com/thoughtworks/binding/FutureBinding.html) contains many old style links to Scala standard library, e.g. http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.0/index.html#scala.concurrent.Future . All the links are broken.
