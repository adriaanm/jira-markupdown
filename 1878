We decided against the change, in the end. The problem is that, if we did the change, everytime someone in the future rewrote a library class in Scala, all clients of the class would potentially break, because checking would be stricter for Scala classes than for Java classes. This means nobiody could safely rewrite a public Java class to Scala. That's not something we want.
