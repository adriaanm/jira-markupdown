Seq has unapplySeq method, and the following is possible:

{code}
l match {
  case Seq(1, 2, 3) =>
}
{code}

For symmetry, Seq.apply should also exist, to make the following code possible:

{code}
val l = Seq(1, 2, 3)
{code}

Simplest implementation of Seq.apply is:

{code}
object Seq {
  def apply[A](xs: A*): Seq[A] = xs
}
{code}
