Seq has unapplySeq method, and the following is possible:
```scala
l match {
  case Seq(1, 2, 3) =>
}
```

For symmetry, Seq.apply should also exist, to make the following code possible:
```scala
val l = Seq(1, 2, 3)
```

Simplest implementation of Seq.apply is:
```scala
object Seq {
  def apply[A](xs: A*): Seq[A] = xs
}
```
