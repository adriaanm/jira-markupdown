I've wondered why global isn't an ExecutionContextExecutorService.

Maybe lint or -Xlog-implicits could step in.  Also for name binding gotchas:

And while it's feeling helpful, maybe it could also warn about the collisions in {code}import collection._, concurrent._, util._{code} especially since concurrent.util doesn't show up in the scaladoc.  Or -Yno-import-util.
