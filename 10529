Thanks for reporting! I think this is because of the fix for SI-1786, and it looks related to SI-8198.
The fix for SI-1786 is useful, but it now also infers more precise bounds in expected types (it was mostly intended to have more precise types for "provided things").

I haven't checked, but is it legal in java to assign `skinProperty` to a variable with type `javafx.scene.control.Skin<C extends Skinnable>`,
where `ObjectProperty<Skin<?>> skinProperty()`??
