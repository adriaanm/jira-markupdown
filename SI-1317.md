With either 2.7.2 RC1 or 2.7.1 the following,

{code}
object TIF {
  abstract class A
  case class B(b : String) extends A
  case class C(c : String) extends A

  val l = List(Right(B("b")), Left(C("c")))
  l.map(Either.merge)
}
{code}

results in a compile error,

{code}
foo.scala:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Either[T,T]) => T
 required: (Either[TIF.C,TIF.B] with Product) => ?
  l.map(Either.merge)
               ^
one error found
{code}

Adding the type parameter manually,

{code}
  l.map(Either.merge[A])
{code}

or adding a type ascription,

{code}
  l.map(Either.merge : Either[A, A] => A)
{code}

solves the problem. However it seems that A should be being inferred as the LUB here without explicit type annotations.

Whether or not that's the case, it would be helpful if SLS 6.25.4 were expanded to cover this kind of example in more detail.
Since adriaan's changes enabled me to move merge onto the instance, now this not only works, it infers "Product with A" not merely A.  Good eye, type inferencer!
{code}
object TIF {
  abstract class A
  case class B(b : String) extends A
  case class C(c : String) extends A

  val l = List(Right(B("b")), Left(C("c")))
  val m = l map (_.merge)
}

scala> TIF.m
res2: List[Product with TIF.A] = List(B(b), C(c))
{code}

I'm not altering the status of this ticket since I don't know whether the object behavior is still considered a bug.  Point is there are more options now.
