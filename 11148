Ok, upon further investigation of this issue:

- after adding `SEALED and {{ABSTRACT` flags to enums in `JavaParsers`, and 
- ignoring `checkNoConflict(FINAL, SEALED)` in `Namers` for `isJavaEnum`,

we get to the pattern matcher, which tries to find
- the sealed children of the type in question (MatchAnalysis) using `sealedDescendants`
- `sealedDescendants` uses `children`, but `children` is only populated in `ClassfileParser` ({{addChild}}), but not in `JavaParsers`
