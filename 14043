As part of ticket SI-363, r15440 was committed by Iulian with the following description:

"Static forwarders are added to the companion class of an object when there are no name-conflicts. The class and its companion object should be compiled together (since they are usually in the same file, this shouldn't be a problem)."

This was later reverted due to (unspecified) problems that it caused and the eventual solution was much more restricted since it only helps with the main method case.

This request is about providing a solution similar to the reverted commit. This would make Java code that needs to call into Scala much nicer: for example the common case of calling an apply method in a companion object would look like Foo.apply() instead of the very ugly Foo$$.MODULE$$.apply().
