When attempting to call Java code in a class with multiple parameter types including a forward reference such as
class Foo<A,B<A>>
scalac complains about a broken class.

The error for the attached Scala code which references such a Java class is:

error: error while loading JavaGeneric, class file '.\JavaGeneric.class' is broken
(key not found: T)
Obviously I meant to actually have a forward reference in the above text.
Something like 
class Foo<A<B>,B> { }
