I'm going through the book "Scala by example" downloaded from :
http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf

and discovered on the page 45 a small inconsistency.
Since the method **print** is declared in the *Expr* abstract class, it could be made use of it in the Sum#print method.

{code:language=scala}
abstract class Expr {
  def eval: Int
  def print
}

class Number(n: Int) extends Expr {
  def eval: Int = n
  def print { Console.print(n) }
  }

class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr {
  def eval: Int = e1.eval + e2.eval
  def print {
    Console.print("(")
    print(e1)
    Console.print("+")
    print(e2)
    Console.print(")")
  }
}
```scala

should be changed to this form :

{code: language=scala}
abstract class Expr {
  def eval: Int
  def print
}

class Number(n: Int) extends Expr {
  def eval: Int = n
  def print { Console.print(n) }
  }

class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr {
  def eval: Int = e1.eval + e2.eval
  override def print: Unit = {
    Console.print("(")
    e1.print
    Console.print("+")
    e2.print
    Console.print(")")
  }
}
```
Additional issue found in the book, at page 67, for the *Zipping lists* example :

{code: language=scala}
def zip[B](that: List[B]): List[(a,b)] =
  if (this.isEmpty || that.isEmpty) Nil
  else (this.head, that.head) :: (this.tail zip that.tail)
```scala

should be probably changed to :
{code: language=scala}

def zip[B](that: List[B]): List[(A,B)] =
  if (this.isEmpty || that.isEmpty) Nil
  else (this.head, that.head) :: (this.tail zip that.tail)
```

At page 70 in the book, there is presented an example on how to produce a mapping operation on the elements of a list :
{code: language=scala}
abstract class List[A] { ...
  def map[B](f: A => B): List[B] = this match {
     case Nil => this
     case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs.map(f)
  }
}
```scala

In the case that the current instance(this) is empty it can't be returned because it has the type _List[A]_ , but the method is expected to return _List[B]_

I made a function on my own to implement the example and did it in the following manner :
{code:language=scala}
  def mapList[A,B](f: A => B)(xs:List[A]):List[B] = xs match {
    case Nil => Nil
    case x :: xs1 => f(x) :: mapList(f)(xs1)
  }
```
At page 106 (in the Iterators chapter), I found another possible issue 
{code:language=scala}
    fromArray(xs)
      .zip(from(0))
      .filter ( case (x, i) => x > limit )
      .map ( case (x, i) => i )
```scala

which fails to compile in Scala 2.11 

I found the solution on how to change the code on the following web resource :
http://java.dzone.com/articles/scala-pattern-matching-pair

??dwins: scala requires that “case” statements be inside curly braces. 
The code should look like  this : 

{code:language=scala}
    fromArray(xs)
      .zip(from(0))
      .filter { case (x, i) => x > limit }
      .map { case (x, i) => i }
```
At page 100, chapter 12 *Computing with streams* there is presented the following code block :

{code:language=scala}
range(1000, 10000) filter isPrime at 1
```scala

I didn't find the operation _at_ between the operations of _List_ type and I am wondering if the code block shouldn't actually look like :

{code:language=scala}
range(1000, 10000) filter isPrime apply 1
```
I've found another small issue on the page 114, on the chapter *Implicit parameters and conversions* :

The code sample which in its actual form doesn't successfully compile : 

{code:language=scala}
def sum[A](xs: List[A])(m: Monoid[A]): A =
  if (xs.isEmpty) m.unit
  else m.add(xs.head, sum(m)(xs.tail)
```scala

should actually be 

{code:language=scala}
  def sum[A](xs:List[A])(m:Monoid[A]):A =
    if (xs.isEmpty) m.unit
    else m.add(xs.head, sum(xs.tail)(m))
```
Page 116, chapter *Implicit Parameters and Conversions* , *View Bounds* subchapter 

{code:language=scala}
def sort[A <% Ordered[A]](xs: List[A]): List[A] =
  if (xs.isEmpty || xs.tail.isEmpty) xs
  else {
    val {ys, zs} = xs.splitAt(xs.length / 2)
    merge(ys, zs)
  }
```scala

The construct didn't compile with Scala 2.11 and I've replaced it with :
{code:language=scala}
def sort[A <% Ordered[A]](xs: List[A]): List[A] =
    if (xs.isEmpty || xs.tail.isEmpty) xs
    else {
      val (ys, zs) = xs.splitAt(xs.length / 2)
      merge(ys, zs)
    }
```

Moreover, it seems that the view bounds are deprecated as of Scala 2.11
#7629

The sort sample out of which this example makes part of doesn't compile when using *implicit* keyword. This is due to the fact that the implicit  *int2ordered* function is causing ambiguity for the compiler because it provides the same functionality as the LowPriorityImplicits#intWrapper function.


I've slightly modified the sample code like this :

{code:language=scala}
  type OrderedView[A] = A => Ordered[A]

  def sort[A: OrderedView](xs: List[A]): List[A] =
    if (xs.isEmpty || xs.tail.isEmpty) xs
    else {
      val (ys, zs) = xs.splitAt(xs.length / 2)
      merge(ys, zs)
    }

  def merge[A: OrderedView](xs: List[A], ys: List[A]): List[A] =
    if (xs.isEmpty) ys
    else if (ys.isEmpty) xs
    else if (xs.head < ys.head) xs.head :: merge(xs.tail, ys)
    else ys.head :: merge(xs, ys.tail)

  implicit def num2ordered(x: Num): Ordered[Num] = new Ordered[Num] {
    override def compare(y: Num): Int =
      if (x.value < y.value) -1
      else if (x.value > y.value) 1
      else 0
  }
}

case class Num(value: Int)  {
  override def toString: String = value.toString
}
```scala

Sample code that uses the code above :

{code:language=scala}
def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val xs = List(new Num(1), new Num(4), new Num(2), new Num(6),new Num(3))
    val sortedXs = sort(xs)(num2ordered)
    print(sortedXs.mkString(","))
  }
```
On page 127, Chapter 17 **Abstractions for concurrency** in order to be able to run the code with Scala 2.8+, there should be added a small change
The generic type BoundedBuffer[A] should be BoundedBuffer[A:ClassTag]

{code:language=scala}
class BoundedBuffer[A:ClassTag](N: Int) {
  var in = 0;
  var out = 0;
  var n = 0
  val elems: Array[A] = new Array[A](N)

  def put(x: A) = synchronized {
    while (n >= N) wait()
    elems(in) = x;
    in = (in + 1) % N;
    n += 1
    if (n == 1) notifyAll()
  }

  def get: A = synchronized {
    while (n == 0) wait()
    val x = elems(out);
    out = (out + 1) % N;
    n -= 1
    if (n == N - 1) notifyAll()
    x
  }
}
{code}
