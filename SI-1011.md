Given the following code:

```scala
class Foo(clazz : Class[_])
class Bar extends Foo(classOf[Any])
```

This compiles fine. But if I move them to separate files and compile Foo first then compile Bar against the class rather than the source code I get the following error:

```scala
 error: class Bar needs to be abstract, since type _$$1 in class Foo with bounds >: Nothing <: Any is not defined
class Bar extends Foo(classOf[Any])
```
