It would be very helpful if there was an easier way to scan a package or module for matching symbols. 

A usecase could be a user that wants all values of fields of that has a matching symbol in a module (not a too uncommon scenario I think).

Example usage of this:
{code}
scan("my.package.anobject") { symbol =>
  isSymbolAString(symbol): Boolean
}: Seq[(Any, Symbol)] //Any is the value of the field
{code}

This will return: 
{code} 
Seq(("the acutal value I was looking for", value valueIwasLookingFor))
{code}


If the code looks like this:
{code}
package my.package

object anobject {
  object nestedWorksAsWell { //could be nested as well
    val valueIwasLookingFor = "the acutal value I was looking for"
  }
}
{code}
