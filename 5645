if I have a feeling this is going to get reassigned to scala_community.

for whatever it's worth, sbt has a thing like this, where I can say:
```scala
 log.setTrace(0)  // 0 equals nosbt equals leave out sbt's lines from stack traces
```

looking at whatever sbt is doing there might conceivably help a motivated individual put together a patch.
