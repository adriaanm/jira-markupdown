More specifically, `Global` has a lazy val `macroClassLoader` which is used to load macro implementations. This class loader is neither closed, nor is a reference to it released, as the end of a run.

Here's a sketch of how we could improve the situation:

The diff gets large as I started applying the same idea to the compilation classpath. That is tricker as we need to propagate the `close()` calls all the way down the line to the places to all the places that opened file handles.
