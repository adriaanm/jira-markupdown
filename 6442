I'm not sure why you're fiddling with Arrays if you just want the element type.  You can have it by calling manifest.
{code}
scala> manifest[Map[Int, String]]
res0: Manifest[Map[Int,String]] = scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int, java.lang.String]
{code}
You're not obtaining the element type of Traversable[_] by going through toArray.  Maybe you didn't mean that literally, but if so that's a really confusing choice of notation.  The reflection view of the element type of Traversable[_] will always be Object.  Your examples are all working directly with types you have just specified, and in such cases the manifest is available directly.
