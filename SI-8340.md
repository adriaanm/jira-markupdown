The following is preventing me from turning on fatal warnings, which is something I really want to do:

```scala
$ scala -Ywarn-numeric-widen
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> case class A(b: Short)
<console>:7: warning: implicit numeric widening
       case class A(b: Short)
                  ^
defined class A

scala> 
```
It's to do with the `hashCode`:

```scala
$ scala -Ywarn-numeric-widen
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> case class A(b: Short) { override def hashCode: Int = 0 }
defined class A

scala> 
```

The default `hashCode` doesn't seem to be bad, though:

```scala
override <synthetic> def hashCode(): Int = {
  <synthetic> var acc: Int = -889275714;
  acc = Statics.this.mix(acc, b.toInt);
  Statics.this.finalizeHash(acc, 1)
};
```
Similar bug with multiple parameters and double
scala 2.10.4

```scala
implicit numeric widening
case class A(c: Int, v: Double)
           ^
```
This still happens to me with scala 2.10.6

This generates an implicit numeric warning:
```scala
case class A(a: Char, b: Char)
```

This does not:
```scala
case class A(a: Char, b: Char) {
  override def hashCode: Int = 0
}
```
