The following is preventing me from turning on fatal warnings, which is something I really want to do:

{code}
$ scala -Ywarn-numeric-widen
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> case class A(b: Short)
<console>:7: warning: implicit numeric widening
       case class A(b: Short)
                  ^
defined class A

scala> 
{code}
It's to do with the {{hashCode}}:

{code}
$ scala -Ywarn-numeric-widen
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).

scala> case class A(b: Short) { override def hashCode: Int = 0 }
defined class A

scala> 
{code}

The default {{hashCode}} doesn't seem to be bad, though:

{code}
override <synthetic> def hashCode(): Int = {
  <synthetic> var acc: Int = -889275714;
  acc = Statics.this.mix(acc, b.toInt);
  Statics.this.finalizeHash(acc, 1)
};
{code}
Similar bug with multiple parameters and double
scala 2.10.4

{code}
implicit numeric widening
case class A(c: Int, v: Double)
           ^
{code}
This still happens to me with scala 2.10.6

This generates an implicit numeric warning:
{code:scala}
case class A(a: Char, b: Char)
{code}

This does not:
{code:scala}
case class A(a: Char, b: Char) {
  override def hashCode: Int = 0
}
{code}
