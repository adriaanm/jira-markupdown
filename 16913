The Bash shell scripts in the 2.9.2 tarball do not have a+x permissions:

$ ls -l /opt/local/share/scala-2.9/bin/scala
-rwxr--r-- 1 root admin 4228 Apr 12 20:25 /opt/local/share/scala-2.9/bin/scala

This is annoying when one user installs Scala and another one wants to run Scala, such as in MacPorts' Scala package which I manage [1] where they are owned by root and normal users cannot run them.  Can the script that cuts new Scala releases be updated to fix the permissions on these files?

I tried to assign this to 2.9.2 but it's not listed yet.

Thanks,
Blair
