If I try to compile the following code:
{code}
trait A {
   def f(i: Int): Int
}

object B extends A {
 def f(implicit i: Int) = i
}
{code}

I get error:

{quote}
error: object creation impossible, since method f in trait A of type (i: Int)Int is not defined
{quote}

Same with class:
{quote}
error: class B needs to be abstract, since method f in trait A of type (i: Int)Int is not defined
{quote}
