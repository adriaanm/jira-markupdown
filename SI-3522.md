In Scala 2.7.7 and 2.8.0.RC1 (I didn't test RC2) this line of code worked correctly:

val Array(z, y, x, w @ _*) = Array("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")

In 2.8.0.RC3 and the June 02 nightly I get:

scala> val Array(z, y, x, w @ _*) = Array("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple pattern

Is this a regression or is this an intended change?
This is a duplication of #3480.
