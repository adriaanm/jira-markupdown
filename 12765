Hello,

This is from a committer who has commit rights to the Subversion project
itself and a user of Scala, which is a great language, thank you!

Please add a pre-commit script to reject commits without a log
message, as not having a log message is bad practice and makes
it harder for people to see and determine what work is done.

Example recent revisions with no log message include r12785, r12780,
r12772.

Please add this to your pre-commit, changing SVNLOOK to point at
the svnlook binary on your system.
```scala
# Make sure that the log message contains some text.
SVNLOOK=/usr/local/bin/svnlook
$$SVNLOOK log -t "$$TXN" "$$REPOS" | grep "[a-zA-Z0-9]" > /dev/null || {
  echo "$$0: no log message for txn $$TXN" 1>&2
  exit 1
}
```

It would be good to ask those authors with no commit message to
go back and add one using this command:
```scala
$$ svn propedit --revprop -r N svn:log
```

Regards,
Blair
