A recent build of my project caused the compiler to crash (fsc crashes silently, scalac dumps a stack trace). The top few elements are:

error: scala.MatchError: <unknown tree of class class scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Infer$Inferencer$AccessError> (of class scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Infer$Inferencer$AccessError)
  at scala.reflect.generic.Trees$Traverser.traverse(Trees.scala:454)
  at scala.tools.nsc.ast.Trees$Traverser.traverse(Trees.scala:920)
  at scala.tools.nsc.ast.Trees$TreeTypeSubstituter.traverse(Trees.scala:977)
  at scala.reflect.generic.Trees$Traverser.traverse(Trees.scala:537)

The project has compiled fine up until this error; the changes made when the compiler crashed were mild (a class was added, but yet unused, and possibly an additional static import was made inside of one of the classes.

A file with the full stack trace is attached.

Let me know if I can do anything to help!

EDIT: The issue was caused by importing a private val from another object; I've attached a minimal example that demonstrates the bug.
I have a similar problem (on Mac OS X using Scala 2.9.0 final).

Compiling this simple file:
```scala
package internal {
  private class Y
}

import internal.Y

class X(val y: Y)
```
results in a similar compiler crash.
