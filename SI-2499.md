Create a pure scala project and make some classes in it.

Create another project, this time pure Java and make some classes that depend on the Scala stuff. In the Java project's properties, set up a dependency on the Scala project.

At compile time the Java stuff can refer to the Scala stuff.

But at run time I get class not found problems on Scala Any class when I try to run my Java Application.

Don't think I should have to, but I did add scala nature to that Java project so at least it would get the scala runtime stuff in its classpath.

But then I still got class not found errors on my classes in the Scala project.

This multiple-project setup in my workspace is the whole way we do apps that depend on multiple underlying modules so I can't use scala if I can't get the cross-project thing working completely.
