I am not sure there is a simple fix of the sort that should go in for RC1.  To fix this (without exposing a bunch of other equivalent holes) I had to rewrite a lot of the views library to make it differently-consistent.  The problem is that the function given to `map` is not invertible, so you can't very well change the original values.  But it's also confusing that some methods detach you from the original collection while others do not.

I recommend punting until 2.13, [~moors] [~szeiger] (at which point I may have time to get my tentative fixes in).
