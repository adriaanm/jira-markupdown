collection.mutable.OpenHashMap seems to beat collection.mutable.HashMap in performance. I posted a microbenchmark for just insertion here: https://gist.github.com/1423303. I've also found in informal testing that OpenHashMap is faster. 

OpenHashMap could replace the existing implementation, after doing more extensive profiling to see if/when the existing implementation is faster.
I ran my usual coarse benchmark for such things, compiling the scala distribution.
  
  As-is: 7 minutes 5 seconds
  Replacing HashMap with OpenHashMap: 7 minutes 59 seconds

So this is wontfix in the absence of a significantly more convincing argument.
My whole point in opening this ticket was that more rigorous performance tests be done to determine whether changing the default implementation would make sense. If those tests have already been done, great, just point me to where the results are summarized and I'll shut up. :) If they haven't been done, why was this closed as wontfix?

It looks like Ismael has already done some testing - Ismael - can you explain what the numbers in the table mean in the link you gave? You did not actually explain that anywhere in your message. :) Either OpenHashMap was significantly worse for this benchmark, or significantly better... Besides that randomized search test what other tests did you do and can you summarize your general results?
What is your impression of the arrangement here? Do you often find people lining up to perform tests which only you have expressed an interest in and which you won't perform yourself? I can guarantee you the default implementation will not be changed if it imposes a 10+% slowdown on the compiler (regardless of whether it could be "worked around") and I'm not too sure why I should have to convince you of this.
There is such a status - "NEEDINFO" - but presumably I consider this more of a closed issue than you do.  I did say in my closing comment "in the absence of a better argument", which is what "needinfo" would mean.

Because JIRA is a steaming pile of garbage, I can't assign anything to the submitter without firing up the admin interface and adding them to the list of "scala developers", which isn't going to happen. (The alternative, that tickets can be assigned to everyone, means that I get a dropdown list of 4000 people every time I want to assign a ticket.  There is apparently no middle ground.)
It is as simple as that, plus (in this case of OpenHashMap) a variety of tweaks elsewhere based on where it doesn't compile anymore due to using HashMap-specific things.  Then it's "ant all.clean locker.done" to get the code in position and "time ant build" to get a time.
