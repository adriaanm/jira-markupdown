The following fails to compile in Scala 2.7.7:

```scala
class Key[T]

class Entry[T](val k: Key[T], val v: T)

object Entry {
   def makeDefault[T <: AnyRef] = new Entry[T](new Key[T], null: T)
}
```

Simplified failure case:

```scala
def m[T <: AnyRef] = null: T
```

Output:
```
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Null(null)
 required: T
       def m[T <: AnyRef]: T = null: T
                               ^
```
I don't remember what I was trying to do back when I reported this, but the implemented behavior seems more like a feature than a bug. 

If the programmer really wants to pass a null (ugh), he can either change the type bound to `T >: Null` or change the ascription to a cast: {code}null.asInstanceOf[T]{code}
