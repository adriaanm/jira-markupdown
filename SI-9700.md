When a private case class and explicit companion object are nested within a parent class, attempting to access vals within the companion object results in a Stack Overflow.  If the access modifier is public (or even package private), all is well.  This worked in 2.11.7 (at least in the specific form specified here).  As a variant on this issue, when run in the 2.11.8 REPL, it manifests as an Illegal Monitor Exception.

The following minimized code example illustrates:
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_66).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> class A {
     |   private case class B(x: Int)
     |   private object B {
     |     val z = B(0)
     | }
     |   val a = B.z.x
     | }
defined class A

scala> new A
java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException
  at A.$line3$$read$A$$B$lzycompute(<console>:13)
  at A.$line3$$read$A$$B(<console>:13)
  ... 1022 elided

with private access modifier removed
scala> class A {
     |    case class B(x: Int)
     |    object B {
     |     val z = B(0)
     | }
     |   val a = B.z.x
     | }
defined class A

scala> new A
