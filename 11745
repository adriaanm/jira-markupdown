```
Extractor patterns within a pattern match typically disable analysis of exhaustivity and reachability.
```
Oh, I knew that this happened with guard but not with extractors. I think that two things need to be done at least:
- Have a warning (even an optional one) when the exhaustivity/reachability analysis is disabled.
- Try to do "best effort" analysis, e.g. in your example, replace `case Some(1) if "".isEmpty` by `case Some(1)` to do a partial analysis, or in my example replace `case Node1(Foo(1))` by `case Node1(_)`, this would already improve things a lot.

The warning is especially important because a type system is much more useful when it is reliable, it's hard to rely on the exhaustiveness checker because it's so easy to accidentally disable it.
