This is because the xml package object now defines an alias for IOException.
I think this is a bad idea, precisely because you can get these ambiguities.
That's why I'd remove:
```scala
  type IOException                  = java.io.IOException
  type UnsupportedEncodingException = java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException
  
  type URL                    = java.net.URL
  type MalformedURLException  = java.net.MalformedURLException
```
These are generally known classes, so the value of aliasing them is small, and the potential downside is large.

This is a release blocking bug, so I gave it high priority.
