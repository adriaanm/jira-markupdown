Further info: the typer has a second try at finding implicits, and uses duplicated trees. It looks like the duplicator focuses positions, and [~burmako] might know more about it. In 75b44a6 a new `duplicateAndKeepPositions` method is added, but the typer doesn't use it in this case. Could that be it?
