Something similar was discussed here:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala/17686

where it was (mostly) agreed that it would add clarity to be able to do something like this:

{{v ifDefined foo otherwise bar }}

where v is an Option. I suggested 'ifDefined' because of its symmetry with 'isDefined'.
