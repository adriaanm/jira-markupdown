I didn't, actually, so that's good to know. However, I don't think this *caused* the bug, it simply lifted the rock under which it was hiding. It's got something to do with scoping and symbols being entered with the right type params, but then all of a sudden the next lookup of that symbol doesn't see the type params yet. I've been trying to debug it, but haven't found a good strategy yet...
