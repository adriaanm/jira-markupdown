this is a less severe form of SI-6049. SI-6049 was closed because the back end no longer crashes, but there are still spurious warnings.

so e.g. borrowing Miguel's minimized code from SI-6049:

{noformat}
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-M6 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_33).

scala> :paste
object O {
  while(true) {
    var j = 0
    try j
    catch { case t: Throwable => }
  }
}
// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:11: warning: Visited SCOPE_EXIT before visiting corresponding SCOPE_ENTER. SI-6049
           try j
           ^
defined module O
{noformat}

at SI-6049 Miguel said this warning could also be a sign of issues with "whether the debugger shows the variable in question"
warning still present in 2.10.0-M7. the warning references SI-6049, should probably reference this ticket instead
FYI, I'm getting this warning with the following code:

{code}
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService
import java.util.Queue

class Spinner[-T](f: T => Unit, execService: ExecutorService, queue: Queue[T]) {
  @volatile private[this] var runFlag = true

  def start() {
    execService.execute(new Runnable() {
      def run() {
        while (runFlag) {
          val item = queue.poll()
          if (item != null) {
            try {
              f(item)
            }
            catch {
              case t: Throwable => t.printStackTrace()
            }
          }
        }
      }
    })
  }

}
{code}

Running scalac [Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_29)] gives the following:

{code}
test.scala:12: warning: Visited SCOPE_EXIT before visiting corresponding SCOPE_ENTER. SI-6049
          if (item != null) {
          ^
one warning found
{code}
I also just noticed GenASM report this on itself.  Just a bit of irony.

...jvm/GenASM.scala:133: warning: Visited SCOPE_EXIT before visiting...

I agree that the warning is a distraction. Shouldn't it sit behind -Xdev?

OK, then you don't need mine. I see the semantics of devWarning is Xdev || Ydebug.

That might be more useful, on the theory that if a dev sees the SCOPE_EXIT enough to be annoyed, they might be motivated to remedy it.
