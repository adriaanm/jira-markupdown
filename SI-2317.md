Problem exists in trunk, but not in 2.7.4. The basic idea is that if I have a library A that doesn't use -optimise, and then I build a library B that extends a trait in library A with class C, and library B *does* use optimize, then the generated code is wrong and fails at runtime. 

If they're all compiled together, it doesn't seem to be a problem.

Steps:
{code}
  mkdir classes
  scalac -d classes Tensor.scala
  scalac -optimise -d classes DoubleCounter.scala
  scala -cp classes/

There's a good chance this example could be made more minimal, but I'm not sure.

(Also, can we please have an -optimize alias for -optimise. Ignorant Americans and such :-)
