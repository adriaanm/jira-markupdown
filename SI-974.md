The following code fails under 2.7.1 (using the new Eclipse plugin integrated compiler):

```scala
  case class CovariantClass[+T](wrap: Class[_ >: T])
```

The following errors result:

```scala
covariant type T occurs in contravariant position in type [+T](Conversions.this.CovariantClass[T])Some[java.lang.Class[_$$1]] forSome { type _$$1 >: T } of method unapply
```

and

```scala
covariant type T occurs in contravariant position in type => Class[_$$1] forSome { type _$$1 >: T } of value wrap
```

When testing in 2.7.0, the code successfully compiles:

```scala
scala> case class CovariantClass[+T](wrap: Class[_ >: T])
defined class CovariantClass

scala>
```

The constraints are theoretically sound, so I would certainly expect Scala to handle this properly.  Incidentally, if I flip the constraint to a lower-bound, it compiles just fine under both 2.7.0 and 2.7.1.
