Notes to self/other potential contributors:

- I've always wanted something to tell me more of what the mystical `:power` mode is about, when I might want to use it. I guess I'm not a power user!
- [These 2.11 release notes](http://docs.scala-lang.org/scala/2.11/) would be a good source for fleshing out the overview more. A wealth of useful stuff there with a good start on docs for it already.
- The REPL has no config file but you can manually `scala -i` or use an alias or wrapper script to have your own library of utility functions, common imports, etc. The file can include REPL commands like `:load` and `:paste`.
- I'd like to know where to find properties that might be useful, e.g. `scala -Dscala.color`.
