.. and some further poking indicates, as you might have expected, that that `NoType` was not put in there by the cycle detection logic in the `apply` method

proposed patch:

{code}
     /** The type at i'th position in this sequence; lazy types are returned evaluated. */
     def apply(i: Int): Type = elems(i) match {
-      case NoType =>
+      case NoType if pending.keySet contains i => // the NoType was put there by us since it's in pending's keys -- SI-3676 says it might come from outer space as well
{code}
