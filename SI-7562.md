When two or more matches overlap, Regex.findAllIn does not report each individual match. A simple test case is

{code}
// should evaluate to 2, but evaluates to 1
"aa".r.findAllIn("aaa").toSeq.size
{code}

There are certainly use cases where it is not helpful to find overlapping matches (e.g., when replacing text), but this is not universal. Perhaps there should be a variant method?

I guess the underlying implementation is using Matcher.find(), which resumes the search from the last unmatched character. It could instead use Matcher.find(start) and resume from the second character of the previous match.
Lookahead doesn't consume input, but you can capture it explicitly just the same:
{code}
scala> for (m <- """(a)(?=(a))""".r.findAllMatchIn("aaa")) yield (m group 1) + (m group 2)
res8: Iterator[String] = non-empty iterator

scala> .toList
res9: List[String] = List(aa, aa)
{code}

I kind of wish I could hop on sbaz and discover regex-related implicits in a repository. It could echo a line to paste into build.sbt and an import for my source, and then stick the code in my ivy cache.

{code}
scala> implicit class AllIn(val s: String) extends AnyVal {
     | def allIn(t: String): List[String] = (
     | for (m <- s"(${s.head})(?=(${s.tail}))".r.findAllMatchIn(t))
     |   yield (m group 1) + (m group 2)
     | ).toList
     | }
defined class AllIn

scala> "ab+a" allIn "aaababbbaaa"
res18: List[String] = List(aba, abbba)

scala> "ab+a*" allIn "aaabaaabbbaaa"
res19: List[String] = List(abaaa, abbbaaa)

scala> :javap
:javap not yet working with java 1.7
{code}

That's why I wind up never trying stuff out on 2.10.
