If I have a CLASSPATH with:

CLASSPATH=foo.jar

where foo.jar is a symlink to foo.jar.0, it will be able to recognize classes from that JAR file. But if instead I directly reference the jar.0 file:

CLASSPATH=foo.jar.0

it will not work. I suspect that Scala's CLASSLOADER assumes a JAR file always ends with "*.jar". There is an obvious & easy workaround for this, but it would be good to fix this limitation. Thanks.
Sorry, should have taken more care with the ticket. I saw this behavior with:

* Linux
* JDK 1.6.0_14
* scala 2.7.7
* scala interpreter mode

The exact condition was I was running scala with a CLASSPATH generated by Ivy (which had resolved the symlinks to the raw filenames, causing the problem), and I saw this behavior whether I passed it in with the shell variable or -classpath option.

Based on above it sounds like bug already fixed at least as I saw it (in interpreter) fixed in 2.8 -- I searched fixed tickets but hadn't seen, maybe missed or fixed as a side effect of some other change?
(In r22478) Routed all places in trunk which look for jar files through the
same function, and then changed the default behavior to recognize
jars even if they don't have a *.jar extension by squinting at the
first few bytes of the file.
