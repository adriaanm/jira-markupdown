The behavior of this code

{code}
scala> class A(implicit a: Int);
defined class A

scala> class B()(implicit a: Int);
defined class B

scala> new A()(1)
res1: A = A@159d450

scala> new B()(1)
res2: B = B@171f735

scala> new A(1)
<console>:7: error: too many arguments for constructor A: ()(implicit a: Int)A
       new A(1)
{code}

as asked on [SO|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3206149/why-cant-the-first-parameter-list-of-a-class-be-implicit] seems not to be explained in the spec.

I couldn't find it either in {{5.1.1 Constructor Invocations}} nor in {{7.2 Implicit Parameters}}.
The current language in [5.3|http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/05-classes-and-objects.html#class-definitions]

{quote}If a class has no formal parameter section that is not implicit, an empty parameter section () is assumed.{quote}

was refined under SI-10097.

The special treatment is at the definition and not at the instance creation.
