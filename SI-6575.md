(From at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-user/2pcH-ck46Qg/discussion)

with Scala 2.10.0-RC1 I found an issue with stackable traits that 
doesn't come up with Scala 2.9.2. Based on trait X 

{code}
trait X { def foo: PartialFunction[Int, Int] } 
{code}

and two stackable traits Y and Z (that extend X): 

{code}
trait Y extends X { abstract override def foo = { case i => super.foo(i) * 2 } } 
trait Z extends X { abstract override def foo = { case i => super.foo(i) + 3 } }
{code} 

I have another stackable trait Comb that combines what Y and Z are doing 
(and that does some additional work): 

{code}
trait Comb extends Y with Z { abstract override def foo: 
PartialFunction[Int, Int] = { case i => super.foo(i) - 2 } } 
{code}

This compiles with Scala 2.9.2 without problems but with Scala 
2.10.0-RC1 I'm getting the following error: 

{code}
[error] ...: missing parameter type for expanded function 
[error] The argument types of an anonymous function must be fully known. 
(SLS 8.5) 
[error] Expected type was: 
scala.runtime.AbstractPartialFunction[Int,Int] with Serializable 
[error]   trait Comb extends Y with Z { abstract override def foo = { 
case i => super.foo(i) - 2 } } 
[error] ^ 
[error] one error found 
{code}

Of course I can get around this issue by writing the foo method type 
explicitly 

{code}
trait Y extends X { abstract override def foo: PartialFunction[Int, Int] 
= { case i => super.foo(i) * 2 } } 
trait Z extends X { abstract override def foo: PartialFunction[Int, Int] 
= { case i => super.foo(i) + 3 } } 
trait Comb extends Y with Z { abstract override def foo: 
PartialFunction[Int, Int] = { case i => super.foo(i) - 2 } } 
{code}

but then any concrete class that should be modified with Comb must add 
the foo method type as well i.e. 

{code}
class Temp extends X { def foo: PartialFunction[Int, Int] = { case i => 
i } } 
val tmp = new Temp with Comb 
// ... 
{code}

which wasn't necessary with Scala 2.9.2 either. If the type is omitted i.e. 

{code}
class Temp extends X { def foo = { case i => i } } 
val tmp = new Temp with Comb 
// ... 
{code}

I'm getting 

{code}
[error] ...: overriding method foo in class Temp of type => 
scala.runtime.AbstractPartialFunction[Int,Int] with Serializable; 
[error]  method foo in trait Comb of type => PartialFunction[Int,Int] 
has incompatible type 
[error]   val tmp2 = new Temp with Comb 
[error]                  ^ 
[error] one error found 
{code}
