I have a similar problem:

Using the Oracle Berkeley DB for Java, I get:

"annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: ONE_TO_ONE{<null>}"

when using this annotation:

@SecondaryKey(relate = ONE_TO_ONE)

where "ONE_TO_ONE" was imported as:
import com.sleepycat.persist.model.Relationship.ONE_TO_ONE

Interestingly, this problem shows up **only** in the Eclipse plugin manifesting as the error icon against the line in the editor, but **not** under the problems views.  It also does not generate an error from a command-line scalac compilation.

This is using the 2.8 nightly from 20091021.
