Compiling and running the attached source produces the output:
A
A
A
B

whilst all four expressions should be identical.

It appears that different types are being inferred for T in selectDynamic[T] depending on whether it is called explicitly, and whether the expression is then assigned.

There probably exist simpler test cases which don't involve implicits, though this one clearly demonstrates the issue.
