There is no error in the attached code, as far as I can see. (It does not require type inference either, though.)

In fact,  the last line

{code}
toResultMatcher[String, Iterable](new Result[Iterable[String]]).size(0) // this fails to show a type error in eclipse
{code}

gets adapted to 
{code}
stringWrapper(toResultMatcher[String, Iterable](new Result[Iterable[String]]()).size).apply(0)
{code}

which is type correct by the implicit conversion `stringWrapper`, and the fact that String has a method `apply`
