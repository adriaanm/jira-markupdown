Hello,

I found that signature of return type of Array.companion is invalid:
()Lscala/collection/generic/Companion<[>;

("[" should be followed by type def)

I discovered this problem while trying to fix a problem in Eclipse plug-in.

Version of compiler that I used to compile Scala library is r18651.
Confirmed, javap shows:
```scala
const SI-201 = Asciz      ()Lscala/collection/generic/Companion<[>;;
```
Also see #2345.

To answer grek's question:
`javap -classpath build/quick/classes/library -verbose scala.Array` (see `man javap` for more details).
Copied from #2345:
It's cause by the definition of "class Array" in Array.scala:
```scala
final class Array[A](_length: Int) extends Vector[A] 
                                      with TraversableClass[A, Array]
                                      with VectorTemplate[A, Array[A]] {
```
Where "TraversableClass?[A, Array]" should be "TraversableClass?[A, Array[A]]" or other.

And at line 401:
```scala
  override def companion: Companion[Array] = throw new Error()
```
The Array also lacks type paramter.

I don't know why the compiler cannot detect the lack of Array's type parameter here.

BTW, scala.Array seems can not be automatically casted to plain "java.lang.Object" for Java's call as:
```scala
java.text.Format#format(Object obj)
```
I'm not sure if it's also related to this issue.
