There is no easy way to check if a string matches a whole regex.

= enhancement recommendation =

Add a method to scala.util.matching.Regex like this:

def matches(s: String): Boolean = {
   pattern.matcher(s).matches
}

That works, but is not exactly the same thing.

When matching a large set of string against a single regex, the method I propose ought to be more efficient since it will reuse a compiled regex:

[http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#matches(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.CharSequence)]

_If a pattern is to be used multiple times, compiling it once and reusing it will be more efficient than invoking this method each time._ 
To avoid recompiling a regex, create it exactly once.

{code}
scala> val r = "(abc)+".r
r: scala.util.matching.Regex = (abc)+

scala> import PartialFunction._
import PartialFunction._

scala> implicit class `regex matches`(val r: util.matching.Regex) {
     | def matches(s: String): Boolean = cond(s) { case r(_*) => true }
     | }
defined class regex$u0020matches

scala> r matches "abcabc"
res0: Boolean = true

scala> r matches "abcabcd"
res1: Boolean = false
{code}

Maybe the verb or predicate should read {{r isMatchedBy "abc"}}.

If the SIP for boolean match goes through, the syntax could become {{"abc" match r(_*)}}.

This comment is to answer another SO question.  It would be nice if SO questions or their ilk could be upgraded to issues without leaving the conversational domain (ML, SO, JIRA).
