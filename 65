Fixed for next beta (B5). Note that you are still going to encounter stack overflows when the list gets to a hundred or so elements (depending on what your stack limit is). This is an intrinsic limitation in NSC, which can't handle large constants lists very well because of type inference. Would personally avoid large consts lists if possible, and use a list buffer instead.
