The following code shouldn't compile:
```scala
object Test {
    case class Y[T1, T2 <: T1]
    // val test = Y[Nothing, Int]  // Compiler error
    case class Test[T]
    val test2 = Test[Y[Nothing, Int]]  // No error
}
```
Even simpler example of unsound type check:
```scala
trait T[A <: Int]
new Array[T[Float]](1)
```
Wow! Jesper pointed me to this ticket a while ago, but only just got around to checking it out.
This is pretty bad. Luckily, it turned out to be an easy fix:

`doTypeTraversal` in `RefChecks` used `apply` instead of `mapOver`, which caused `checkBounds` to only be called for the type arguments at the leaves of the tree, instead of traversing the whole tree... This bug masked a couple type errors in the new collection library:

```scala
trait SequenceView[+A, +Coll <: Sequence[_]] extends SequenceViewTemplate[A, Coll, SequenceView[A, Coll]] 

object SequenceView {
  type Coll = TraversableView[_, _]
```

is wrong!

the type alias should be:

```scala
  type Coll = TraversableView[_, C] forSome {type C <: Traversable[_]}
```
I knew I shouldn't have said it was an easy fix :-)

pos/contrib701 illustrates that there's more to be done:
```scala
trait B {
  type A[T] >: A[A[T]]
}
```

this makes the compiler loop now... I guess that's a separate bug, though
opened #2246 to deal with the looping problem (solved in my working copy -- running test suite now)
