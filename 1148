The fsc server binds to all interfaces because it is actually possible to start the compilation server on one machine and run the compilation on a different one, as long as they have a file system in common. Security is handled by means of a password exchange.

Regarding the connection to localhost, the local address is currently obtained via java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost(); a further unnecessary call to getHostName() has been removed.

According to the documentation in:

{{http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#getLocalHost()}}

the call will attempt to resolve the local host name, and fall back to the standard loopback address if that is not possible. Referring to the same documentation, the exception that you obtain might indicate signify that no interface (including loopback) can be found.

Either way, we do in fact use getLocalHost() to initiate a connection with fsc in the default case.
