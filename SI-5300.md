Affected Scala Version: 2.10.0.rdev-4005-2011-12-13-g278a225 (current master)

orElse called on a simple partial function like:

{code} 
val pf: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = { case _ => }
pf orElse pf
{code}

throws a NPE:

{code}
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at scala.runtime.AbstractPartialFunction.orElse(AbstractPartialFunction.scala:41)
...
{code}
I also stumbled upon this issue. Some details in a [scala-users post|https://groups.google.com/group/scala-user/browse_thread/thread/70b8b654a238d721]. Tried to replicate the problem in a reduced case without success.
