Sorry to be a pest about this... but we've been bitten a number of times by this issue.  

I scanned through the spec for mention of this form of assignment, but could not find anything.  A pointer would be appreciated.

If I rewrite the code to:
{code}
val (tis, not: Option[String]) = ("a", "b") match {
  case ("b", _) => (Some("Dog"), None)
  case _ => (Some((1,2)), Some("Dog"))
}

val is: Option[String] = tis
{code}

The compiler picks up the error.

Thanks!
