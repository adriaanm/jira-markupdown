When removing the @deprecated annotation from a type and saving the file the deprecation warning messages on the users of the type do not get removed from the Problems View. To remove the deprecation messages we have to do a Clean&Build.

This does not hold for deprecated methods (def, etc), only types (classes, traits, object).

This might be a build manager and not an Eclipse bug.
This is an old bug that I tracked but didn't open an issue for since I thought that it might be yet another instance of SI-2443. This is because it applies to top level types and not methods. Recently SI-2443 got fixed (and as a result SI-2581 and SI-1584 also got fixed) so I tested this bug again and opened this issue since it is still valid.
Duplicate of SI-2652.
