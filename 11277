Interesting. I guess the g(Object...) case is really sign for a compiler bug. I wonder how type inference with generic methods plays into this kind of interoperability, i.e. when the signature is something like:
```scala
  public <T> void h(T... o) {
    System.out.println("t...");
  }
```

On a bytecode level, T... is really erased again to Object[], but on a language level, there is a lot of (false) type-safety and type-inference that is applied. I'm saying false, because any list of parameters will be viable, in principle.

This becomes particularly interesting when the T type has side-effects on the call site, such as:
```scala
  public <T> T h(T... o) {
    System.out.println("t...");
    return o != null && o.length > 0 ? o[0] : null;
  }
```

I wonder if this would produce the same behaviour in Scala as in Java, e.g. (pseudo-repl):
```scala
scala> 1 == t.h(1)
true
```
