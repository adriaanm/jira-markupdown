(In r22446) Enumeration fixes.  There was no way to do reflection-based naming
correctly simply by inspecting method signatures (because a Value from
a different Enumeration stored in a val looks identical to one from
this Enumeration) so I have Value store the outer Enum for comparison
purposes.  This won't make anything new uncollectable because they
already have an $$outer pointing there.  This also simplified the
reflection logic: it's an eq test rather than a series of heuristics.

Closes SI-3616, SI-3615.  Review by phaller.
