Current definition (in Section 4.4 and Syntax Summary) is:

{code}
  TypeParam ::= id [‘>:’ Type] [‘<:’ Type] [‘<%’ Type]
{code}

Which does not reflect the addition of type constructor polymorphism. Should instead (I think) be:

{code}
  TypeParam ::= id [TypeParamClause] [‘>:’ Type] [‘<:’ Type] [‘<%’ Type]
{code}


Also does not allow '_', so perhaps this should actually be:

{code}
  TypeParam ::= id [TypeParamClause] [‘>:’ Type] [‘<:’ Type] [‘<%’ Type]
              | ‘_’
{code}

changed to
{code}
TypeParam        ::= (id | `_') [TypeParamClause] [`>:' Type] [`<:' Type] [`<%' Type]
{code}
