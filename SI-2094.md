The following code does not compile, even though it should. Scala compiler versions 2.7.5.final and 2.8.0.r18093-b20090624020115 both produce the same error message (see below).

```scala
object Test extends Application {

  // compiles:
  Map[Int, Value](
    0 -> KnownType(classOf[Object]),
    1 -> UnknownValue())

  // does not compile:
  Map(
    0 -> KnownType(classOf[Object]),
    1 -> UnknownValue())

  // Experiment.scala:10: error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : (Int, KnownType)
  //  required: (Int, Product with Value{def getType: Option[java.lang.Class[_$$2]]}) where type _$$2
  //     0 -> KnownType(classOf[Object]),
  //       ^
  // one error found
}
sealed trait Value {
  def getType: Option[Class[_]]
}
case class UnknownValue() extends Value {
  def getType = None
  // compiles if changed to:
  // def getType: Option[Class[_]] = None
}
case class KnownType(typ: Class[_]) extends Value {
  def getType = Some(typ)
}
```
(extempore in [r25149](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25149)) Added sanity check to lub calculation to prevent invalid lubs from
emerging. The underlying cause of said lubs is that higher-order
type parameters are not handled correctly: this is why the issue
is seen so frequently in the collections. See pending test
pending/pos/those-kinds-are-high.scala for a demonstration. Until that's
fixed, we can at least raise the bar a bit.

Closes #2094, #2322, #4501. Also, some test cases in neg have been
promoted into working programs: #2179, #3774. (They're not in neg for
the "shouldn't work" reason, but out of despair.)

In some cases, such as the original reported ticket in #3528, this
only pushes the problem downfield: it still fails due to inferred type
parameters not conforming to bounds. I believe a similar issue with
higher-order type parameters underlies that.

Look at how far this takes us though.  All kinds of stuff which
did not work, now works.  None of these even compiled until now:

  scala> :type List(mutable.Map(1 -> 1), immutable.Map(1 -> 1))
  List[scala.collection.Map[Int,Int]]

  scala> :type Set(List(1), mutable.Map(1 -> 1))
  scala.collection.Set[Iterable[Any] with PartialFunction[Int,Int]]

  scala> :type Stream(List(1), Set(1), 1 to 5)
  Stream[Iterable[Int] with Int => AnyVal{def getClass(): Class[_ >: Int with Boolean <: AnyVal]}]

  scala> :type Map(1 -> (1 to 10), 2 -> (1 to 10).toList)
  scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Int]]

PERFORMANCE: compiling quick.lib and quick.comp, this patch results in
an extra 27 subtype tests. Total. Time difference too small to measure.
However to be on the safe side I made it really easy to disable.

  private final val verifyLubs = true // set to false
