I was told on the mailing list this is a bug so I'll just copy and paste from there (see below). I was using Scala 2.8.0 Final.

---

I was hoping to retrieve the manifest of an array's element type like so:
```scala
scala> manifest[Array[Double]].typeArguments
```
This returns an empty list. Looking at the Manifest.arrayManifest method, I see that it is implemented as
```scala
override def arrayManifest: Manifest[Array[T]] =
    Manifest.classType[Array[T]](arrayClass[T](erasure))
```
This explains why the above retuns Nil but it looks like implementing it as
```scala
  override def arrayManifest: Manifest[Array[T]] =
    Manifest.classType[Array[T]](arrayClass[T](erasure), this)
```
would solve the problem.
