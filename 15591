I was told on the mailing list this is a bug so I'll just copy and paste from there (see below). I was using Scala 2.8.0 Final.

---

I was hoping to retrieve the manifest of an array's element type like so:

{code}
scala> manifest[Array[Double]].typeArguments
{code}
This returns an empty list. Looking at the Manifest.arrayManifest method, I see that it is implemented as
{code}
override def arrayManifest: Manifest[Array[T]] =
    Manifest.classType[Array[T]](arrayClass[T](erasure))
{code}
This explains why the above retuns Nil but it looks like implementing it as
{code}
  override def arrayManifest: Manifest[Array[T]] =
    Manifest.classType[Array[T]](arrayClass[T](erasure), this)
{code}
would solve the problem.
