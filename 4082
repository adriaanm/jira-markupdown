I guess I misunderstood the comment "this works". I thought the ticket was moved to low priority because the `Console.withIn` thing was being proffered as a workaround (but it's not). Sorry for the confusion.

Anyway, here's a workaround (using jline which appears to be included by scala already):
{code}
scala> new jline.ConsoleReader().readLine('*')
******
res0: java.lang.String = abdefg
{code}
