Consider the following code:

{code}
(1 to 10).toList.maxBy(xâ‡’{
  Thread.sleep(1000) // heavy computation here
  println("Evaluate the ordering of " + x)
  x
})
{code}

This code will evaluate measure function 18 times instead of 10 times.
It will cause performance penalty if the function is heavy.


In fact, consider {code}(1 to 10).maxBy{i => -i}{code} Here the function will be executed -10- 9 times for i=1 (the max).

Edit: To clarify, I agree with you. I'm pointing out that the closure is executed with *i=1* nine times in this example. It is not necessarily the case that all values of i are executed twice. This would be of interest for closures that have side-effects.
I see your point. You're correct. Let me edit the description.
