I think this issue has some life in it yet, so let me note for the record:

This example went from working to not working in r23244, which it was stated was to fix scala/bug#3281 and scala/bug#3866.  This may help to illuminate why propagating accumulated constraints too far can be as much of a problem as not far enough.
