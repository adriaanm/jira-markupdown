Implicit case classes are broken, because the type of the class and the type of the object are being mixed up:

{code}

scala> implicit case class IntOps( i: Int ) {
     |    def twice = i * 2
     | }
defined class IntOps

scala> 11 : IntOps
<console>:10: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method IntOps of type (i: Int)IntOps
and  object IntOps of type IntOps.type
match argument types (Int) and expected result type IntOps
              11 : IntOps
              ^
{code}
This is far more insidious.   Objects are completely ignored when determining duplicates in the namespace:

{code}

object test {

  def x(i: Int) = i
  object x { def apply(i: Int) = i }
}

scala> test.x(1)
<console>:8: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both object x in object test of type test.x.type
and  method x in object test of type (i: Int)Int
match argument types (Int)
              test.x(1)
                   ^


{code}


I think this is related:

{code}
implicit case class Foo(val foo: Int)
Foo(1)
{code}

This fails:

{code}
<console>:10: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method Foo of type (foo: Int)Foo
and  object Foo of type Foo.type
match argument types (Int)
              Foo(1)
              ^
{code}

This is because the implicit class is desugared to an implicit method with the same name as the class, which makes the code ambiguous from the compiler POV.
In my opinion it would make sense to desugar the implicit class to a different method name, like {{FooImplicit}}.
I understand that the release shouldn't be delayed over this bug, but I really hope this situation can be addressed with a fix as soon as possible. Loosing case is a pretty hefty price to pay, especially when intending to use it combined with value classes.

On the ML (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/8TrS3ar5LcY/Qg7JEqN7onwJ), this alternative desugaring was mentioned, but I can't find any discussion of its disadvantages ("I remember some kind of issue with the tech. details" is not enough). Note that it works with the current implicit resolution rules (https://gist.github.com/Blaisorblade/6089067).

{code}
object bip {
  class Foo(val xxx: Int)
  implicit object Foo extends (Int => Foo) { def apply(x: Int) = new Foo(x) }
}
{code}

My colleague Tillmann Rendel came up again with this encoding.

EDIT: So, why don't we use this desugaring?
Whoops, agreed. (EDIT: maybe we can avoid using function types - but objects are also not type-polymorphic, and changing that makes no sense).

And the obvious fixes require using a method instead of a companion object, at least for the implicit conversion (EDIT: which is the original encoding). I can imagine moving {{unapply}} to the method instead:
{code}
implicit def Foo = new {
  def apply(x: Int) = new Foo(x)
  def unapply(x: Foo) = ...
}
{code}
but not only this doesn't work nowadays, I'm not even sure it is a good idea, since {{Foo.unapply}} could refer to different methods. If that's not a problem, that encoding might be superior, but requires significant changes.

It seems that the only alternative is that the implicit conversion's name is derived in a documented way from the class name, either only for case classes (which preserves compatibility) or also for other classes (which ensures consistency).
