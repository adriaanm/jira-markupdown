=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
build file with scaladoc

/**
 * Subclass of <code>org.jmock.Expectations</code> that provides <code>withArg</code>
 * alternatives to the <code>with</code> methods defined in its superclass.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>JMockCycle</code>'s <code>expecting</code> method of passes an instance of this class
 * to the function passed into <code>expectations</code>. Because <code>JMockExpectations</code>
 * extends <code>org.jmock.Expectations</code>, all of the <code>Expectations</code> methods are
 * available to be invoked on instances of this class, in addition to
 * several overloaded <code>withArg</code> methods defined in this class. These <code>withArg</code> methods simply
 * invoke corresponding <code>with</code> methods on <code>this</code>. Because <code>with</code> is
 * a keyword in Scala, to invoke these directly you must surround them in back ticks, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * oneOf (mockCollaborator).documentAdded(`with`("Document"))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * By importing the members of the <code>JMockExpectations</code> object passed to
 * a <code>JMockCycle</code>'s <code>executing</code> method, you can
 * instead call <code>withArg</code> with no back ticks needed:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * oneOf (mockCollaborator).documentAdded(withArg("Document"))
 * </pre>

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

fully qualified name:

org.hamcrest.Matcher

=== What do you see instead? ===

Matcher

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

In JMockSugar. some of the methods take a Matcher, but it just says
Matcher. Well that's a org.hamcrest.Matcher, not a
org.scalatest.Matcher, and there's no way to tell from the
documentation

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

As this ticket stands, this is not reproducible. It requiers a now-dated version of ScalaTest source. I dug around for a bit in ScalaTest source and Scaladoc, and it seems that `JMockSugar` doesn't exist any longer, so I can't get a full idea of what's really happening at this point.

In general, self-contained and minimized code examples are what we need to issue a fix.

Can you please submit a self-contained (i.e. not dependent on ScalaTest source) example?

```scala
$ cat A.scala
package a {
  class A
}
package b {
  class A
}

$ scalac A.scala

$ cat B.scala
package a {
  class B {
    def fooA(a: A) = 3
    def fooB(a: b.A) = 4
  }
}

$ scaladoc B.scala
model contains 3 documentable templates
```
In the scaladoc page you'll get: 
```scala
def fooA(a: A): Int
def fooB(a: A): Int
```

The tooltips will indicate the correct entities (a.A and b.A) but that doesn't make it much better.
I need to have a look at the scala type printers and see if I can reuse some of the infrastructure there.
Ah, ok, I see now-- wasn't clear to me from the description. 

So, I suppose, in an effort to support fully-qualified names being generated in some scenarios, but not in others (we don't want them generated all over the place when they don't need to be) we could at the entity-level: check if there are two or more types that appear with the same name, if so, compare the fully-qualified names, and append the prefixes to the entity name as follows:
```scala
scala.collection.immutable.HashMap -> immutable.HashMap
scala.collection.mutable.HashMap -> mutable.HashMap
org.scalay.collection.immutable.HashMap -> org.scalay.collection.immutable.HashMap
```

It's certainly possible, but the way I see to do it is to, as we produce the page template in Template.scala for a given entity, collect the fully-qualified names of every type/entity we encounter (i.e. param lists of members, return types, etc) in a Set or something private and top-level in Template.scala. But then the issue is that afterwards, we'd need to make a second pass through the whole page and rewrite duplicate-named entities with the qualified/fully-qualified names, where necessary. ...Which would require a larger refactoring... (Unless there's an easier way to do it that I'm missing, maybe in the model or something...)

But...

**Workaround:** in the meantime, one could use a use-case to insert better-qualified/fully-qualified names where needed.
