The following code compiles with 2.12 (but it shouldn't) and doesn't compile with plain 2.11
```java
abstract class Node(name: String) {
  var value: Option[Boolean] = None
}

case class Group(name: String, nodes: Node*) extends Node(name) {
  override def value = ???

  override def value_=(b: Option[Boolean]) = ???

}
```
