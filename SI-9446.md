```
object Foo { def unapply(a: (_, Any)): Option[Any] = None }
("", 1) match {
  case ("a", i) => 1
  case Foo(j) => j
}
```

yields:
```
<console>:11: error: error during expansion of this match (this is a scalac bug).
The underlying error was: type mismatch;
 found   : _$1
 required: String
              ("", 1) match {
```

Changing "(_, Any)" to "(String, Any)" or removing the first, seemingly unrelated, case (`(a, i) => i`) allows it to compile.
