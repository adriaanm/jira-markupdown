The "object Anno" needs a member "object Value" which it has not been given.  Either that or we need to do better at being flexible when someone uses a path involving java classes, and treat the dots as type selections when necessary and valid in java.

scala> import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> typeOf[Anno].declarations
res1: reflect.runtime.universe.MemberScope = SynchronizedOps(class Value, object Value, method value)

// Geez, is this really the most direct route to the type of the companion
scala> typeOf[Anno].typeSymbol.companionSymbol.typeSignature.declarations
res2: reflect.runtime.universe.MemberScope = SynchronizedOps(class Value)
