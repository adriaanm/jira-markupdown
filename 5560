Speaking only of [Xhtml|http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#strict], we have the following rules:

# It must be an XML Document
# It must conform to one of certain pre-defined DTDs.
# The root element of the document must be {{html}}.
# The root element of the document must contain an {{xmlns}} declaration.
# There must be a {{DOCTYPE}} declaration in the document prior to the root element.
# The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD

From the pre-requisite of it needing to be an XML Document, we have [this|http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-well-formed] requirement, indicating that it must follow the production rule {{prolog element Misc*}}, where {{prolog}} and {{Misc}} contain only the xml declaration, comments, processing instructions, spaces and newlines.

So, taken all together, {{XhtmlParser}} should complain about the following:

# There's more than one root.
# It does not conform to any of the valid DTDs.
# The root is not called {{html}}.
# The root does not contain a {{xmlns}} declaration.
# There's no {{DOCTYPE}} declaration prior to the root.

I expect such strictness to be detrimental instead of a feature for most applications. However, _failing_ and still returning something -- that does not represent the input given -- is definitely very bad.

For whatever it is worth, this reminds me a lot of SI-4520. Though the symptom is rather different, I suspect they both arise from the lack of an exception.
