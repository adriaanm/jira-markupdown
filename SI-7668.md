The following code:

{code}
trait Space {
  type T
  val x: T
}

trait Extractor {
  def extract(s: Space): s.T
}

new Extractor {
  def extract(s: Space) = s.x
}
{code}

gives the error:

{quote}
type mismatch;
 found   : s.x.type (with underlying type s.T)
 required: s.T
    def extract(s: Space) = s.x
                              ^
{quote}

Adding a type annotation to the return type in the line:

{code}
def extract(s: Space): s.T = s.x
{code}

makes the error go away.

I am not sure if this code should produce an error or not, but I am sure that the error message is not useful in debugging the problem.
