Scaladoc of `Product`, `ProductXX` and `FunctionXX` could be better; docs are inconsistent and imprecise

Two patches included (both apply against [r23561]):

1. `ProductAndGenProd.diff.gz` - this has some changes to `Product.scala` and `genprod.scala`.  Doc improvements include consistency, correctness, and completness
2. `ProductFunctionGenerated.diff.gz` - this is the results of running `genprod` on the codebase; I couldn't find a way to do this from the ant file, but things seem to work more or less.
