The code in isSymlink is just wrong:

 - it returns "true" if the file is no symlink, but some parent folder is a symlink
 - it returns "true" if the file doesn't even exist, but some parent folder is a symlink
 - it returns "false" if the file is a symlink, but the target is not existing

There is some code floating around which can fix the first two problems (take a look at http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/io/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.java?view=markup ) but it is not possible to fix the third.

There is currently no way to make this is even remotely correct without resorting to JNI or executing commands on the operating system's shell.
The right thing here is IMHO to stop pretending that this functionality can be provided by Path, remove it (and maybe reintroduce it when java.nio.file finally arrives ( http://download.java.net/jdk7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#isSymbolicLink%28java.nio.file.Path%29 ).
(extempore in [r25123](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25123)) Removed an unused method.  Closes #4708, no review.
