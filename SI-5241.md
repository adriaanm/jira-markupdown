`StringBuilder.++=(xs: TraversableOnce[Char])` is much slower than `StringBuilder.append(s: String)`. In my benchmark, about 30% slower than append.

Thus, for best performance, it's better to use ` append ` to a ` String ` instead of ` ++= `.

But it's hard to mix `append` and `++=` in one line:
```scala
// error: value append is not a member of Seq[Char]
new StringBuilder ++= Seq('H', 'e', 'l') append "llo"
```

This error occured due to low priority of operation `++=` . To allow mix append string after append a `Seq[Char]`, there should be a ++= method for String in StringBuilder. Then I can write like this without addition cost:

```scala
new StringBuilder ++= Seq('H', 'e', 'l') ++= "llo"
```
