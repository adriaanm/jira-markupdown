This code fails at runtime:
{code}
scala> class A(val p: Int*); case class B(p1: Int) extends A(p1); new B(1)
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.mutable.WrappedArray$ofInt cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer
{code}

The error only occurs in combination of a case class extending a class taking a vararg ctor that is marked as val.

Looking at the generated code the bug is obvious:
{code}
def p1(): Int = scala.Int.unbox(Main$$anon$1$B.super.p());
{code}
and
{code}
def <init>($outer: anonymous class anon$1, p1: Int): anonymous class anon$1$B = {
      Main$$anon$1$B.super.<init>($outer, scala.this.Predef.wrapIntArray(Array[Int]{p1}));
      scala.Product$class./*Product$class*/$init$(Main$$anon$1$B.this);
      ()
    }
  };

{code}
p1 is not correctly set in the ctor of B. Instead it treats p as the same value and tries to get the value from it. 
I raised a question that lead to this bug http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16294822/constructors-in-scala-with-varargs

In Java I need varargs in order to make any thing even slightly approaching a DSL (mostly in tests). I don't know if the need is as great in Scala. 

The example in the link shows what I think is a sensible use of varargs. I have an alternative implementation using Lists, but the code is much more verbose and not nearly as readable. I'd really appreciate some idiomatically correct code that did the same thing as the example not using val p:Int*

Akin to SI-6793
Are you sure it is fixed? Because

Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3-RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_33).

Hi there, I still see this bug in 2.10.3-RC2. I don't think it was fixed

{code}

It seems to be that this is a regression, as this works in Scala 2.10.0, however it does not work in any newer bugfix 2.10 version (i.e. 2.10.1, 2.10.2, 2.10.3 and 2.10.4-RC2). I believe that as this works in 2.10.0, it should work in all 2.10.x versions.

My test case is not as elegant as the one initially posted, but for completeness, here it is:

{code:scala}
object Blah extends App {

  trait ArgProvider {
  }

  case class ColumnReference(value: String) extends ArgProvider


  abstract class Rule(name: String, val argProviders: ArgProvider*)

  case class InRule(inValue: ArgProvider) extends Rule("in", inValue) {

    def valid(): Boolean = {
      println(inValue.getClass) //This causes a ClassCastException on 2.10.1+ but not 2.10.0

      true
    }
  }

  val rule = InRule(ColumnReference("Column1"))
  rule.valid()
}
{code}

I have been suggested the workaround of defining the `InRule` class as:

{code:scala}
case class InRule(inValue: ArgProvider) extends Rule("in", Seq(inValue): _*) {
  ...
}
{code}

Whilst the workaround helps me, I still have to modify my code to move onward from 2.10.0 to 2.10.1+ which is not ideal.
