There really *is* a cyclic dependency: when type checking the application, we need to type-check the named argument to test if it's a valid assignment expression.

So I think the error is not wrong. Giving an explicit type either to "a" or "y" is the correct way of fixing the code.

However the error message is not very explicit about what to do. This is done in [https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/4669ac180e58daf97ac7f73af4622434b439631d]
