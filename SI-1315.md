I just updated to #15978 nightly of the eclipse plugin and fell over this strange issue:

I instanciated a protected child class like this:
```scala
new AjaxEditableLabel( componentId, m ) ) {
  override def newLabel( parent: MarkupContainer, id: String, model: IModel ) =
  {
    val label = new Label( id, createLabelModel( m ) )
    label.setOutputMarkupId( true )
    label.add( new LabelAjaxBehavior( this, getLabelAjaxEvent ) )
  }
}
```
LabelAjaxBehavior is the protected inner class, which has a constructor
```scala
AjaxEditableLabel.LabelAjaxBehavior(java.lang.String event)
```
Now, prior it was necessary as in above example to provide a 'this' to the
current AjaxEditableLabel instance. The eclipse plugin insists on this, too, in
the current nightly.

The strange thing is, the compiler seems to add another parameter to 'this' and
I get an exception during runtime:
```scala
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError:
org.apache.wicket.extensions.ajax.markup.html.AjaxEditableLabel$$LabelAjaxBehavior.<init>
(Lorg/apache/wicket/extensions/ajax/markup/html/AjaxEditableLabel;Lorg/apache/wicket/extensions/ajax/markup/html/AjaxEditableLabel;Ljava/lang/String;)V
```
Any idea what caused this? The nightly from June, 29th didn't have this problem.
Has the plugin to be adjusted, that the 'this' reference can be omitted?
