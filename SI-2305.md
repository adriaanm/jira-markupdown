This is similar, but not identical to #2266.

See attachments for log of the error and the .scala file to reproduce. It works in 2.7.5, but is broken in 2.8.0.r18583-b20090827020153

I think the change to TypeRef.isHigherKinded in r18480 could be the culprit -- ArrayList is not considered as higher kinded because it is a Java type.
fixed in r18635. sorry about the breakage!
(note that #2266 is closely related, but there a more involved fix is required)
