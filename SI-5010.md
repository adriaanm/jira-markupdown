If we have some fields:

@Column(name="SOME_FIELD_ONE")
@BeanProperty var someFieldOne: String = _

@Column(name="SOME_FIELD_TWO", nullable=false, length=254)
@BeanProperty var someFieldTwo: String = _

in a trait, and inherit that trait in one of our entities our tests break with 2.9.x.  Moving the fields directly into our entities illustrates they are setup correctly.

We had similar issues with @BeanProperty with our upgrade to 2.8.x.

We are using JPA/Hibernate and Scalatest in our env.
We are seeing a similar issue in Scala 2.9.x. We have a base trait in which we have fields decorated with JAXB annotations. Derived classes which mix-in this trait are (un)marshalled correctly by JAXB in Scala 2.8.1, but not in Scala 2.9.0 or Scala 2.9.1 There is some discussion of this issue -- with sample code -- on the Scala Google groups list here:
