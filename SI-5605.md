scala> case class Error(x : Int)(y : Int)
defined class Error

scala> Error(1)(0) == Error(1)(2)
res0: Boolean = true
I think that's the way it's meant to behave. Still, the language spec says otherwise:


*Method equals: (Any)Boolean is structural equality, where two instances are equal if they both belong to the case class in question and they have equal (with respect to equals) constructor arguments.* ([Scala Language Reference](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf), page 68)

It should probably say constructor arguments in the first parameter section. 
My usecase was adding additional tagging information to AST nodes. I did not want tagging to influence pattern matching and equality but at the same time I didn't want to have a separate map for the tags. Before I learned about curried case class arguments I used:
```scala
case class Node(info: Info) { var tag: SomeTag /* two classses with the same info but with different tags SHOULD be equal */ }
```

which could be replaced by:

```scala
case class Node(info: Info)(var tag: SomeTag)
```

Indeed, if you care about the implicit parameters in equality and hashCode, then it's a pain. Here's a (long) workaround:
```scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

case class A(i: Int, j: String)
object A {
  class AvoidErasure
  implicit val avoidErasure = new AvoidErasure
  // simply defining apply(i: Int)(implicit j: String) will cause the erasure phase to complain
  def apply(i: Int)(implicit j: String, ae: AvoidErasure) = new A(i, j)
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class A
defined module A

scala> implicit val theString="hello"
theString: String = hello

scala> A(3).j
res0: String = hello
```
IMHO, the major problem is that the treatment of "case" classes just does not belong to the core language - it should be part of a library, so that different variants could be easily added, too. I just opened a request for improvement (#5607) about this.

If we had something like
```scala
@case class foo(i: Int, j: Int)
```
it would become easy to support things like:
```scala
@case(all_param_lists=true) class foo(i: Int, j: Int)
```
or whichever other syntax is preferred.
#5607 has been moved to SUGGEST-23
> I can't see why you would want this behavior. Can you give an example?

It is by design.  An example is anytime you want to be able to construct case classes without every parameter both receiving a field and being considered part of the class's equality contract.  Surely examples of this are not hard to come by.

The spec should be made more explicit, but the standard case class behavior isn't likely to change.
