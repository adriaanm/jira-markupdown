As reported at https://github.com/scala/scala/issues/4392, not everyone appreciates REPL's colon-command syntax. Since JLine already supports vi mode line edits, one accommodation would be to recognize a colon while in escaped edit mode, erase the line, draw a colon and accept command text.

This improvement would delight that fraction of users who <3 vi and also use a lot of ::.  Probably under a flag.

This would make even more sense with line healing enabled.
{noformat}
scala> 42
res0: Int = 42

scala> :: Nil
res1: List[Int] = List(42)
{noformat}


This is "fixed" in the [Ammonite REPL|http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL], which doesn't use special colon-commands at all

{code:scala}
@ 42
res4: Int = 42
@ ::
res5: scala.collection.immutable.::.type = ::
{code}

I have never used vim mode, but since we're not hogging syntax you could give it a shot
