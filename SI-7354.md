The following code:

{noformat}
import scala.math.Fractional
class Prob[N](val toN: N) extends AnyVal
object Prob {
  implicit def ProbOrdering[N](implicit N: Fractional[N]): Ordering[Prob[N]] = N.on[Prob[N]](_.toN)
}
{noformat}

generates the error:

{noformat}
bridge generated for member method apply: (x$1: org.ptflame.probability.Prob[N])x$1.toN.type forSome { val x$1: org.ptflame.probability.Prob[N] } in anonymous class $anonfun which overrides method apply: (v1: T1)R in trait Function1 clashes with definition of the member itself; both have erased type (v1: Object)Object
{noformat}

This code should work in the obvious fashion.  If `extends AnyVal` is removed, the error disappears.
More minimally:

{code}
class Prob(val toN: Any) extends AnyVal
object Prob {
  (_: Prob).toN
}
{code}
Thanks, I'm merging this into SI-6260.
