This is not related to the issue, but I think I can post it here:
```scala
class Page protected[TabbedPane](parent0: TabbedPane, title0: String, content0: Component, tip0: String) extends Proxy {

  ...
  def index = if(parent != null) parent.peer.indexOfTab(title) else 0
}
```

It is wrong. You can not get the index of a tab/ page by its title. Please fix it.
