This commit [1] introduced a binary incompatibility in the collections
library, as shown here [2]. I remember a related discussion between
with Paul/Alex, but I can't dig it up.

This makes it a bit hard to validate the recent compiler performance
improvements on our larger projects, as we would need to update the
dependencies.

Maybe @bridge method can be added to provide a binary compatible signature.
