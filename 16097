= analysis =
It would be nice to receive some optional warning if the checks are not exhaustive and get an example value, which would result in a match error.

Like "Note: (true, true) and (false, false) are not checked and will result in a MatchError." in the last example.

= enhancement recommendation =
Add such a check to the compiler.
