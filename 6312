The fix in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4026 only works under separate compilation, because annotations are skipped by the Java parser. We have an open issue for this: scala/bug#8928, so this one can be closed.
```scala
@Retention(value=SOURCE) // not parsed by the Java parser
@interface SAnnotation {}
```

Tests updated accordingly in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5606.
