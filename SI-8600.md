By-name thunks are often used for things like logging expressions, Option.fold(), and various other situations where an argument may well be completely ignored -- so as to avoid the extra computation. For instance:

{code}
def warn(s: => String) {
  println(s)
}
{code}

However, this always generates an anonymous function class, even when the expression is known by the compiler to be constant. Add enough of these (particularly debug logging), and an app can get pretty unwieldy in terms of anonymous class proliferation.

If the compiler is able to determine that the argument is indeed constant, or a variable that can be passed as-is without computation, it could collapse all such instances into a constant function helper class, for instance:

{code}
package scala.runtime
case class ConstantFunction0[T](apply: T) extends AbstractFunction0[T]
{code}

Then, rather than generate an anonymous function class consisting only of one load opcode for a constant field value, or a single final field, it could use the above class as-is.
Thanks, I'll pull the branch over and take a look. The biggest win, by far, appears to be by-name args, so that would be the main focus.

For the use case of functions that take explicit arguments, perhaps making it an exposed API would be easier and more clear in intent? For instance (not counting specialization):

{code}
package scala.runtime

final class Const1[A, T](x: T) extends AbstractFunction1[A, T] {
  def apply(a: A) = x
}

final class Const2[A, B, T](x: T) extends AbstractFunction2[A, B, T] {
  def apply(a: A, b: B) = x
}

// =====

package scala

object Const {
  @inline def apply[T, A](x: T): (A) => T = new Const1[A, T](x)
  @inline def apply[T, A, B](x: T): (A, B) => T = new Const2[A, B, T](x)
}

// =====

def foo(f: (String) => String)
// ...
foo(Const("bar"))
{code}

The type parameters disambiguate the apply() method for the compiler, and the return types disambiguate it for the VM (Function1, Function2, ...).

This _could_ even be implicit, though I'm wary of that usage as it would need a very loud warning to potential users. As implicit, the above {{foo}} function could be called as:

{code}
foo("bar")
{code}

which has both good points (such as conciseness) and bad (human ambiguity of function name overloading, and most importantly, *non*-deferral of evaluation).

I've had a "Const" helper class in my personal utility library for ages and haven't really considered how it would best fit into the main library.
Well, third-party libraries don't necessarily try very hard to make their by-name-accepting functions inline friendly (definitely without an {{@inline}} hint in many cases).

I'm more interested in eliding a pointless anonymous class regardless of inline behavior, so that (for instance) an app intentionally compiled without {{-optimise}}, with a bunch of debug-level logging, wouldn't greatly inflate to the point of having more classes containing static debug messages than actual code.
