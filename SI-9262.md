```scala
object Foo {
  def bar[A](a1: A)(a2: A) = {}
}

Foo.bar(Left(1))(Right(2))
```

does not compile:

```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.util.Right[Nothing,Int]
 required: scala.util.Left[Int,Nothing]
              Foo.bar(Left(1))(Right(2))
                                    ^
```

If a single parameter list is used, A is inferred as Either[Int, Int], as hoped.

```scala
object Foo {
  def bar[A](a1: A, a2: A) = {}
}

Foo.bar(Left(1), Right(2))
```

A real-world example of this is Option.fold, which requires an explicit type in circumstances where pattern-matching, or map/getOrElse would not.
Yes, this behaviour or inference runs pretty deeply through the way that applications are type checked, and it is relied upon in APIs like `foldLeft`, which allow the constraints accumulated by considering the first argument list to allow you to omit types in the second argument list.

```scala
def foo[A, B](a: A)(f: A => B)
foo(1)(x => -x) // no need to write `x: Int => -x` here
```
