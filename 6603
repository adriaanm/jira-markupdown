Hi, just a day or two ago, unrelated to this ticket, I clarified the API docs. I wouldn't say that they're more detailed than your proposition here, but I do think they're clearer (as a minimal example is included). It also points to the relevant portion of the spec.

Here's the [commit|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/706f19ae614b36715ad4515cbe85166f8a19758b]
And the [nightly Scaladoc|http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.DelayedInit]

So, I'm closing this-- please submit a pull request with further clarifications if you feel they're necessary.
