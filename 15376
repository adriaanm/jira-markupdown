Hello, I discovered a bug in Stream.splitAt method as it does not terminate in Scala 2.8.0.RC3.

See REPL session that explains it clearly:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.                                           
Type :help for more information.                                                      

scala> val s = Stream.from(1)
s: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> val (s1, s2) = (s take 10, s drop 10)
s1: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)
s2: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(11, ?)

scala> val (ss1, ss2) = s splitAt 10
```

The last line does not terminate (actually it throw OOM exception eventually).
