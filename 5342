I should never have allowed that patch at the time. I had a bad feeling about it, because it was checked in without changing the spec. I have since then become much stricter in that respect. The problem now is that we have to make illegal some code that worked before. That's always a mine field. You never know what will blow up when you do that.
 
I'll change the inferred result type. But somebody else needs to follow up on the eta expansion, or we leave it as a won't fix. I simply do not have the bandwidth anymore to follow breakages in user code which will inevitably happen when we do this.
