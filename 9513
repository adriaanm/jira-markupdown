> Anyway, I'm just going to import the features

Apparently, the message worked.

But it would be nice to have a mechanism for turning on verboser messages.

The converse of -Xdev, but without calling it -noob.  Sometimes you just want scalac to tell you everything it knows (and that might help).  Maybe -explain, by analogy to -explaintypes.

Or scala.language.feature.explanations. Then you get some fine control over where it is applied.  And you wouldn't have to go on scala-user for Jason to tell you to use -Xlog-implicits.

-Xlint could go bonkers when explanations are enabled.

A new error type could be emitted:

error: code this bad needs to be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.explanations visible.
Then I'll tell you everything you just did wrong.
