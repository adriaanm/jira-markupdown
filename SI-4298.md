=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Create a !StringBuilder in the REPL
```scala
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder()
sb: StringBuilder = 

scala> sb ++= "Hello"
res0: sb.type = Hello
```

To get resulting string out of the StringBuilder we call 'toString' and 'result'.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
In Scala 2.8.1 we get:
```scala
scala> sb.toString
res1: java.lang.String = Hello

scala> sb.result
res2: String = Hello
```

=== What do you see instead? ===
However, in 2.9 nightly I see:
```scala
scala> sb.toString
res1: java.lang.String = Hello

scala> sb.result
res2: StringBuilder = Hello
```

As you see the result type of method 'result' has changed to !StringBuilder from String.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.!r24347-b20110225020040
  - Java: Java !HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6
In 2.8.1 there was also this:
```scala
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder ++= "Hello World"
sb: StringBuilder = StringBuilder(H, e, l, l, o,  , W, o, r, l, d)

scala> sb dropRight 1 toString                     
res0: String = ArrayBuffer(H, e, l, l, o,  , W, o, r, l)

scala> sb.toString dropRight 1
res1: String = Hello Worl  
```
Now it acts like this:
```scala
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder ++= "Hello World"
sb: StringBuilder = Hello World

scala> sb dropRight 1 toString
res0: java.lang.String = Hello Worl

scala> sb.toString dropRight 1
res1: String = Hello Worl  
```
It is able to behave this way because StringBuilder is now a Builder for StringBuilders, not for Strings.

A consequence of this is that .result() returns a StringBuilder.

I don't see any way to change this, nor any reason that calling result represents an improvement.  (I realize the change is undesirable simply for being a change, but it is otherwise an improvement.)
Your reasoning for the change is to make the order of applying `dropRight` and `toString` to a `StringBuilder` insignificant:
```scala
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder ++= "Hello World"
sb: StringBuilder = Hello World

scala> sb dropRight 1 toString
res0: java.lang.String = Hello Worl

scala> sb.toString dropRight 1
res1: String = Hello Worl  
```
However, it seems like a random requirement. Also, it does not hold for Builders in general:
```scala
scala> val lb = new collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int]()
lb: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer()

scala> lb append (1,2,3)

scala> lb dropRight 1 toString
res41: String = ListBuffer(1, 2)

scala> lb.toString dropRight 1
res42: String = ListBuffer(1, 2, 3
```
It seems like a much more relevant requirement to respect the general contract of a Builder:
 * A !ListBuffer (a list builder) builds a List
 * An !ArrayBuilder builds an Array
 * ...and a !StringBuilder should build a String
The expected contract of a Builder of *Foo* is that calling its `result` method should return a `Foo`.
This contract is also more or less implied by the Scaladoc of trait `scala.collection.mutable.Builder`.

Finally, this is a breaking change. Code (like ours) that relies on calling `result` on a `StringBuilder`, no longer works. This is probably the best reason for reverting this change in 2.9.
I do not claim to understand everything yet, but the complaint looks plausible. 
If I compare with ListBuffer, that class inherits from:
```scala
         ...
         with BufferLike[A, ListBuffer[A]]
         with Builder[A, List[A]] 
```
So all sequence operations on `ListBuffer` yield again a `ListBuffer`, but `result` yields a `List`. Is there a reason why we can't do the same for `StringBuilder`?

I can't tell.  I just burned off too much time investigating that question, and I still don't know.  I think StringLike needs to be dropped from the parents or be given another type parameter.  But more importantly, I can't spend time on this right now.  I can revert the previous change, or I can leave it.

Looks good!

Please remember to update the Scaladoc for function `result` as well. It still says:
```scala
/** Returns the result of this Builder, which in the case
 *  of StringBuilders is a StringBuilder (not a String.)
 *
 *  @return  this StringBuilder
 */
```
(In r24688) Fixes #4298, by correcting doc comment
