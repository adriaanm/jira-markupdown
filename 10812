I want to allow user writing value classes so they can use it in their code.
```scala
class Meter(val value: Double) extends AnyVal {
  def +(other: Meter) = new Meter(value + other.value)
}

val t = new Meter(1.0) + new Meter(2.0)
```

should instrument to {code}List((4, Meter(3)){code} where 4 is the line #

see attachement :P
