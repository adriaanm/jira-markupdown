A related problem is SI-4308.

I wonder if we have to decide whether to reject things like "Int.MinValue to Int.MaxValue" (by assuming step size is 1) and fail fast or if it is possible to see if there is a "by someInt" following, resulting in an amount of less than Int.MaxValue elements.

Currently both approaches don't work reliably.
