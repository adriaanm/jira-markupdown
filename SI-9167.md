When compiling Scala (from Download page, or from GitHub either .zip or git clone), I have an error like this one.

I saw https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8711 but it is said to be fixed.
I'm blocked.

I used to have to supply {{build.properties}} in previous years when building on cygwin, where the windows git path wouldn't work.

Supplying properties fixes the issue:

{code}
git.commit.sha=897342cda9
git.commit.date=20150220-010825
version.number=2.11.6
{code}
For completeness, the output of the init target when run on the unzipped src instead of a git repo.

The error text shows up in buildcharacter.properties, so-called because it builds character, of course.

In the stack trace, init fails because of a version field; if the version string is bad, you're done.

The bad string has the form "2.11.5--\nSome git error message." So the git message in the description is actually part of the string.

This PR makes it more robust, but a multiline version string is not correctly added to the jar manifest, so the build eventually fails anyway.

I've tried to add a file   build.properties   as suggested by A.P. Marki.
Still in my NOT-Git Scala directory.

# cat build.properties
