I think the diagnosis is correct, that there is a misunderstanding.

The warning is just saying that the variable shutdownHook is not read.  Maybe you forgot to do something useful with it:

{code}
      if (i > 50) { Console println s"Unhooking: ${shutdownHook.remove()}" ; sys exit 0 }
{code}

The excellent ScalaDoc notes: "The hook is automatically registered: the returned value can be ignored."  That is, you don't need to hold the reference.
