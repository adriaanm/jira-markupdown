The `^^^` operator in the parser combinators library still executes the function even if the parser fails. The JavaDoc on the `^^^` operator isn't very informative, but I assume it acts the same as the `^^` operator where the function only executes if the parser is successful. The following code snippet deomonstrates this behaviour:
```scala
import scala.util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers

object Test extends RegexParsers {

  var mut = "x"

  def input = 
    "a" | "b" ^^^ { mut = "y" }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    assert(mut == "x")
    parseAll(input, "a") //Parse Success
    assert(mut == "x")
    parseAll(input, "c") //Parse Fail
    println(mut) //mut is now "y"
  }

}
```
