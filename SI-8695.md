Actual result:
"1010".combinations(2).toList
res1: List[String] = List(11, 10, 00)

Expected result:
List(11,10,01,00)

Actual result:
"1010".combinations(3).toList
res2: List[String] = List(110, 100)

Expected result:
List(101, 100, 110, 011)

I'm not really sure what this function should do to be honest. Is it attempting to give me every subset that can be generated by dropping 1+ elements at every index? It's useage is unclear, and it's documentation doesn't really explain what's going on. If nothing else, I expect it to give me 4 results when given 3 as an argument as 4C3 is 4.
