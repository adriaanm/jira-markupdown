@ruippeixotog Well, there's the empty case, `enqueue()`, though I can't imagine why that would have been used.  And if anyone extended `mutable.Queue` this definitely requires a good bit of work to retain compatibility.  But it's not a bad idea.  Maybe worth moving it up to 2.12 and seeing who complains?  Maybe after we survey projects out there and see how often if ever we see `mutable.Queue` extended.
