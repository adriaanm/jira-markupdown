The following two snippets must live in different files.

First a sealed `Base` hierarchy.
{code:scala}
sealed abstract class Base

sealed trait A extends Base

object A {

  case object Root extends Base

  def apply(param: String): A = {
      new A {}
  }
}
{code}

Then trying to pattern match:
{code:scala}
object ExhaustiveMatchWarning {

  def test {
    val b: Base = A("blabla")
    b match {
      case A.Root => println("Root")
      case path: A => println("Not root")
    }
  }
}
{code}

produces a warning
{code}
[warn] [...]/ExhaustiveMatchWarning.scala:5: match may not be exhaustive.
[warn] It would fail on the following input: (_ : this.<local child>)
[warn]     b match {
[warn]     ^
[warn] one warning found
{code}
