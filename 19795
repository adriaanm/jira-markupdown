The signature of List.foldLeft is
{{def foldLeft[B](z: B)(f: (B, A) â‡’ B): B}}
In the doc, the description for the type B and the argument z exists but for the binary operator f is missing.

I think this is not a bug of doc but a missnaming of the argument "f".
Renaming "f" to "op" will fix this bug, and I think we should rename it instead of modifying the doc.
