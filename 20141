This code can be compiled by scala 2.11.8 but scala 2.12.0-M5 does not compile it with error message "error during expansion of this match (this is a scalac bug). The underlying error was: type mismatch; found : x1.type (with underlying type CharSequence) required: String"
```scala
  def xx(verb: String, a: Array[Int]) {
    val reYYYY = """(\d\d\d\d)""".r
    verb match {
      case "time" if a.isEmpty =>
      case "time"              =>
      case reYYYY(y)           =>
    }
  }
```
