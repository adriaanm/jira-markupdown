A language change like this would need a SIP. I suspect interaction with overloading would complicate specification.

The implementation does actually have an experimental version of this:
```scala
~/code/scala scala -Yinfer-argument-types 
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_27).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> trait T { def foo(a: Any): Int }
defined trait T

scala> object O extends T { def foo(a) = a.hashCode }
defined module O
```
