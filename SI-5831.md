When I compile (with sbt 0.11.2) the code in the following GitHub repo:

https://github.com/paulbutcher/scala-macro-bug

I *sometimes* get:

{quote}
[error] /Users/paul/scala/foo/src/main/scala/Base.scala:2: overriding value factory in trait Mock of type c.Expr[MockFactoryBase];
[error]  value factory needs `override' modifier
[error]   implicit val factory = this
[error]                ^
{quote}

On other occasions, it compiles with no error.

The error seems to happen reliably if the Base.scala file has a more recent modification date than Trait.scala, and reliably not happen if Trait.scala has the more recent modification date.

I've marked this as "Macros" as I can't create an example that reproduces this problem without using macros, but I don't know for certain that the problem is specifically related to macros.
