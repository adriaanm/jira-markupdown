= problem =
Example: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/swing/TabbedPane$$$$Page.html

= analysis =
The way ScalaDoc displays properties isn't really nice.
Especially the way they are displayed (`def enabled_= (b: Boolean) ` doesn't reflect the way they should be used (` enabled = true `).

= enhancement recommendation =
There has to be a better way than displaying getter/setter combinations. A first improvement may be the removal of the horizontal bar between getter/setter, but it would make sense to think about a property view which combines getter/setter into one entry, even if that would mean abstracting a bit over the implementation details.
