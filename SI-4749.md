I have an entry point wrapper that looks something like the trait listed below that is intended to expose a main for a java entry point if type T = Unit or an arbitrary return type T if the module is embedded:

{code}
trait RunWrapper[T] {
  def run(args : Array[String]) : T;
  def main(args : Array[String]) : T = {
    try { run(args) } finally { }
  }
}

// Entry point for java
object A extends RunWrapper[Unit] {
  def run(args : Array[String]) { println("the end") }
}
{code}
Unfortunately, I get this bytecode from the compiler (the same for both 2.8.1 and 2.9.0.1):

$ javap A
Compiled from "test.scala"
public final class A extends java.lang.Object{
    public static final java.lang.Object main(java.lang.String[]);
    public static final void run(java.lang.String[]);
}

Why do I get a return type of java.lang.Object, in this case, for main()? How do I get void in this scenario so that java will allow my to use A as an entry point?

However, if I define the following:

object B extends RunWrapper[Unit] {
  def run(args : Array[String]) { println("the end") }
  override def main(args : Array[String]) { try { run(args) } finally { } }
}

I get this:

{noformat}
$ javap B
Compiled from "test.scala"
public final class B extends java.lang.Object{
    public static final void main(java.lang.String[]);
    public static final void run(java.lang.String[]);
    public static final java.lang.Object main(java.lang.String[]);
}
{noformat}

So it seems override didn't override anything  and the compiler doesn't complain or warn about this.  Is this a boxing issue?

OK, let's see here:

The return type of Object in RunWrapper is correct.  This is how generics work.

Unless we special case main, you will have to write a method which is specifically Unit, you can't use a generic implementation because the jvm requires the exact signature.

When I first saw the example I thought there was a bug, but now if there is one I don't know what it is, other than that we should spot a method which looks like it's trying to be an entry point and warn that it is not in fact an entry point.
