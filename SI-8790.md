In the current version of Scala, pattern matching on tuples results in extra objects being created at runtime.

Consider the following MWE:
```scala
object Test {

  def slow(x: Int, y: Int): String = (x, y) match {
  	case (7, 8) => "You got it!"
  	case _ => "No such luck."
  }

  def faster(x: Int, y: Int): String = x match {
  	case 7 => 
  	  y match {
  	  	case 8 => "You got it!"
  	  	case _ => "No such luck."
  	  }
  	case _ => "No such luck."
  }

}
```
where the method `faster` in the above is some attempt to hand-optimise the implementation of the `slow` method. (I know that I will now have a duplicated case in the generated code, but you get the idea: the pair `(x,y)` has been eliminated.)

Compiling with `scalac -print` we see that the pattern matcher generates a Tuple2 when generating the bytecode for `slow`:
```
package <empty> {
  object Test extends Object {
    def slow(x: Int, y: Int): String = {
      case <synthetic> val x1: Tuple2 = new Tuple2$mcII$sp(x, y);
      case8(){
        if (x1.ne(null))
          {
            <synthetic> val p2: Int = x1._1$mcI$sp();
            <synthetic> val p3: Int = x1._2$mcI$sp();
            if (7.==(p2))
              if (8.==(p3))
                matchEnd7("You got it!")
              else
                case9()
            else
              case9()
          }
        else
          case9()
      };
      case9(){
        matchEnd7("No such luck.")
      };
      matchEnd7(x: String){
        x
      }
    };
    def faster(x: Int, y: Int): String = {
      case <synthetic> val x1: Int = x;
      (x1: Int) match {
        case 7 => {
          case <synthetic> val x1: Int = y;
          (x1: Int) match {
            case 8 => "You got it!"
            case _ => "No such luck."
          }
        }
        case _ => "No such luck."
      }
    };
    def <init>(): Test.type = {
      Test.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

Reading the generated code, we can see that the Tuple generation is unnecessary.

I pattern match on pairs quite often, and the extra strain of short-lived objects such that these Tuples is quite burdensome on the garbage collector, particularly in multi-threaded applications.
Maybe it's possible to do the converse and preserve tuple instances across the arrow.

The issue says, If I create a tuple just to deconstruct it, don't bother constructing it.

This would add, if I deconstruct a tuple just to construct it, just reuse the instance, even though it's a different tuple type.

In other words, avoid reboxing the int and the tuple for (x,i):

```scala
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

sealed trait Fruit
case class Apple(weight: Int = 200) extends Fruit
case object Orange extends Fruit
val fruits = Seq[Fruit](Apple(120), Orange, Orange, Apple())

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined trait Fruit
defined class Apple
defined object Orange
fruits: Seq[Fruit] = List(Apple(120), Orange, Orange, Apple(200))

scala> fruits.zipWithIndex map { case (x: Apple, i: Int) => (x,i) case _  => (null, -1) }
res0: Seq[(Apple, Int)] = List((Apple(120),0), (null,-1), (null,-1), (Apple(200),3))
```

Use case from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/31370395/1296806).
@lrytz Is this case handled by the 2.12 optimizer since (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4858) ? 
Yes, here's the bytecode for `slow` with `-Yopt:l:method`:

```scala
  public slow(II)Ljava/lang/String;
    BIPUSH 7
    ILOAD 1
    IF_ICMPNE L1
    BIPUSH 8
    ILOAD 2
    IF_ICMPNE L1
    LDC "You got it!"
    ASTORE 3
    GOTO L2
    LDC "No such luck."
    ASTORE 3
   L2
    ALOAD 3
    ARETURN
```
