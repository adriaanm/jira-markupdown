When I saw the fix, I say "whao, so simple ! why I didn't think about it ?"
After some though, I know why (some are matter of taste), IMO :
* parent class should no contains special case drive by test of subtype.
* The fixe is not correct (IMO). It fixes the memory leak  but not the hidden part of the problem : *NoPhase break the contract of Phase*.

The Phase type represente a item in a chain, and allow navigation via next or via prev. And NoPhase don't allow navigation form end to end in both sens without including special test case for NoPhase and storing referent Phase.
So the fix could introduce bad side effect, eg if existing code call NoPhase.next during a chain navigation (to go back,...)

May be I'm not clear ?

Sorry for late comments.
