"We could probably support a notion of "overloaded" packages, so that the compiler doesn't have to speculate and can store all the possible options, but that'd require redesign of reflection and probably of the typer as well."

But that was only the beginning, and deterioration began immediately.

Yet another reason it is important is because scanning the entire classpath up front is a very expensive piece of startup time.
