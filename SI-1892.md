Just installed 2.7.4 RC1 in eclipse Version: 3.5.0 Build id: I20090325-1135 on OS X.
I created a project and tried to add a new class, the editor opened with the attached stack trace.
there's more. the second time I try creating a class (foo.Bar), the Java editor opens the new scala class file and there is a build error from the Java compiler: 
Syntax error on token "foo", ; expected after this token	Bar.scala	x/src/foo	line 1	Java Problem
