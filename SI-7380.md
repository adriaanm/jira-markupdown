In Java, I have:
{code:title=java/p/UseIt.java}
package p;

import q.Z;

public class UseIt {
    public static Z getZ() {
        return new Z();
    }
    
    public static q.Z zFullyQualified() {
        return getZ();
    }
}
{code} 
{code:title=java/p/Z.java}
package p;
public class Z {}
{code} 
{code:title=java/q/Z.java}
package q;
public class Z {}
{code}

In Scala:

{code:title=scala/SomeClass.scala}
class SomeClass {
  val z: q.Z = p.UseIt.zFullyQualified
  val z2: q.Z = p.UseIt.getZ //error here
}
{code}

When compiling, there is an error:
{noformat}
src/scala/SomeClass.scala:3: error: type mismatch;
 found   : p.Z
 required: q.Z
  val z2: q.Z = p.UseIt.getZ //error here
                        ^
one error found
{noformat}

This works when the return type in Java is fully qualified.

I think what's causing this is a difference in precedence/shadowing between Scala and Java. In Java, although {{UseIt}} is in package {{p}} and has access to {{p.Z}}, the {{import q.Z}} shadows it:
JLS 6.4.1:
{quote}A single-type-import declaration d in a compilation unit c of package p that imports a type named n shadows, throughout c, the declarations of: 
 * any top level type named n declared in another compilation unit of p{quote}

In the SLS chapter 2, assuming a "compilation unit" includes all classes in a package regardless of which file they are in, the class {{p.Z}} has a higher precedence than the {{import q.Z}}. I assume that when the Scala compiler reads in Java and does the Scala conversion, it ends up mistakenly using the scoping rules from Scala instead of Java.


I'm pretty sure this is a duplicate of SI-7232, I'll just confirm that.
Yep, same bug. Your project compiles with 2.10.2-SNAPSHOT. 2.10.2-RC1 is scheduled for for mid-May.
