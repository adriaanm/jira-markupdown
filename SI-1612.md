In Scala 2.7.1, if ilasm is on the path, the following command:

bin\scalac-net tests\test.scala

issued in the Scala installation directory produces an EXE file.

In Scala 2.7.2 and 2.7.3 RC1, the same command produces only the MSIL source files, and it is necessary to run ilasm as a separate step in order to create an executable.

Environment: Windows Vista, .NET 3.5 SP1, Mono *not* present.
The binaries and sources of Scala.NET (.exe and .dll) can be found at https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scaladotnet
