Running this code
{code}
c.typeCheck(Select(Literal(Constant(10)), TermName("$minus")))
{code}
does not produce any exceptions (as it should), but compilation weirdly fails with an error anyway. {{silent=true}} argument has no affect.

I put minimal example here: https://github.com/aztek/typechecking-bug

Here's what running looks like
{code}
~/typechecking-bug$ sbt run
