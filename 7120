What is this doing in `GenericTraversableTemplate` then?
```scala
  def flatten[B](implicit asTraversable: A => /*<:<!!!*/ GenTraversableOnce[B]): CC[B] = {                      
    val b = genericBuilder[B]                                                                                   
    for (xs <- sequential)                                                                                      
      b ++= asTraversable(xs).seq                                                                               
    b.result                                                                                                    
  }   
```

The method does show up looking the ScalaDoc for it too, but if I click on `List` in the list of subclasses and search again, it has disappeared.

And it does show up on 2.9.1, where scaladoc hasn't gone through the use case changes.
