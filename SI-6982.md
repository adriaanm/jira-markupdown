Having Scala Reflection and reification of ASTs from macros in 2.10 enables interesting use cases for calling into the compiler at runtime, e.g. for typechecking. Depending on scala-compiler for these things has the downside of getting a transitive dependency to JLine which should not be needed for the compiler core. I suggest we split off the command line facade (which needs JLine) from the core as part of the modularization effort for 2.11.
