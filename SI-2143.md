Stream.continually tells you to use Stream.fill instead, but that's wrong; Stream.fill will only give you a finite stream, the purpose of Stream.continually is to provide an infinite stream. I think Stream.continually should not be deprecated at all; see #1979.

Stream.const tells you to use Stream.fill instead, which is wrong for the same reason. I think it should tell you to use Stream.continually.
