+1 review of scripting.

+1 giant collage. Or a Philip Glass opera of which "Blocker Blocker" is merely one act.

I take exception to "the worst piece of software ever known", as I believe I worked on that, on a previous gig.

I just realized that the emails that say "Bug Bug", mean the first "Bug" is the bug icon.

+1 for the name "Martin Quinson". I wish I had thought of it first.
