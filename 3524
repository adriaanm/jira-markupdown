Sorry, you are right. But this is no issue with Windows at all. This happens in linux exactly the same.

I'll restate the problem: In 2.8 the Scala compiler handles newlines in multiline strings specially: The character sequence "\r\n" is replaced by "\n". This changed from 2.7 which IMO showed the correct behaviour: Multiline strings could contain any characters and were converted verbatim on the character-level into a string constant.

The Scala langugage reference says:
{code}
Characters must not necessarily be printable; newlines or other control characters are also permitted. Unicode escapes work as everywhere else, but none of the escape sequences in (ï¿½1.3.6) is interpreted.
{code}
