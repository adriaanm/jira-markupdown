I've occasionally wanted this, and "Sophie" [recently asked|http://www.scala-lang.org/node/11941] on scala-user list if it was possible:

{quote}
{code}
case class Rectangle(height: Int, width: Int)
{code}
Instead of pattern matching by position:
{code}
       case Rectangle(_, w) => use(w)
{code}
 
Can I use the field label, something like:
{code}
       case Rectangle(width = w) => use(w)
{code}
{quote}

FWIW if I had the ability to set the priority to Minor, I would! :)
promoted back to major SI-6524 %)
SI-6524 is newer, but is more comprehensive and has more discussion and links, so I'll close this one.
