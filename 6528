My playing around with system properties has been unsuccessful and the issue persists. Could you at least add a scala-actors system property and modify the code in `TcpService.scala` (line 179) to call `setSoTimeout` if the property is set. The property could be called `scala.actors.tcpSocket.soTimeout`. I'd recommend adding options for the others as well
