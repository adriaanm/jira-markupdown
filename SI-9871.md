We have a class, `Service` which extends `Function1`, and another method, `Filter#andThen` which takes either a `Service` or a `Function1` as an argument.  With the scalac flag `-Xexperimental` set, we get "ambiguous overload".

Details and reproduction case here:

https://github.com/twitter/scrooge/issues/238
not completely sure it's relevant to your actual code, but I'd like to note it here, since it came up for me right away experimenting with implementing the English description ("We have a class...") above:

any time you have the {{Foo extends FunctionN}} pattern you may run into https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/138 which prevents even something as simple as:

{code:scala}
abstract class Service extends (Int => String)
(_.toString): Service
{code}

from compiling. (Noticed first by Lukas, https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5307#issuecomment-238858157)

Adriaan has a WIP patch at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5126 but its future is unclear (in any case, it won't make 2.12.0). making this compile makes other things _not_ compile (since new ambiguities are possible), so it's not clear-cut what to do.
[~sethtisue], we just tried the nightly build (2.12.1-371bc2c-nightly) but it still fails with the same error message.  You can try to reproduce it yourself in finagle-core.
Here's a minimized repro

{code}
abstract class MyFunction1[T, U] extends Function1[T, U]

object Test {
  def foo(x: Function1[Int, Int]) = ???
  def foo(x: MyFunction1[Int, Int]) = ???

  val myf: MyFunction1[Int, Int] = ???
  foo(myf)
}
{code}

{code}
16:14 ~/Projects/2121/sandbox (2.12.x)$ s
Test.scala:8: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method foo in object Test of type (x: MyFunction1[Int,Int])Nothing
and  method foo in object Test of type (x: Int => Int)Nothing
match argument types (MyFunction1[Int,Int])
  foo(myf)
  ^
{code}
We also noticed that the problem goes away if we add another abstract method, or if it's still a SAM but it doesn't extend Function1.

It seems like the problem arises only when it both extends Function1 *and* it's a SAM.
There's weird behavior exhibited by isAsSpecific in Infer.scala: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/ccfa36071f0623d64474f37b12d40a838aac1b4e/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Infer.scala#L808.

In particular, it thinks that:
{code}
isAsSpecific((x: Int => Int)Nothing, (x: MyFunction1[Int,Int])Nothing) = true
{code}

In order to check specificity, isAsSpecific calls isCompatible (https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/ccfa36071f0623d64474f37b12d40a838aac1b4e/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Infer.scala#L294) passing Int => Int and MyFunction1[Int, Int] as arguments to that method.

The isCompatible check succeeds because it falls through into the isCompatibleSam case. It thinks that Int => Int is compatible with MyFunction1[Int, Int]. 

After isCompatible returns true, isAsSpecific concludes that the overload with Int => Int is as specific as the overload with MyFunction1[Int, Int]. As a result, overload resolution fails with an ambiguity.

I think that isCompatible works incorrectly. Not every Int => Int is compatible with MyFunction1[Int, Int]. Only lambdas are compatible with that type. Am I correct in pointing this out, or that was done deliberately?
[~moors] I have implemented your @notASam idea in a compiler plugin: https://github.com/xeno-by/workaround9871.
[~moors] we ended up deleting the old method.  We didn't want to make open source users add a compiler plugin for the library.  With that said, this is a pretty painful migration step.  In 2.12, users will have essentially the same API as we exposed previously, but for 2.11 compatibility, we need to pretend that it doesn't exist.  It would be great if you could improve resolution so that you don't break backwards compatibility with 2.11 anymore.
