```Java
class O {
  class Y
  class U extends Y
  class A[-T] {def x(x: T) = 1}
  def foo[T >: U]: A[Y] forSome {type Y >: T} = new A[T]
  val g = foo
  g.x(new U)
  g.x(new Y) // <-- compiler error: found: O.this.Y required: T
}
```

Error requires some type T, however in this context there is no such type, so anyway this is a bug in description (but I think not only in description).
