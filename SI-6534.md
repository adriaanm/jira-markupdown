This is true of 2.10.0-RC1, which is not listed as a valid version.
```scala
scala> class Foo(val x: Int) extends AnyVal { override def hashCode = 1 }
<console>:7: error: redefinition of hashCode method. See SIP-15, criterion 4. is not allowed in value class
       class Foo(val x: Int) extends AnyVal { override def hashCode = 1 }
```

But if an override is inherited, we get two different wrong behaviors: in the case of equals, no error is issued and it is ignored.  In the case of hashCode, no error is issued and it is used.

```scala
scala> trait Foo extends Any { override def equals(x: Any) = false }
defined trait Foo

scala> class Bippy(val x: Int) extends AnyVal with Foo { }
defined class Bippy

scala> new Bippy(5) == new Bippy(5)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> trait Ding extends Any { override def hashCode = -1 }
defined trait Ding

scala> class Bip(val x: Int) extends AnyVal with Ding
defined class Bip

scala> new Bip(5) hashCode
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
res1: Int = -1
```
Sorry, but I think this is an over-reaction. Has anybody attempted to fix this? It seems not as the ticket is still unassigned.

This is a fairly easy diagnosis and fix: If you look at the generated code after post-erasure you see that an equals on a value class is replaced by the equals on the underlying object. The same optimization is not done for hashcode.

There are two possible fixes:

1) Do the == optimization only if equals is not overridden anywhere

2) Demand that universal traits may not implement equals and hashCode.

I would vote for 2), which should be really easy to implement. 

Thanks




We always judge language extensions by their impact on the complexity of the spec.

Can we make a list of all the ways in which we had to restrict value classes because of current implementation restrictions?

I agree it's not a decision we should take lightly, but I feel the burden is on the extension to prove it's worth it.

Also, implicit classes that **directly** extend AnyVal should be supported, but maybe anything beyond directly extending AnyVal should be considered experimental for now.
I'll start a thread on scala-internals to discuss this in detail.
