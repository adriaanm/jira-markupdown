Suggested changes:

 * `Constraints` should be a member of the companion object rather than the class, as there's no reason to tie constraint construction to a particular panel instance.

 * The `add` method should not be protected. That may have made sense if `GridBagPanel` is to be used only declaratively, but arguably this layout is too complex for that. Rather, it's a prime candidate for wrapping by some application-specific declarative framework, in which case the protection is just a pain.

 * The single mutating constraints object as used in the demo code is nasty. Ideally `Constraints` should be a case class with keyword arguments.
