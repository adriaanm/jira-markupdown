It is possible to produce this problem with the Scala REPL using {{-Yrepl-class-based}}. The key to triggering this problem seems to be having an anonymous class with at least two members. Included is a new sample file that can be used to exhibit this problem. Below is a session showing the behavior:

{noformat}

Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_74).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

This has been tested with Scala 2.11.8 and 2.11.7
Smaller reproduction: Fail.scala:

{code}
var X = new { 
  def x = Seq.empty[AnyRef].reduce((a,b) => a)
}
{code}

Script:

{code}
scala -nc -Yrepl-class-based
:load Fail.scala
val a = X
X = null
:load Fail.scala
X
:q
{code}

Right.  I forgot to include the information Iulian figured out.  The problem is the {{a}}.

If you update the script to:

{noformat}scala -nc -Yrepl-class-based
:load Fail.scala
val aaa = X
X = null
:load Fail.scala
X
:q
{noformat}

You'll see that {{X}} updates properly.

So, the {{a}} in the {{def x = Seq.empty\[AnyRef\].reduce((a,b) => a)}} and the top-level {{a}} in the REPL seems to trigger the problem.
Or
{code}
scala> var f: Int => Int = i => i
f: Int => Int = <function1>

scala> val i = f(10)
i: Int = 10

scala> f = null
f: Int => Int = null

scala> var f: Int => Int = i => i
f: Int => Int = <function1>

scala> f   // reports the first f, not its redefinition
res0: Int => Int = null
{code}

Both object and class templates (incorrectly or spuriously) import too much (both first f and i), but object template correctly imports the desired f, which hides the previous f.  The class template has different logic that fails to import the correct f at res0, so it resolves to the incorrect one.

Imports can require previous imports:

{code}
scala> trait T ; class C { implicit val t: T = new T {} }
defined trait T
defined class C

scala> val c = new C
c: C = C@77afea7d

scala> import c.t
import c.t

scala> implicitly[T]
res0: T = C$$anon$1@5442a311

scala> val t = 17
t: Int = 17

scala> t
res1: T = C$$anon$1@5442a311
{code}
