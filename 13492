I ran scalac A.scala with just a simple 

class A

and then try scalap A and I get this:
class/object A not found.

It seems to work with explicit - classpath option:

scalap -classpath . A
package A;
class A extends scala.AnyRef with scala.ScalaObject {
  def $$tag(): scala.Int;
  def this(): scala.Unit;
}

I also not sure why first line said "package A;"
