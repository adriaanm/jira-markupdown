There are actually two bugs, which may or may not be related. The first bug occurs when extening a java class with package protected memebers.
The second bug occurs when methods using package protected members get inlined (requires -optimise switch).

Java class:
{code}
package test;

class PackageProtected {
    int foo;
}
{code}

Scala:
{code}
package test

final class Test extends PackageProtected {
  def bar = foo
}

package another {
  object Main {
    def bug1(t: Test) {
      // Can always be replicated.
      println(t.foo)
    }
    def bug2(t: Test) {
      // Conditions to replicate: must use -optimise, class Test must be final
      println(t.bar)
      //@noinline is a usable workaround
    }
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
      bug1(new Test)
      bug2(new Test)
    }
  }
}
{code}

(In r22755) closes SI-3663. disregard package nesting for access check of java syms

namers wasn't setting privateWithin on java-defined variables (btw, shouldn't clone carry over privateWithin?)
better treatment of linked class access boundary (only check for access within linked class if it actually exists)

would have liked more control for the test case: only javac should compile the java file, then scalac should compile the scala file and fail
