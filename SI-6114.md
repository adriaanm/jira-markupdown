When you have two JListWrappers (or more commonly, two java.util.Lists implictly converted) and you call {{l1 ++ l2}}, as well as returning the concatenation it also modifies {{l1}}, adding the contents of {{l2}}. Couldn't find any mention in the docs that this might happen and no other collection classes do this so suspect it's a bug.

Sorry I couldn't put a proper test together but I reproduced it with this gist in 2.10.0-M5: https://gist.github.com/3149477
Doesn't even need to be two ListWrappers.  One and an ordinary Scala list does the same thing:

{code}
scala> val list = new java.util.ArrayList[Int]
list: java.util.ArrayList[Int] = []

scala> list.add(1)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> list.add(2)
res1: Boolean = true

scala> list.add(3)
res2: Boolean = true

scala> list
res3: java.util.ArrayList[Int] = [1, 2, 3]

scala> import scala.collection.JavaConverters._
import scala.collection.JavaConverters._

scala> list.asScala ++ List(4,5,6)
res4: scala.collection.mutable.Buffer[Int] = Buffer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

scala> list
res5: java.util.ArrayList[Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
{code}

I believe the bug is that {{BufferLike.++}} is implemented as "{{clone() ++= that}}" and {{JListWrapper}} doesn't override {{clone}}, so it's making a shallow copy, with the clone and the original sharing a reference to the same underlying {{ArrayList}}.
First, this seems to be a regression of 2.9, since 2.8's ++ had the currently implemented behavior.

Second, I have an idea, but it's fairly invasive, so I'd propose to discuss it on scala-internals if you're interested: in short, have some variant of a Cloneable[Coll] typeclass.

Most concrete members of the Java collections framework I've inspected up to now also implement the Cloneable interface - and cloning is shallow (that is, elements are not cloned), which is perfect.
Among others, ArrayList, LinkedList, EnumSet, HashSet, ArrayDeque, CopyOnWriteArrayList.

ConcurrentHashMap and ConcurrentLinkedQueue are notable exceptions and can be cloned only via their constructors, but ConcurrentSkipList* are Cloneable.

Ignoring API stability constraints, a first idea would be exposing the implicit conversion on {{Collection\[T\] with Cloneable}}. This conversion should have higher priority than the existing one, and could be prioritized otherwise; the old conversion could even be deprecated.
More flexibly, one could have a {{Cloneable\[Coll\]}} typeclass (maybe with a different name), with the new conversion taking an instance, with a default instance for subtypes of java.lang.Cloneable, and other default instances for List, Map and Set. Collection seems to call for {{Cloneable\[-FromColl, +ToColl\]}} and different non-default instances.

Third, I would say, it's even less clear whether implicit conversions are appropriate (I just verified that this problem affects also {{WrapAsScala}}, which up to now was considered to be safe to use.
In particolar, {{a ++ b}} could silently copy the whole collection a as a different kind of collection, after {{import WrapAsScala._}}.
At least, there should be IMHO a clear warning in the ScalaDocs. I think the problem is mostly about {{++}} being available on mutable collections, but I assume that unfortunately this couldn't be changed.
Ok, after investigation, This is what I discovered:

Java only exposes clone (publicly) for specific collections.  You have to *know* the specific type to clone.  That's just not happening in our interface, so I went with my initial idea for cloning, added some tests for basic Set/Map/Collection/List.  Now, Collection doesn't expose clone either, so we may be ok here.

In any case, I'm opening a bigger ticket on clone behavior in collections as a whole.   I need to do more thorough cleanup work across collections and I think it'll fix these issues.
