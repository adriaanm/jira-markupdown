What I was 'up to' was writing an app to demo a library I've written, that's based on scala.swing; this I hope to make available shortly.

Okay, but I still think the Component should be publishing the event, since it is the Component which is given as the event's source:

{code}
case class SelectionChanged(override val source: Component) extends ComponentEvent with SelectionEvent
{code}
