Low-level safety checks
Null checks are cheap. They usually fold straight into a related memory access instruction, and use the CPU bus logic to catch nulls. (Deoptimization follows, with regenerated code containing an explicit check.)
User-written null checks are in most cases functionally identical to those inserted by the JVM.
Null checks can be hoisted manually, and suppress implicit null checks in dominated blocks.
Similar points can be made about other simple predicates, like class checks and range checks.
All such checks, whether implicit or manually written, are aggressively folded to constants.
