I _think_ that there might still be at least one error message that goes to STDOUT rather than STDERR:
{code}
394	    if (!f.isFile) {
395	      Console.println("no such file: " + scriptFile)
{code}

I'm sorry if I'm wrongly reopening this ticket, but if I'm not, I would suggest looking for any other println:s that could be turned into err.println.
