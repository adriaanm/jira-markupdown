Someone changed dropWhile (I don't think it was me) in the boxed arrays to return an array projection and forgot to update the Array class to return a projection rather than an array!

Code:
```scala
object Test {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    val z : Array[Byte] = new Array[Byte](0)
    Console.println("hello world" + " " + z.getClass)
    Console.println("hello world" + " " + z.dropWhile(_ == 0x00).getClass)
    ()
  }
}
```

Just change dropWhile/takeWhile in Array.scala to return array projections rather than arrays and I think everything will be OK.
