I just noticed that the following somewhat further reduced example produces the same unexpected behaviour:

{code:scala}
val input = scala.io.Source.stdin.getLines
input.sliding(2).foreach(println)
{code}

Which leads me to think it's not something related to Streams so I should probably update the title.
