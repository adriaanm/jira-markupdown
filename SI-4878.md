Don't know if this qualifies as opaque enough, and I also don't know if there is something you can do about it. Anyway, sometimes I forget the "def" when writing an auxiliary constructor:

```scala
scala> class Eg(name: String) {
     |  this() = this("DEFAULT")
     | }
<console>:8: error: value update is not a member of Eg
        this() = this("DEFAULT")
        ^
```

(I now immediately recognise the problem and simply add the missing "def", but the first few times, I found the error message a tiny bit cryptic.)

That is potentially legal code. I don't see an easy way to help out for this one.

```scala
scala> class A(a: Int) { this() = this(0); def update(i: Any) {}; def apply(a: Int) = ()}
defined class A
```
