I have produced a patch for this, taking advantage of some methods used for `del`, which have now been moved outside that method, and an algorithm I devised for appending trees of arbitrary depth differences. I've tested this with a scalacheck suite of tests, also attached.

Since I have worked on this patch on a cloned github repo, I have also made a pull request there for the patch, in the change that that's easier.
