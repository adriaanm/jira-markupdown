java.lang.ref.PhantomReference.get() always returns null. The only use of a PhantomReference is resource cleanup. To do this they are subclassed with the required information to do the cleanup. Once the referenced object can be GCed the PhantomReference object will be queued. The ReferenceQueue.poll() method will return all queues java.lang.ref.Reference subclasses. And because all reference classes in scala.ref._ wrap the corresponding Java.lang.ref.* class instead of subclassing it, you can't get the Scala object back from a ReferenceQueue.

The attached Cleaner is a useful utility to cleanup things like OpenGL textures etc. It can't be implemented with scala.ref.PhantomReference because of the above issue.

It would be nice if this Cleaner can be included in scala.ref
In the meanwhile the above fix has been improved, see the following mail to the Scala mailing list:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala/18833/

See also the discussion for ticket #2854.

Therefore, I close this ticket now.
