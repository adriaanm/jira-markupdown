As I reported [http://code.google.com/p/collaborative-scaladoc/issues/detail?id=15 here], comments merged from CollaDoc use slightly different comment formatting:

Scala library:
```scala
/**
 *  Text
 */
```

CollaDoc: 
```scala
/**
  * Text line 1
  * Text line 2 */
```

This introduces noice in the change sets and potential merge problems if documentation is changed directly in the source code.

Is there a concensus which format to follow? I think it would be advisable to use the format as it was and don't change it now.
