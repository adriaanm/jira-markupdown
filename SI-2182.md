The following code is problematic:

```scala
abstract sealed class FinalResult[X]
case class Error(msg:String) extends FinalResult[Nothing]
case class Success[U](value:U) extends FinalResult[U]

class A {
    protected sealed abstract class BaseResult[X]    
    protected case class Result[X](result:X) extends BaseResult[X]
    protected case class NoResult(msg:String) extends BaseResult[Nothing]
        
    protected abstract class B[U] {              
        protected def get:BaseResult[U]
        def apply:FinalResult[U] = {
            get match {
              case r:NoResult => Error(r.msg)
              case r:Result[U] => Success(r.result)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

It compiles, but with a warning about type erasure at line

case r:Result[U] => Success(r.result)

However, there doesn't seem to be any way to get rid properly of that warning except by writting

case r:Result[_] => Success(r.result.asInstanceOf[U])

which is long to write and involves an unrequired cast even though we are ensured that r.result cannot be anything but type U.

This is basically a duplicate of #884 - I've added a pointer from there to here for completeness.
Interestingly this was not really a duplicate of #884.  Instead it was something which worked all along.  Your real issue was a lack of variance in FinalResult and BaseResult.  Yes, I'm aware I closed this 15 months ago and am talking to myself.
@extempore thanks for responding. Next time could you add a comment instead of editing mine? :D
I've hit this issue myself. Would you perhaps be so kind as to expand the fix? "Your real issue was a lack of variance in FinalResult and BaseResult" -- do you mean if they were covariant this would work? What does variance have to do with the issue, I don't see any subtype or supertype of X anywhere.
@Paul Phillips it was obvious, don't worry. :)

(speaking of JIRA UX, I'm trying to figure out the right way to "mention" someone...)

As for the explanation, I see what you mean now. I was too focused on the next line, `case r:Result[U] => Success(r.result)`.

Indeed, this does compile:

```scala
case class C[A](a: A, modify: A => A)
def test[A](c: C[A]): C[A] = c match { case C(x, f) => C(f(x), f) } 
```
