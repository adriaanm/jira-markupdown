When I try to compile the following file:

```scala
package com.sun.test

import java.util.Date
```

I get the error message
```scala
comsuntest.scala:3: error: Date is not a member of java.util
import java.util.Date
       ^
one error found
```

It should be possible to be able to write new code in com.sun packages, Sun employees do use Scala too :-)
I assume there's a java subpackage somewhere on the com.sun path which shadows the root java. You need to address the root java package explicitly writing
```scala
 _root_.java.util
```
