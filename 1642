Code highlighting does not work in the new (beta preview) 2.8 eclipse plugin (2.8.0.r20737-b20100131044631).

Only scala keywords are highlighted (def, class, extends, import, ect.) but they do not seem to follow the preference page. All other forms of highlighting are not working.

Also when I first open the Scala preference page for the Scala Editor, all the text is in white and buttons and check boxes are behind the list of highlighting categories (that are also in white). If I close the preference window and reopen it, I can see the correct settings for highlighting and the buttons and check boxes are in place, but the "apply" button does nothing to the Scala editors (even if I close and re-open them).

There is no exception in the log file or no special error in the Error Log view. The plugin seems to work well for compilation, completion, etc., only the highlighting does not work.

The 2.7.x plugin worked well.

This does not work for already existing projects (files compile well with scalac on the terminal), but also if I try to create a new project.

The eclipse version is Galileo, build-id is 20090920-1017. I tried a fresh install of eclipse Galileo SR1 with no other plugin installed, in a new workspace, and the problem remains. JDK is OpenJDK 1.6.0 on Ubuntu 9.10, 64bits.
