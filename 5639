The immediate issue is a duplicate of scala/bug#3687.  I understand the general concern about Enumeration, but this should be discussed on the mailing lists.  This subject has been discussed before, so you are most likely to succeed by understanding those discussions and giving concrete proposals.  (I am not the final authority here- these are suggestions.)
