```scala
Seq(1,2,3).view.slice(2,3).apply(-1)   // Gives 2
Array(1,2,3).view.slice(2,3).update(-1,0)  // Replaces 2 with 0
Stream(1,2,3).view.slice(2,3).apply(-1)  // Gives 2
```
The principle of least surprise would indicate that you can't index out of your slice.  Also, this prevents views from actually restricting access to a portion of a mutable collection since you can index before.  Note that indexing off the end of the slice is not permitted.
