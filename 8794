This problem goes far beyond macros; you can break a hundred things with an identifier named "scala". In the distant past I tried to alleviate this somewhat, and for reasons I never figured out you can't universally use _root_.scala as a remedy. (And not because _root_ is a valid identifier, though obviously that is a problem as well.)
