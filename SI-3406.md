> (1 to 100000000).hashCode 

takes several seconds on a i7 920 which kind of breaks the hashCode contract that states hashCode should be fast.
Hi, 

I've done some information finding on this bug, first by compiling the snippet with the compiler options 

{code}
-Xprint:icode -Xprint-icode
{code}

which allows seeing almost-bytecode-level what gets done: 

 {code}
  1: 
    26	LOAD_MODULE object Predef
    26	LOAD_MODULE object Predef
    26	CONSTANT (Constant(1))
    26	CALL_METHOD scala.Predefscala.Predef.intWrapper (dynamic)
    26	CONSTANT (Constant(100000000))
    26	CALL_METHOD scala.runtime.RichIntscala.runtime.RichInt.to (dynamic)
    26	CALL_METHOD scala.collection.immutable.Range$$Inclusivescala.collection.SeqLike.hashCode (dynamic)
    26	BOX INT
    26	CALL_METHOD scala.Predefscala.Predef.println (dynamic)
    26	RETURN (UNIT)
{code}

First a RichInt is built for the "1", and then method RichInt.to is invoked on it with 100000000 as argument. That returns a Range (this and other sources at 

http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/runtime/RichInt.scala

) and finally the implementation of hashCode defined in SeqLike gets run, i.e. 

{code}
  /** Hashcodes for $$Coll produce a value from the hashcodes of all the
   *  elements of the $$coll.
   */
  override def hashCode() = (Seq.hashSeed /: this)(_ * 41 + _.hashCode)
{code}


Thus explaining why it's slow. Actually long ago there used to be a custom hashCode implementation in Range, but: 


{code}
  /* eliminated, so as to not break the hashcode/equals contract 
  override def hashCode = start + limit + step
  */
{code}


The short answer is, hashCode will be slow on large sequences. 



So, one just needs an explicit form of computing the hashcode of a sequence of consecutive numbers. As far as I can see the formula for (min to max).hashCode is:
{code}
(...((Seq.hashCode * 41 + min.hashCode) * 41 + (min + 1).hashCode) * 41 + ...) * 41 + max.hashCode
{code}
which is
{code}
Seq.hashCode * Math.pow(41, max - min + 1) + (min to max).map(i => i * Math.pow(41, max - min - i)).sum
{code}
Which essentially boils down to the problem, if there is a form of
{code}
(1 to n).map(i => i * Math.pow(41, n - i)).sum
{code}
without any form of loop like map, fold, or sum.
But my math ends here.

I did a quick test. A simple imperative style loop
{code}
{ var x = 0; for (i <- 1 to 100000000) x = x * 41 + i; x}
{code}
is much faster, but still takes about one second to compute.
I noticed that the hashCode of sets is much simpler.
SetLike.hashCode is just
{code}
this map (_.hashCode) sum
{code}
If Seqs also had this (or a similar) formula for their hash codes, a fast implementation for Range would be easy. Is it possible to change the implementation for SeqLike.hashCode?

Which brings up a bigger question: Is the implementation of SeqLike.hashCode part of the public API of SeqLike?
Here's a closed formula: (pow(k,(n+1)) + n - k (n+1))/pow(k-1, 2)

k would be 41 in this case, n the end of the range.


That formula can be made to work for 32 bit ints.  The only difficulty is dividing by pow(k-1,2) = 64 * 25.  The problem of dividing by 64 can be solved by using longs for intermediate results.  The inverse of 25 mod 2**32 is -1030792151.  So a much faster way of computing {{ (0 /: (1 to n)) (_ * 41 + _) }} is:

{code}
	def power(x : Long, power : Long) = {
		var ans = 1L
		var xp = x
		var p = power
		while(p > 0) {
			if((p&1L)!=0) {
				ans *= xp
			}
			p >>= 1
			xp *= xp
		}
		ans
	}

	def rangeHashCode(n : Int) = {
		val numerator = power(41L,n+1L) + n - 41L * (n+1L)
		(numerator / 64).toInt * (-1030792151) 
	}
{code}

This can of course be generalized to arbitrary start, limit, and step, but I don't remember the formula offhand.
