The following code causes a compilation error:

{code}
object Foo {                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  def foo(x: Int, y: Int = 10) = x*y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  lazy val y = foo(x = 20)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
}
{code}

The error is as follows:

{code}
innocuous.scala:3: error: variable definition needs type because 'y' is used as a named argument in its body.
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
  lazy val y = foo(x = 20)
           ^
one error found
{code}

None of the following fail in the same way:

{code}
val y = foo(x = 20)
{code}

OR

{code}
lazy val y = foo(20)
{code}

It appears that combining the {{lazy}} modifier on {{y}} with a named arg in the application of {{foo}} causes it to blow up.
