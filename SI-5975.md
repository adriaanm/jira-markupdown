This test demonstrates how the Presentation Compiler can end up in a stale
state. In a nutshell, by loading and typechecking first [A.scala|https://github.com/dotta/scala/blob/topic/presentation-compiler-reports-wrong-error/test/files/presentation/ide-t1000976/src/a/A.scala], and then
[B.scala|https://github.com/dotta/scala/blob/topic/presentation-compiler-reports-wrong-error/test/files/presentation/ide-t1000976/src/b/B.scala], the following compilation error is reported in ``B`` compilation unit:

{noformat}
not enough arguments for constructor C: (key: String, componentStates: String)c.C
{noformat}
The default arguments in C (and potentially also the implicit conversion in A) seem to be playing a part.

The code for testing this problem is currently sitting in my own fork: 

https://github.com/dotta/scala/tree/topic/presentation-compiler-reports-wrong-error

Let me know if I should open a pull-request against master right away, or wait until a fix is ready (though, the fix and the test code should ideally be part of the same pull request in the end). 

We also have a related ticket in the Scala IDE issue tracker: http://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/support/tickets/1000976.
