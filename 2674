There seem to be two problems going on here.  Iulian, can you have a look at problem scala/bug#2:

If I change the result type of newInner to Outer[X].Inner (to get around problem SI-1: we don't detect we need to generate a javasig when the result type refers to an instantiation of a generic inner class(??)), I get (compiling with -Ydebug -verbose):

{{
Java sig of method newInner is ()LOuter<LX;>.Inner;
add generic sig method newInner:()<empty>.this.Outer[<empty>.this.X]#Inner ==> ()LOuter<LX;>.Inner; @ 24
...
add generic sig class OuterImpl:<empty>.this.Outer[<empty>.this.X] with scala.this.ScalaObject{<method> def this(<param> x: <empty>.this.X): <empty>.this.OuterImpl; <method> def newInner(): <empty>.this.Outer[<empty>.this.X]#Inner} ==> LOuter<LX;>;Lscala/ScalaObject; @ 26
[wrote classes/OuterImpl.class]
```scala

javap says
```
lampmac6:tmp adriaan$$ javap -classpath classes -v -s OuterImpl
Compiled from "x.scala"
...
const scala/bug#23 = Method	scala/bug#20.scala/bug#22;	//  Outer$$Inner."<init>":(LOuter;)V
const scala/bug#24 = Asciz	()LOuter<LX;>.Inner;;
const scala/bug#25 = Asciz	Signature;
const scala/bug#26 = Asciz	LOuter<LX;>;Lscala/ScalaObject;;

...

public Outer$$Inner newInner();
  Signature: ()LOuter$$Inner;
{code}

Note that the signature does not use the (expected?) const scala/bug#24. It's clearly computed as you can see in the log, but somehow the method does not get the javasig attribute thingy (I don't really know how this works in bytecode)
