Thanks for the heads up! I was just writing a duplicate bug report of scala/bug#2764.

If the Java annotation, Java enum and the Scala class are in the same project then we get the compiler bug and Eclipse correctly reports this error in both the editor and the problems view (Eclipse does not know that the compiler has a bug).

In the case that I wrote in my comment the code compiles and runs so the error is bogus since compilation completed successfully. The problem with Eclipse here is that an error that produced during compilation and was later (during compilation) removed is shown in the Scala editor.
