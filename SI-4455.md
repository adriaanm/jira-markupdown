Currently the toggle arrows in Scaladoc are shown when there is a shortcomment for the member. This is not correct. Instead they should be shown whenever there is a fullcomment.

I created a patch for template.js that fixes this. Also I cleaned it up just a little.
(In r24711) [scaladoc] Don't generate long comments if they are the same as the short comment. Closes SI-4455. No review.
