Just ran into this in a real-life example writing a unit test using Mockito:
```java
        when(serviceReference.getProperty("name")).thenReturn(name)
```

Results in the compilation error:
```scala
scala: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method thenReturn in trait OngoingStubbing of type (x$1: Object, x$2: <repeated...>[Object])org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing[Object]
and  method thenReturn in trait OngoingStubbing of type (x$1: Object)org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing[Object]
match argument types (String)
        when(serviceReference.getProperty("name")).thenReturn(name)
                                                   ^
```

And to fix this, I have to be explicit in typing the instance of OngoingStubbing:
```java
        when(serviceReference.getProperty("name")).asInstanceOf[OngoingStubbing[String]].thenReturn(name)
```

Which can get pretty ridiculous, depending on the thing I'm stubbing:
```java
        when(bundleContext.getService(serviceReference)).asInstanceOf[OngoingStubbing[LoginHandler[AuthData, User, String]]].thenReturn(handler)
```

It's not Friday yet, but I guess it is time to get beer and/or pray.
