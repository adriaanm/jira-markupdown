That depends on the point of view.  For the compiler developer the "actual issue" might be something different than for the user.  My issue is not that I have to rewrite my code but that I have to spend 2 hours to find out what might be going wrong with the build and which change caused the problem (of course I first think that it's MY fault) and that I have to explain to my team that Scala is a good choice although the compiler crashes without giving a message.  The "actual issue" is not a problem at all because there's an easy workaround. (Replace "C().CC()" with "val c = C(); c.CC()")

My suggestion is to "fix" the problem by giving a helpful message to the user (such as: known bug in the compiler, see issue scala/bug#4859 for suggested workaround"). That shouldn't be much work in the compiler but can save users time and gives a much better impression.  Of course a "real fix" would be better but I'd prefer an earlier release with a message that improves the user experience.
