I tried to fix that in r20487 by accepting only non-local members as visible for imports. However, this breaks the interpreter, which seemingly imports local members of $$iw objects. I could not figure out where so I reassign to you, Paul. To reproduce, you need to have a look at the change in Namers in r20487. It contains an alternative implementation of checkSelectors, which causes jvm/interpreter.scala to fail.
