This turned out to be due to concurrent access to the name table by the presentation compiler.

As a temporary solution we will synchronize `newTerm/TypeName` in the IDE. This should provide enough protection for names, and I think that's the root cause here.

I'll also prepare a PR for 2.11 to move this in the presentation compiler (interactive.Global). At least the parser (that is meant to be thread-safe) is creating names, so the presentation compiler should account for that.
