But this JAVA-code works (of course):
{code}

	public void stuff() {
		Fisk.A a = new Fisk.A();
		Fisk.A b = Fisk.A;
		int i = Fisk.A.bar;
		Fisk.A.foo();
		b.foo();
		i = b.bar;
	}
{code}

This strikes me as strange as Scala is supposed to be, at least to my knowledge, 100% compatible with JAVA, but surely isn't as we've demonstrated here.

Is this something you Scala-guys will take a note of and plan to address, or will it end up on the infamous incompatibility-list?
