The class is deprecated.
The relevant part of the documentation looks like this:
```scala
Annotations    @deprecated( message = ... ) 
Source         Cell.scala
Deprecated     use scala.Option or scala.Some instead
Version        1.0, 08/08/2003 
```

A method is deprecated.
The relevant part of the documentation looks like this:
```scala
Annotations    @deprecated( message = "use p
Definition Classes
    ProductroductIterator instead" ) 
Deprecated     use productIterator instead
```

= enhancement recommendation =

In both cases it may be OK to have both an individual entry "Deprecated" and "@deprecated" listed in "Annotations", duplicating the deprecation message (or displaying "..." which is even more useless") should be avoided.

Ideally, "@deprecated" should be shown without parens, message or ellipsis and the deprecation message should be shown in the separate "Deprecation" entry like it currently does.
(In r24788) Shows deprecation message only once. Contributed by Simon Ochsenreither (soc). Closes #4466. Review by malayeri.
