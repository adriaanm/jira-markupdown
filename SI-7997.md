Member vars and vals appears in scope completion results, even if they are shadowed by local vars or vals.

The following presentation compiler partest
```scala
package test

class Completion2 {

  val v1 = 0
  var r1 = 1
  def f1 = 2
  type t1 = Int

  def foo {

    // local declarations shadow imported members
    val v1 = "a"
    var r1 = "b"
    def f1 = "c"
    type t1 = String

    /*_*/

  }

}
```
generates this output
```plain
reload: Completion.scala, Test.scala

askScopeCompletion at Completion.scala(18,4)

```

`v1` and `r1` are listed twice, once for the local variables, once for the class members. `f1` and `t1` correctly appear only once.

The problem is in the `Members.addNonShadowed()` method. It checks for duplicated names, but doesn't handle the fact that members vars and vals contains an extra `space` in their name.
