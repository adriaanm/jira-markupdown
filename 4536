My use-case is very 'real world,,tm,,' :)

I'm implementing a Spring 3.0 type converter, allowing me to inject lists/maps/etc into classes using Scala collection types (see http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/validation.html#core-convert)

Although I can achieve this by explicitly referencing the conversion method by name, I really want to use implicit resolution here, i.e.
`implicitly[ju.Dictionary[Int, String] => mutable.Map[Int, String]]`

Which would allow me to abstract the exact conversion mechanism, perhaps using scalaj instead.
