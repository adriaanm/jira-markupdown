I'm afraid that you really are out of heap ... 2GB is only just barely sufficient for running two instance of Eclipse with the Scala plugin and doing any useful work.

However, it should be possible with some changes to you Eclipse vmargs. Try adding,

{code}
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
-vmargs
-Xms256m
-Xmx1024m
-XX:PermSize=64m
-Xss1M
-server
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
{code}

to your main config.ini and the equivalent to your launch configuration for the child Eclipse application (ie. in the vmargs section of the launch configuration dialog).
