I'm developing a framework for writing mock classes.  The center of this is a class MethodMocker[ArgList, Return].  So, I might have MethodMocker[Tuple3[String, String, Int], String] for a method foo(x: String, y: String, z: Int): String.

For a method with no arguments, bar(), I can do MethodMocker[Unit, ... ].

To mock a method one one argument, such as snafu(p: String): Int, I can get away with MethodMocker[String, Int].

However, consistency would make it much easier for framework users if they could consistently say TupleX.  Aside from the ease of use issue, I'm having to do special processing when the ArgList is turn into a string as part of a method call, because the one argument case does not include parentheses on the as TupleX and Unit both do.
