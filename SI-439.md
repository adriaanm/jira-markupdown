Presently, it is only possible to refer to the object itself using "this".  For symmetry and aesthetic reasons it would be useful to be able to include a self name in refinements.  Something like
```scala
X1 with ... with Xn { self => ... }
```
I am not sure yet whether it also makes sense to allow an annotation on the self name as is possible in other contexts.

For example, the following is presently allowed:
```scala
val x : { val y : this.type } = new { val y : this.type = this }
```
but the following is not
```scala
val x : { self => val y : self.type } = new { self => val y : self.type = self }
```
Based on this interpreter session I'm closing this ticket.
```scala
scala> trait A ; trait B
defined trait A
defined trait B

scala> new A with B { self: A => def whatami() = self }
res3: $$anon forSome { type $$anon <: java.lang.Object with A with B{def whatami(): $$anon with A} } = $$anon$$1@720d22

scala> res3.whatami
res4: $$anon with A = $$anon$$1@720d22

scala> new A with B { self: B => def whatami() = self }
res5: $$anon forSome { type $$anon <: java.lang.Object with A with B{def whatami(): $$anon with B} } = $$anon$$1@7a80dc
```

Wrong kind of refinement.
