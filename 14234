```scala
class A {
  protected def x = 0
  protected[A] def y = 0
}

class B extends A {
  override def x = 1
  println(super[A].y)
  override def y = 1
}
```

gives the following compile error:
```scala
P.scala:9: error: method y overrides nothing
  override def y = 1
               ^
one error found
```

This is either a misleading error message, since A.y is definitely visible in B or as I think a plain error. Section 5.1.4 of the spec doesn't disallow this.

The same applies for qualified private members as in:
```scala
class A {
  class B {
    private[A] def x = 0
  }

  class C extends B {
    override def x = 1
  }
}
```
