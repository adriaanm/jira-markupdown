The following program throws an Assertion Error on compilation (both with 2.7.0-final and with 2.7.1.RC1). 
```scala
object Crash {
    class Zero
    class Succ[T]
    
    type mul[m[n[s[_], z], z], n[s[_], z], s[_], z] = m[n, z]
    type _1[s[_], z] = s[z]
    type p = mul[_1, _1, Succ, Zero] 
}
```
