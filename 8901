It looks like the `div` ({{"#content"}}) that wraps the `iframe` needs to have: 
```javascript
overflow: auto;
-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
```

to enable scrolling on iOS; I tried this out using Safari's iOS developer tools, and after setting the properties I was able to scroll the main content on the iPad.
