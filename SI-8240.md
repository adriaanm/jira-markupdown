I found that using specialized code rather than:

  `List#{map, collect, nonEmpty, isEmpty}`

gave small but measurable performance wins the compiler on hot paths.

Hypothoses: 

  - calling nonEmpty incurs a megamorphic cost that JIT can't inline its way around.
  - allocating a ListBuffer when mapping over an already empty list is wasteful

We should see if we could reproduce these results in a compiler-free microbenchmark of collections and roll the improvements back.

Care must be taken when introducing overloads in List that we don't go backwards in call sites that oscilate between a variety of collections (in the compiler we almost always use List).
`eq Nil` doesn't work very well, but avoiding the generic `List.ReusableCBF` for building in `map` is an amazing boost, 5x or so.  No evidence of megamorphism penalty in mixed cases.  (Probably because we already have that penalty from List.ReusableCBF vs other ReusableCBFs.)

We can define `isEmpty`, `nonEmpty` as:

class List[T] {
  override final def isEmpty = this eq Nil
  override final def nonEmpty = this ne Nil
}
