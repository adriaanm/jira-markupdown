This seems related to scala/bug#2425. I'm guessing they both unexpectedly fail the subtyping test in adapt around line 942:
```scala
          if (tree1.tpe <:< pt) adapt(tree1, mode, pt, original)
```

I would say that the following should hold:
```scala
p.baz.type <:< Test.Bar#baz.type
```

since `p : Test.Bar`

Similarly, in scala/bug#2425, somehow, `Boolean` seems not to be a subtype of `java.lang.Object`
