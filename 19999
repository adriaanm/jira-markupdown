Today I ran into a strange issue where lazy vals in a private def would be null. I managed to contruct a minimal example where this happens:
```
object O {
  private def f[T](g: => T): T = ???
  private def h(n: Int = 0): Int =
    if (n > 5) 0
    else {
      lazy val x = 1
      println(x)

      if (x > -1) h(n + 1)
      else f(h(n + 1))
    }
  def z(): Int = h()
}
O.z()
```

Expected output: 1 1 1 1 1
Actual output: 1 0 0 0 0

This happens with both scala 2.11.6 and 2.11.7.
