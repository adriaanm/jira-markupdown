The following demonstrates a method which is inlined until its class is specialized, after which it isn't, because the specialized version of the (declared final) method is not final.  As a debugging aid, the specialized one is inlined if the call site is in a constructor, just not if it's in the body of a regular method.

```scala
class C[U]() {
  @inline final def apply(x: U): U = x
}

class C2[@specialized(Boolean) U]() {
  @inline final def apply(x: U): U = x
}

class B {
  private val cNormal = new C[Boolean]()
  private val cSpec   = new C2[Boolean]()
  
  final def m1 = cNormal(true)
  final def m2 = cSpec(true)
  // ./a.scala:14: warning: Could not inline required method apply$mcZ$sp because it can be overridden.
  //   final def m2 = cSpec(true)
  //                       ^
  // one warning found

  // however, here it inlines
  cNormal(true)
  cSpec(true)
}
```
And on top of this, attempting to compile the same file a second time (that is, with class files present) crashes.  See #5006.
Assigning to meeting because I think that a) one of the few classes I would specialize with no reservations is Option and b) we cannot even consider specializing Option unless this is fixed, because we would be gifted with hundreds of getOrElse closure objects which are presently eliminated.
Because of the way specialized classes (e.g. C2$mcZ$sp) subclass the parent (e.g. C2) C2's methods obviously can't be final (IIRC "final" is removed during "specialize"). But the compiler could remember which methods **were** marked final/@inline and mark the specialized subclass's methods appropriately.

By itself this wouldn't fix your issue with Option. But using AnyRef specialization we can ensure that all uses of C2 will be rerouted to a specialized subclass (whose methods would correctly be final). I think this would fix this bug with regards to Option, although it wouldn't fix it in general. To fix it in general (IMO) would require always using AnyRef specialization (which seems like an OK plan to me) or to do a bigger change to how specialization works (maybe too big).

Am I missing something? What do you think?
Glad you were skeptical of my boneheadedness Paul!

I have a new patch which is less-completely-broken. It should fix the handling of final/@inline (i.e. letting classes like C2$mcZ$sp keep final on apply and apply$mcZ$sp) as well as removing @inline when removing final (to prevent annoying warnings).

Unfortunately, there are two other things that your example hits:

1. The inferred type of your lazy vals and defs is "C2" which means that ultimately the call will be "C2.apply$mcZ$sp" which still cannot be final/@inline (because it's in C2 and not C2$mcZ$sp). I'm not sure how feasible it is to "re-type" methods/vals whose type is a specialized class.

2. Even if you try doing new C2[Bool]()(true), which does correctly call C2$mcZ$sp.apply$mcZ$sp(true), it doesn't get inlined. Not sure why.

Anyway, I think the patch should be ok, but didn't want you to think that I had "fixed" this whole issue. What do you see as the scope of #5005 anyway? It encompasses (at least) 3 separate bugs in specialization, IMO.
In the example above no inlining will take place, even after adding inline and final flags to specialized members for two reasons:
 - as Erik pointed out, the inferred type for the accessor is {{C2\[Boolean\]}} (instead of {{C2$mcZ$sp}}) + accessor is not final and not inlined => intra-procedural TFA will infer {{C2\[Boolean\]}} for the stack slot
 - the inliner doesn't consider the constructor basic blocks as possible inlining targets (that's the actual reason there's no message for the {{cNormal(true)}} and {{cSpec(true)}})

A test case one could use here is:
```scala
class C2[@specialized(Boolean) U]() {
  @inline final def apply(x: U): U = x
}

class B {
  (new C2[Boolean]())(true)
}
```
Related: I'm working on a revamped type-flow analysis to track exact types as resulting from `new`. With that, a (future) version of Inliner could determine additional target methods, even if not marked final. Here's that work in progress:

https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/master...SinglePassTFA

Is this issue being worked on? I just hit this issue while trying to inline collection operations. I have another example where specialization doesn't work with inlining:
```scala
class SimpleCol[A](x: A) {
  @inline
  final def filter(p: A => Boolean): SimpleCol[A] = if (p(x)) this else null
  def isEmpty: Boolean = ???
}

class A(xs: SimpleCol[A], val a: Int) {
  @inline
  final def filter(p: A => Boolean): A =
    if (!xs.filter(p).isEmpty) this else
    if (p(this)) this
    else null

  def foo() = filter(x => x.a > 0)
}
```

I you compile it with `-no-specialization` then everything will get inlined into `foo` and closure will get eliminated. Otherwise the `p(this)` will remain (it's specialized apply) not inlined and the whole closure allocation is not eliminated.

For the snippet in [comment-58618 | https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5005?focusedCommentId=58618&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-58618] , the following non-inlined callsite keeps the closure alive (ie instantiated)

```
  5: pred: List(13) succs: List(8, 7) flags: <closed>
    17	LOAD_LOCAL(field p1)
    17	THIS(Object)
    17	CALL_METHOD scala.Function1.apply$mcZL$sp (dynamic)
    17	CZJUMP (BOOL)NE ? 7 : 8
```


using `-Ydebug -Ylog:inliner` to get more detailed log output. 

In turn, the following suggests no ICode is loaded for that closure method (although type-flow gets right the most specific type of the closure, `A$$anonfun$foo$1` , and thus could load bytecode for it)

```
[log inliner] shouldLoadImplFor: anonymous class A$$anonfun$foo$1.method apply$mcZL$sp: false
[log inliner] Treating CALL_METHOD scala.Function1.apply$mcZL$sp (dynamic)
	receiver: anonymous class A$$anonfun$foo$1
	icodes.available: false
	concreteMethod.isEffectivelyFinal: false
```

The condition that fails for loading said ICode is `sym.isEffectivelyFinal` below:

```
    /** Should method 'sym' being called in 'receiver' be loaded from disk? */
    def shouldLoadImplFor(sym: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Boolean = {
      def alwaysLoad    = (receiver.enclosingPackage == RuntimePackage) || (receiver == PredefModule.moduleClass)
      def loadCondition = sym.isEffectivelyFinal && isMonadicMethod(sym) && isHigherOrderMethod(sym)

      val res = hasInline(sym) || alwaysLoad || loadCondition
      debuglog("shouldLoadImplFor: " + receiver + "." + sym + ": " + res)
      res
    }
```

To recap, for inlining of an specialized apply method to happen, it's a necessary condition that `shouldLoadImplFor` succeeds for that method's symbol, and currently it doesn't because `sym.isEffectivelyFinal` is `false`.

More background info, this time from `javap`. There's no override in `A$$anonfun$foo$1` for `apply$mcZL$sp`:

```
public final class A$$anonfun$foo$1 extends scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1$mcZL$sp implements scala.Serializable{
    public static final long serialVersionUID;
    public static {};
    public final boolean apply(A);
    public final java.lang.Object apply(java.lang.Object);
    public final boolean apply(java.lang.Object);
    public A$$anonfun$foo$1(A);
}
```
For argument's sake, let's say the decision had been made instead to load ICode for `A$$anonfun$foo$1.apply$mcZL$sp`. The following shows the implementation `A$$anonfun$foo$1` inherits from `scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1`:

```
Compiled from "AbstractFunction1.scala"
public abstract class scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1 extends java.lang.Object implements scala.Function1{

 . . . 

public boolean apply$mcZL$sp(java.lang.Object);
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	aload_1
   2:	invokestatic	#164; //Method scala/Function1$class.apply$mcZL$sp:(Lscala/Function1;Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
   5:	ireturn
```

Given that it's just a forwarder, for the closure to be eliminated the target method in `scala.Function1$class` would also have to be inlined, ie:

```
Compiled from "Function1.scala"
public abstract class scala.Function1$class extends java.lang.Object{
public static scala.Function1 compose(scala.Function1, scala.Function1);

 . . . 

public static boolean apply$mcZL$sp(scala.Function1, java.lang.Object);
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	aload_1
   2:	invokeinterface	#39,  2; //InterfaceMethod scala/Function1.apply:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
   7:	invokestatic	#43; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.unboxToBoolean:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
   10:	ireturn
```

Alone the resulting code size (if inlining handles forwarding methods as any other) would make the heuristics stop inlining sometime before getting there.

Thinking a bit more about this, given an invocation of `shouldLoadImplFor` with arguments:

```
  sym      == method apply$mcZL$sp
  receiver == anonymous class A$$anonfun$foo$1
```

as above, then `sym.isEffectivelyFinal` is doing the right thing when reporting `false`.

Rather, what `shouldLoadImplFor`  does *not* check is:
- a final `receiver` implies that non-overridden methods must be inherited from a superclass

The question then is whether ICode can be loaded for `receiver` and its superclasses (if not available). For inspiration one can look at:

```
    def lookupIMethod(meth: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Option[IMethod] = {
      def tryParent(sym: Symbol) = icodes icode sym flatMap (_ lookupMethod meth)

      (receiver.info.baseClasses.iterator map tryParent find (_.isDefined)).flatten
    }
```

In the case at hand, an attempt is made to load ICode for `concreteMethod.enclosingClass`, which doesn't help.
Check #6035 for details on why specialization gets confused and that leads to breaking inlining (due to missing specialized bridge).
So I went back and revisited this bug based on the state of specialization in master.

My findings are:

1. Vlad's test case from February 15th seems to be working in master (that is, there's no explicit call to apply)
2. Most of Paul's examples are not inlining
3. Greg's issue is linked to a different bug (#6043) which I think is a different issue than some of the others here.

So, I think it's worth closing this bug and opening a new bug (if necessary) for some of the issues specific to Paul's example (i.e. inferred type of accessors related to inlining) since right now the bug's state is a bit confused.

If we aren't going to close it, I'd like to get consensus on the test case for this bug (i.e. a source file and the desired output) since right now I'm not clear what it would take to consider it "fixed"
