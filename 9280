The proposal can do more than make non-compiling code compile; it would change the semantics of:

{code}
object Test {
  def foo(): () => String = () => ""
  val f: () => Any = foo
 
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(f()) // currently, <function0>, would be: ""
  }
}
{code}

I would argue that these are saner semantics, but we need to find a compatible path from here to there.

Perhaps we could deprecate and later remove eta expansion when the expected type is Function0. I wonder how much that comes up in the wild.
