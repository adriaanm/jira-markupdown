This code:

```scala
final class WeirdInlining(val i: Int) {
  @inline def t2 = i*2
  @inline def t4 = t2*2
}
```

produces this bytecode for `t2` and `t4` (with `scalac -optimise` using 2.8.0.RC1:

```scala
public int t2();
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	invokevirtual	SI-14; //Method i:()I
   4:	iconst_2
   5:	imul
   6:	ireturn

public int t4();
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	getfield	SI-11; //Field i:I
   4:	iconst_2
   5:	imul
   6:	iconst_2
   7:	imul
   8:	ireturn
```

That is, somehow the one-level inlining fails (in t2, by using invokevirtual insteand of getfield), but the two-level succeeds (in t4)!  2.7.7 optimizes properly; 2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease does the same as RC1.

Perhaps this doesn't matter, since the JVM is more than smart enough to fix this on its own, but it is peculiar.
(In r21749) Allow inlining for straight-line methods. Closes #3357, #3099. no review.
