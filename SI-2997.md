Compiler error when using multiple <- clauses and yield statement:
    val res = for {
      line <- Source.fromFile(file).getLines();
      item <- getStr(line)
    } yield item

src/test/Main.scala:30: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Option[String]
 required: Iterator[?]
      item <- getStr(line)
           ^
one error found

However the same code compiles if the yield is replaced with simple println:
    for {
      line <- Source.fromFile(file).getLines();
      item <- getStr(line)
    } println(item)

desugars to:
{code}
Source.fromFile(file).getLines().flatMap(line => getStr(line).map(item => item))
{code}
which gives the same error, as does the more simplified form:
{code}
def foo(it: Iterator[String]) = it.flatMap(Some(_))
{code}
if you wanted to report this as a bug, this would be the proper line of code to put in a minimal bug report.

however it's not a bug; this is working as designed. Iterator.flatMap expects a function of type  A => Iterator[B], but you're giving it an A => Option[B].  There is an implicit conversion from Option to Iterable, but there is no implicit conversion from Option to Iterator.

to get back to your original example, I'd suggest writing:
{code}
for { line <- Source.fromFile(file).getLines(); item <- getStr(line).iterator } yield item
{code}
if you want the result of the whole expression to be an Iterator.
