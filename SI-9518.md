I have lots of unit test code with lines like this:
```scala
@Test def bar() {
    ...
    val Seq(_, _) = foo() // produces warning unused
    ...
}
```

When I have warn-unused turned on, I get a warning on this:

    private val in method bar is never used.

But notice, there is no val here. I've used the underscore here. 

I don't have a workaround to suppress this warning other than rewriting as 
```scala
@Test def bar () {
    foo() match { case Seq(_,_) => /* ok */ }
}
```
Having to permute the source code into a match-case just to suppress this spurious warning is painful, and there is a loss of code symmetry I don't like, as lots of other very similar tests look like:
```scala
@Test def bar2() {
    val Seq(a, _) = foo2()
    assertEquals("a", a)
}
```
This does not produce the spurious warning.


Note: same problem occurs if you do this:
```scala
case class Foo(x: String, y: Int)

@Test def testFoo {
...
   val Foo("a", 5) = bar() // spurious warning about unused val
...
}
```
Again notice, there is no val to be unused here.
