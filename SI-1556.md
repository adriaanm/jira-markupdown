The following code type checks as expected, assuming we ignore Scala's presently broken intersection type semantics:
```scala
scala> trait A { type T <: Int }                  
defined trait A

scala> trait B { type T <: String }
defined trait B

scala> trait C { val x : A; val y : x.type#T }              
defined trait C

scala> trait D extends C { val x : A with B; val z = y.charAt(0) }
defined trait D
```
but the following does not
```scala
scala> trait A { type T = Int }                                   
defined trait A

scala> trait B { type T = String }                                
defined trait B

scala> trait C { val x : A; val y : x.type#T }                    
defined trait C

scala> trait D extends C { val x : A with B; val z = y.charAt(0) }
<console>:7: error: value charAt is not a member of D.this.x.T
       trait D extends C { val x : A with B; val z = y.charAt(0) }
```
This is extremely problematic as it masks several other severe bugs in the type system.
Actually, I've found an example where the problem arising when only using bounded type members, and no type aliases:
```scala
scala> trait A { type T <: Int }                              
defined trait A

scala> trait B { type T <: String }
defined trait B

scala> trait C { type U <: A with B; val x : U#T; val y = x.charAt(0) }
defined trait C

scala> trait D extends C { type U <: B with A; lazy val x = 2 }
<console>:7: error: overriding value x in trait C of type D.this.U#T;
 lazy value x has incompatible type
       trait D extends C { type U <: B with A; lazy val x = 2 }
```
And yes, `B with A` is considered a valid subtype of `A with B`:
```scala
scala> trait E { type U <: A with B }
defined trait E

scala> trait F extends E { type U <: B with A }
defined trait F
```
And yes, `(B with A)#T` is treated as being bounded by `Int` and `(A with B)#T` is treated as being bounded by `String`:
```scala
scala> def foo(arg: E#U#T) : String = arg      
foo: (E#U#T)String

scala> def bar(arg: F#U#T) : Int = arg
bar: (F#U#T)Int
```
