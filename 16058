=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Classes below fails to compile and asserts with included stack traces.

A few observations are that no crash happens if (work arounds):

* The order of named actual args are kept the same as formal args,

* There is no local val defined inside closure of arg expr, 

* The argument expression that contains a closure is evaluated and assigned to local val ahead of the named argument call A(b=..) .
