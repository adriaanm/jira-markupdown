I get the following error when I try to run the Scala 2.11.2 and 2.11.4 REPL or compile with scalac:
```scala

I see this error in two different machines. Interestingly, I can run 2.11.2 and 2.11.4 REPLs within sbt without any problems, and I can compile projects within an IDE as well. I also don't see this error using Scala 2.11.1 and below.

Additionally, `scala -nobootcp` and `scalac -nobootcp` does work for both version. This was suggested by Paul Phillips in scala/bug#4433.
