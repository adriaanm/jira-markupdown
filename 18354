It is common, when using cygwin + jline, to set the -Djline.terminal=<terminal class> property.  While Scala supports jline 2.x where you can instead use the string "unix" or "windows" here, it does not support the same class names as standard jline.    Jline 1.x *only* supported custom terminals via class name, forcing users cross between jline 1.x and 2.x to use class names.   HOwever, if you wish to use the scala REPL in an environment with other jlines, you are now unable to specify "jline.UnixTerminal" as the terminal for cygwin, while jline 2.x vanilla handles this perfectly.

SO, what it comes down to is that if Scala is going to "shade" the classes, it should NOT break the the canonical settings of jline.  I see one of two options:

(1) Provide a hack so that unshaded settings that may be class names are shaded and attempted.
(2) Use a shaded property name (scala.jline.terminal) for configuring Scala's terminal.
