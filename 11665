I don't think it's fair to expect we unmask every single duplicate. Thanks for reporting first as well as pointing out our oversight, though.
This new report came from a project that we knew was blocked by this, so it got fixed.

What are these wrong incentives you speak of? Not to look for existing bugs when reporting a new one? We're just going to have to accept we won't be able to fix all the open bugs with the resources we have, let alone keep all the tickets in our heads to spot duplicates as readily as you do. 

In the end, this is like a "jira chapter 11", a soft version of the bankruptcy idea that was floated on twitter not too long ago, except that declaring such "defeat" explicitly (which we have discussed internally multiple times) would probably be met with "ha! they imploded!" cheers if it came from us.

I do understand your frustration, and wish we could address it, but I really don't see the point of all this negativity given that we are already doing the best we can.
