in the spec section 1.1 (Identifiers) says:
```
id ::= plainid
     | '\'' stringLit '\''
```

but stringLit isn't defined anywhere. I think it should be {stringElement} (with the curly braces)

also, unrelated, but in section 1.3 the word "consuctive" appears. I say "word", but it isn't.

Why was this ticket closed? Moving to another text representation is not a valid reason, since this issue is about the *content*.

The issue is still not fixed, and the Markdown spec is not available anymore.
I only stumbled upon this issue because the spec that is linked on the website still contains the "stringLit". That link should probably be updated, too.
