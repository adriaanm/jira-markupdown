In 2.7.4 if I write the test methods with the parenthesis, the return type declaration (Unit) and the equals sign:
```scala
@Test
def alwaysFail(): Unit = {
  assert(false)
}
```

the tests are recognized most of the time. BTW I am still not able to select a source directory and execute all the tests in it.
