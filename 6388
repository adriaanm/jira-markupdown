Simon, the stuff about Scaladoc is irrelevant to the meat of this ticket, so I removed it from the description. I'd suggest adding it as a comment on the pull request instead (with a reference to this ticket).

And with the Scaladoc stuff removed, having the ticket assigned to "Scaladoc Team" no longer makes sense, so I'm changing the status of the ticket to "Invalid", since Paul said "The inferred type is correct."

The inferred type may be "correct" in some sense, but it certainly doesn't *seem* like the best type to be inferred here. Is this really how it must be? If it stays this way I think this is going to get noticed pretty frequently — especially by beginners.

I'll take it up on the mailing list.
