The type `String` is used a lot both in Java and Scala.

In particular, the Scala code
```scala
var weekday = "Mon"
```
is currently transformed to
```scala
var weekday$$1: scala.runtime.ObjectRef = new scala.runtime.ObjectRef("Mon");
```
I suggest to add the runtime class `StringRef` to the Scala library
```scala
public class StringRef implements java.io.Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = /*..*/;

    public String elem;
    public StringRef(String elem) { this.elem = elem; }
    public String toString() { return elem; }
}
```
and to transform the above code to the following
```scala
var weekday$$1: scala.runtime.StringRef = new scala.runtime.StringRef("Mon");
```
thus avoiding many useless cast operations.
