Why is that a useless warning? More importantly, why doesn't it complain about unreachable code, because that's what the warning implies? I guess because it doesn't know there's only one value of type Unit.  But if it can spot it for the type with two values, it can do it for the type with one value.
{code}
scala> true match { case true => true ; case false => false ; case _ => false }
<console>:8: warning: unreachable code
              true match { case true => true ; case false => false ; case _ => false }
                                                                               ^
{code}
(Is "unreachable code" being a warning rather than an error now a short term virtpatmat thing? I think it was better as an error.)
