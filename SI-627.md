Currently, the monad attached to a "for" comprehension remains the same throughout the whole construct. The following examples all return a `Set[Int]`.

```scala
for (i <- Set(1, 2)) yield i
for (i <- Set(1, 2); j <- Set(4, 5)) yield i
for (i <- Set(1, 2); j <- List(4, 5)) yield i
```

In other words, the monad is `Set` throughout the comprehensions. The monad type is fixed by the "entry" monad of the comprehension.

In theory, if would be possible to change the type of the monad mid-way through the comprehension. The following examples would all return a `List[Int]`.

```scala
for (i <- List(1, 2)) yield i
for (i <- Set(1, 2)); asList; j <- Set(4, 5)) yield i
for (i <- Set(1, 2); j <- Set("hey", "you"); asList) yield i // previous
```

How would it work? Basically the `asList` method is a special kind of generator in the comprehension: it changes the monadic type from any `Iterable` to `List`. Its type is the following.

```scala
def asList[A]: Iterable[(A)] => List[(A)]
def asList[A,B]: Iterable[(A,B)] => List[(A,B)]
...
```

The `A` and `B`-typed tuples in the old and new monads are the variables declared until there in the comprehension. In our `previous` example above, the monad-type change happens when `i` and `j` are already defined within the `Set` monad. They must be moved from there to the `List` monad, and that is exactly what the `asList` method does. The `previous` example would lead to calls of `asList` of the following form.

```scala
asList[Int, String](Set((1, "hey")))
asList[Int, String](Set((1, "you")))
asList[Int, String](Set((2, "hey")))
...
```

Now, is it useful? I don't know for sure. The use-case that lead to it was that of typing SQL constraints such as "`order by`" or "`unique`" in a "for" comprehension representing a SQL query. A normal SQL query returns a relation that is a multi-set of tuples (unordered, same tuple allowed multiple times). When an `ordered` constraint is added, the result is a list of tuples (ordered), if `unique` is added, it is a set (same tuple allowed once only).

Such a query may look as follows.

```scala
for (p <- table("people"), if p.age > 14, orderBy(p.name)) yield p
```

If `table` returns a `Set` — which is its proper relational type — the whole query will still be a `Set` at the end. It is, however, ordered and its type should be `List`. If `orderBy` was such a monad-changing method, the type of the query could be correct.

I file the idea as a postponed low-priority enhancement which should be seen more as a reminder for an idea than an actual request.
