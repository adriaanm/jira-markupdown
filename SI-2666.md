I can't find anything about in specification.
As we all know we can write something like this: 
{{val x: Unit = 23}}
but following example won't compile:
{code}
object A {
  class B

  def foo(x: Unit, t: Int): Int = 4

  def foo(x: Int, y: B): Int = 5

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val x = foo(5, 5)
    println("x = " + x)
  }
}
{code}
Is it means that type Unit should be treated specially. Like it has own type and only Nothing <: Unit <: AnyVal <: Any
But if expected type is Unit then expected type is undefined. Or may be here must be something else?
