Works as a regular class, not as a value class.

```scala
  import scala.util.control.Exception._

  implicit class RichCatch[T](val c: Catch[T]) extends AnyVal {
    def validation[U >: T](u: => U): Either[Throwable, U] = c.either(u) 
  }
```
This is #6482, fixed by ff9f60f420c0 in master. I believe it's an easy backport.
