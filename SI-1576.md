I have a project that causes stack overflows in the .log and in the IDE. Once this happens IDE syntax highlighting stops. I'm not sure this is a pluggin issue, but it makes the project unworkable. Some times saving will not recompile, error don't appear and I have so clean and rebuild to make it work. 

Command line compiler work fine on the code. 

I have created a small project that contains two file and will cause the stackoverflows. I commented the code that causes the issue at the end of vcc/DialogTest.scala.

Uncomment the block, save, close and open, and you will get Stackoverflows, and highlight failures.

I'm using version 2.7.2-final of the plugin and command line compiler
Did some aditional testing and I think the issue may be caused by the compiler, and the incomplete override of methods from the abstract class. 

Both syntax are accepted in the compiler (both pluggin and stand-alone), but one format makes the Plugin run into stack overflows. I think there is some but in the compiler with regards of these structures. It may be a bug

Problem 1)

In file vcc/DialogTest.scala in the trouble block, if this line is present:


```scala
    val columns=List(("col1",classOf[String]), "col2",classOf[java.lang.Integer]))
```

I get:

error in presentation normal compile 
java.lang.StackOverflowError

However if this is the line:
```scala
    val columns=List[(String,java.lang.Class[_])](("col1",classOf[String]),("col2",classOf[java.lang.Integer]))
```
The code loads perfectly

Problem 2) 

This line in vcc/DialogTest.scala will case errors when I open the code:
```scala
   def apply(col:Int,obj:(String,Integer))= col match { case 0=> obj._1; case 1=> obj._2}
```
The following error occurs:

An error has occurred. See error log for more details.
scala.tools.eclipse.javaelements.ScalaAnonymousClassElement cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jdt.core.IField

Change it to: 
```scala
    def apply(col:Int,obj:(String,Integer)):java.lang.Object= col match { case 0=> obj._1; case 1=> obj._2}
```
No problem happens...


Case 3)

Also, having focused on these lines, I create a smaller single file, and then the behavior is a little different:
```scala
package vcc

abstract class TableModelRowProjection[T] {

  val columns:List[(String,java.lang.Class[_])]
  def size = columns.size
  def setter:PartialFunction[(Int,T,Any),Unit]
  def getColumnClass(col:Int):java.lang.Class[_]=columns(col)._2
  def getColumnName(col:Int):String=columns(col)._1
  def isEditable(col:Int,obj:T)=if(setter!=null)setter.isDefinedAt(col,null.asInstanceOf[T],null) else false
  def apply(col:Int,obj:T):java.lang.Object
  def set(col:Int,obj:T,value:Any):Unit=if(setter!=null && setter.isDefinedAt(col,obj,value)) setter(col,obj,value)
}


object DialogTest extends Application {
  
  var proj=new TableModelRowProjection[(String,Integer)] {
    //val columns=List[(String,java.lang.Class[_])](("col1",classOf[String]),("col2",classOf[java.lang.Integer]))
    val columns=List(("col1",classOf[String]),("col2",classOf[java.lang.Integer]))
    def setter=null
    //def setter={ case (0,o,v) => println("You set "+o+" field 0 to "+v) }
    def apply(col:Int,obj:(String,Integer)):java.lang.Object= col match { case 0=> obj._1; case 1=> obj._2}
    //def apply(col:Int,obj:(String,Integer))= col match { case 0=> obj._1; case 1=> obj._2}
  }
}

```


If I use this code a do a "Clean" to rebuild, when I open the vcc/DialogTest.scala, I get no syntax highlight and Stackoverflow on the .log

If change the definitions, save, close and open. I get proper syntax highlight. In a single file the apply function being fully typed does not seem to change the end result. 

Now with the good code a swap the columns definition, and save. Now I have "illegal cyclical reference"	when I let the mouse hover over the columns variable.

Swap again and save, all looks nice, but when I close and open. I get no syntax highlighting and no tips. 

Comment both and uncomment the fully typed and save, and all in nice. Including on a close and open.

The apply function seems to be ok. When it's all in one file. No matter what format I use.
I see similar behavior, though I lack such a detailed test case.  This is extremely frustrating.  If I could vote for this bug, I would.

Because syntax highlighting and code completion in the plugin depend on scalac, if the latter fails (in this case with a StackOverflowError) then so will the former. When this happens it would be extremely helpful if you could try and isolate a minimal test case which reproduces the problem with the command line tools and open a ticket with the component set to "compiler".

It's also possible that you haven't given scalac or Eclipse enough stack for you specific codebase: have you tried increasing it from the default, and if so, to what?

Replying to [comment:5 milessabin]:
> Are you able to reproduce this outside of Eclipse using the command line tools?

I've been tackling this problem for a month. The command line compiler works fine. And the plugin will work ok if you clean the project and rebuild.

When I have to edit the files with this code partern, I keep getting stack overflows. So what I do is edit, save, clean project and let it rebuild. Otherwise the code is not really generated on a save. 

Looks to me like something in the way the plugin inspects the code generated is not write. The code compiles on rebuild and Command line scalac.

OK, thanks.

Are you able to try with the 2.7.3.RC1 Eclipse plugin?
Is here a second option controlling the stack size for scalac, within Eclipse?
I know how to adjust my Eclipse heap size, and it is already increased, and
next I will adjust the stack size.  (But in general, if you suggest that a bug
reporter "try X", including some guidance for trying X would be helpful.)

In addition, I see these error messages in the Error log on startup:
```scala
While loading class "lampion.presentation.Presentations$$",
thread "Thread[worker-PFC,1,main]" timed out waiting (5000ms)
for thread "Thread[org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.JavaReconciler,1,main]"
to finish starting bundle
"reference:file:plugins/ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core_2.8.0.r16829-b20081231022423.jar r299".
To avoid deadlock, thread "Thread[worker-PFC,1,main]" is proceeding but
"lampion.presentation.Presentations$$" may not be fully initialized.
```

and

```scala
While loading class "scala.tools.eclipse.javaelements.ScalaCompilationUnitFilter",
thread "Thread[main,6,main]" timed out waiting (5000ms) for thread
"Thread[org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.JavaReconciler,1,main]" to finish starting bundle

To avoid deadlock, thread "Thread[main,6,main]" is proceeding but
"scala.tools.eclipse.javaelements.ScalaCompilationUnitFilter" may not be fully initialized.
```

Is this perhaps relevant?  Is there an option I could adjust that might increased the timeout setting to see if that would help?

You can change the stack size by specifying the -Xss argument (via -vmargs) either on the command line you use to launch Eclipse or in your Eclipse config.ini.

The following are the relevant lines from the config.ini I use when working on the Scala compiler, library and Eclipse plugin in Eclipse 3.4.1 ... I would Imagine that the Fortress project is of a similar size and complexity.

```scala
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
-vmargs
-Xms256m
-Xmx1024m
-XX:PermSize=64m
-Xss1M
```
Similar settings here (now):
```scala
-vmargs
-Xdock:icon=../Resources/Eclipse.icns
-XstartOnFirstThread
-Xms256m
-Xmx784m
-Xss1m
-XX:MaxPermSize=256m
```

(Note that, strictly speaking, we don't know for sure that 1m is an increased stack size, since the default is a platform-dependent secret, and Google's information is stale.  But it is at the upper limit of "default stack sizes" on all the platforms for which I could find information.)

This did not change the two timeouts on startup.  I poked around Eclipse's many preferences, and discovered that someone-not-me had disabled Content Assist (this is not something you would do accidentally).  Was this a side-effect of the stack overflow that I saw (once)?  I did check to be sure that this did not come from some setting file that might have inadvertently been checked in to the repository, and that appeared to not be the cause (it is an Eclipse option, not a Project option, so this is a consistent discovery).

To change Content Assist (on MacOS):

Eclipse -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Advanced

And when I click "Restore Defaults", the settings change, and then I have my content assist back.  I will watch for any changes.

The restored defaults do survive shutdown and startup, including the two initialization timeouts reported above.

The timeouts are unrelated to the StackOverflowErrors (they're either harmless noise or side-effects of something more serious).

Can you clarify your last message? It almost sounds as though with the updated stack size and the content assist option reenabled you no longer have the originally reported problem? Is that correct?
I think that the originally reported problem is sporadic (for me, at least), and what I am wondering is if the stack overflow error triggered some independent action by eclipse to disable content assist.  Something turned off content assist, and it was not me.  I will be editing more seriously later today, and perhaps that will retrigger the stack overflow (or not).

By-the-way, the stack overflow error, which was lurking in one of the log files:

```scala
java.lang.StackOverflowError
	at scala.tools.nsc.ast.TreeInfo.firstConstructor(TreeInfo.scala:143)
	at scala.tools.nsc.ast.TreeInfo.firstConstructor(TreeInfo.scala:147) (1000 times)
```

I think it's highly unlikely that a scalac StackOverflowError would cause the content assist to be disabled.
I'm willing to test with 2.7.3RC1 despite my fear of breaking the current install that is working well enough. But when I do: Help > Software Update.. > Update.. I get the following mistake:

```scala
An error occurred while collecting items to be installed
  No repository found containing: ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core/osgi.bundle/2.7.3.RC1
  No repository found containing: ch.epfl.lamp.sdt/org.eclipse.update.feature/2.7.3.RC1
  No repository found containing: scala.library/osgi.bundle/2.7.3.RC1

```

I've had this before, and ended up wrecking the whole enve trying to fix this. How do I correct this.
