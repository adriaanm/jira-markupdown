The following works in 2.9.1 (and earlier versions) but fails in trunk (2011-11-21):

{code}
object WithOpTest {

trait WithOp extends Cloneable {

  def f: this.type = this

  def g1: this.type = {
    f
  }

  def g2: this.type = {
    val t = f
    t
  }

}

}
{code}

Using f directly in g1 is OK but assigning it to an intermediate variable in g2 fails:

{code}

 found   : t.type (with underlying type WithOpTest.WithOp)
 required: WithOp.this.type
    t

Adding an explicit type annotation ": this.type" to t also makes it work.
