When using a macro to find annotations the macro is unable to find the annotations on modification of the parent classes interface. The macro is run, but the annotations list of the symbol of interest is empty. However, once the file which executes these macros is recompiled, the annotations are again found.
Minimal example: https://github.com/bryce-anderson/scalaerror/
This is an unfortunate consequence of lazy loading employed by scalac.

The workaround is elaborate, though effective. Put the following lines before println:
```scala
m.typeSignature // force loading method's signature
m.annotations.foreach(_.tpe) // force loading all the annotations
```
