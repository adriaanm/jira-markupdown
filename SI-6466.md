[scaladoc interface bug, we should have a look at this during the Monday docspree]

to reproduce:
{code}
$ cat a.scala 
/** See [[foo]].
 *  @group hello
 */
class C {
  def foo = 1
}
$ scaladoc-2.10.0-wip -groups a.scala
model contains 2 documentable templates
{code}

Now open index.html in the browser. You'll get the root package with class C as a member. Click the link to foo in C's description. You'll get to class C and foo will be highlighted. So far so good.

Now, you're in class C's page, click again on the link to foo from the class description in the upper side of the main panel -- *it should scroll to foo and highlight it. It doesn't do either of these.* (you may need to resize the window to something smaller to check it's not scrolling)

Another example can be seen on:
http://chara.epfl.ch/~ureche/scaladoc/library/scala/language$.html#higherKinds:languageFeature.higherKinds

1) The highlighting persists even though it should fade out
2) Clicking on any of the links in object language's description doesn't do anything
