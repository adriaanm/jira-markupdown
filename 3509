{code}
class Test {
  def foo {
    private def bar {}
  }
}
{code}
produces [[BR]]
_error: illegal start of statement[[BR]]
private def bar {}_

I'm unsure what would be better message, but the point is that the private modifier in this context is useless, because I'm already nested in a block. I find the current message puzzling, as I don't see a __statement__ here.
