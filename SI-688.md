The Parser expects a semicolon or an additional newline after the annotated type.

{code}
class ann extends Annotation
object A {
  type t = Int @ann
  def a: t = 1
}


TypeNl.scala:5: error: ';' expected but 'def' found.
  def a: t = 1
  ^
one error found
{code}


This is because annotations may be separated by newlines, which makes sense when they're used as prefix (e.g. at a definition). The following is recognized by the parser:

{code}
object B {
  @ann
  @ann
  def a = 1

  type t = int @ann
  @ann

  def b: t = 1
}
{code}
