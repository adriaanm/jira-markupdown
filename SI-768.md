I'm using 2.7.1-RC1. this code:
{code}
val m = new collection.immutable.HashMap[Int,Int]
println(m.size)
m(1) = 1
println(m.size)
{code}
prints:
{code}
0
-1
{code}

shouldn't the -1 be 0?


It seems like the same bug affects immutable.HashSet too:

{code}
    val m = new collection.immutable.HashSet[Int]
    println(m.size)
    m + 1
    println(m.size)
{code}

prints exactly the same as the report here. The fix only seems to fix HashMap.
Thanks for having spotted this. It's fixed now in HashSet as well.

I was curious if the immutable.HashSet part of the fix would have any effect on ticket SI-454. While testing it, it seems like SI-454 is the same as this _but_ the immutable.HashSet fix is incorrect. It does:

{code}
s += tableSize 
{code}

instead of

{code}
s += m.tableSize 
{code}

So, once you fix the "fix", feel free to close SI-454 too. :)
