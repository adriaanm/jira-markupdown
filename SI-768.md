I'm using 2.7.1-RC1. this code:
```scala
val m = new collection.immutable.HashMap[Int,Int]
println(m.size)
m(1) = 1
println(m.size)
```
prints:
```scala
0
-1
```

shouldn't the -1 be 0?

It seems like the same bug affects immutable.HashSet too:

```scala
    val m = new collection.immutable.HashSet[Int]
    println(m.size)
    m + 1
    println(m.size)
```

prints exactly the same as the report here. The fix only seems to fix HashMap.
Thanks for having spotted this. It's fixed now in HashSet as well.
I was curious if the immutable.HashSet part of the fix would have any effect on ticket #454. While testing it, it seems like #454 is the same as this *but* the immutable.HashSet fix is incorrect. It does:

```scala
s += tableSize 
```

instead of

```scala
s += m.tableSize 
```

So, once you fix the "fix", feel free to close #454 too. :)
