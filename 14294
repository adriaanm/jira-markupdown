The lexer in trunk does not allow dot-invoking methods on ints that start with a "d". This is a regression from 2.7.x.

Example code:
```scala
class RichInt(n: Int) {
  def days = 1000*60*60*24*n
}

implicit def RichInt(n: Int): RichInt = new RichInt(n)

10.days
```

Produces:
```scala
error: Invalid literal number
       10.days
       ^
```

A workaround is to invoke the method without a dot.
```scala
10 days
```
