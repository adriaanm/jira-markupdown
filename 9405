There are 2 problems reported in this ticket: vals not being found, and defs not being found sometime.

Some information about the vals is provided by scope completion. Scala IDE currently filters out this information. We will see if it can be fixed on the Scala IDE side, or if we need to open another ticket for this case.

So, the remaining test case for the defs is the following:

{code:scala}
object Cont {
  def longName() {}
}

class ImportOut {
  import Cont._

  def foo {
    /*_*/   // `longName` is in the scope members
  }
}

class ImportIn {
  def foo {
    import Cont._
    /*_*/   // `longName` is not in the scope members
  }
}
{code}
