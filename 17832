This is a very minor issue.

If we define the following in the REPL
```scala
object Foo { val `1 ?` = () }
```
and we type:
```scala
Foo.<tab>
```
then "1 ?" is suggested as an option.
If we type:
```scala
Foo.1<tab>
```
then this autocompletes to
```scala
Foo.1 ?
```
which isn't valid, so ought to complete to
```scala
Foo.`1 ?`
```
Interestingly,
```scala
Foo.`<tab>
```
will suggest all members of Foo correctly, though (for example),
```scala
Foo.`c<tab>
```
appears to search the global namespace, offering suggestions such as classOf, clone, com and collection.
