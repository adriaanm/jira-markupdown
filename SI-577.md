Currently, case class parameters are not documented by scaladoc. Since they are public `vals`, they should appear as fields of the class.

Additionally, there is no syntax to attach scaladoc comments for such fields. This can be annoying, so it would be nice if something like this worked:

```scala
case class Category(
  /** Categorization scheme */ scheme: String,
  /** User defined category */ value: String)
...
```

Currently, the above comments are ignored. It should not be very difficult to add, if the parser already recognizes them.
(In r22739) [Scaladoc] Improve the documentation of primary constructor. 
Adds a @constructor for commenting the primary constructor. It also adds some comments for the primary constructor (@params, @deprecated) which are initialised in the class comment. Members that come from primary constructor parameters (val parameters or parameters of a case class) are listed as members with the comment given using the @param tag (closes #254, closes #577).
Case class signature now begins by 'case class' instead of 'class'.
Review by dubochet
The solution implemented does not use that syntax: 

```scala
case class Category(
  /** Categorization scheme */ scheme: String,
  /** User defined category */ value: String)
...
```

but this one: 
```scala
/** 
   * @param scheme Categorization scheme
   * @param value User defined category
   */
case class Category(
   scheme: String,
   value: String)
...
```
