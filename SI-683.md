If I have a file with an object with a main method that has no errors, and I also have another file that has one or more errors in it, then when I try to run the one without errors it doesn't run because the compiler does not generate source files.

I have tried with Build Automatically both on and off.

I am running on Mac OS X Leopard. Eclipse 3.3. Latest plugin as of 2008-03-26 (2.7.0-14271-final_0).

When I was having trouble with this originally, I created a new Scala project in Eclipse, and copied over the package containing the source for the object without errors. It ran fine. Then I copied over the package containing the source for the object that had errors, and it did not run (class not found). When I've gotten the class not found error, and I've looked in the bin directory, there are no .class files in there.

Seems like the compiler is aborting without producing any output when one or more classes have errors. This is not expected behavior. Things that can compile cleanly should. You should be able to incrementally fix things and get more and more of the stuff working. As it is you have to fix everything before anything will run.

In my case, the package containing the error sorted lexicographically before the one that had no error that I was trying to run.  I thought maybe if I arranged for it to come after the package that is good, I'd get the output files for the good stuff, but that didn't work either.


I meant tpo write:

The only solution I see is to do dependency tracking in Eclipse, and still compile those files that do _not_ depend on any erroneous file.
