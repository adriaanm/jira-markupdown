One comment on this bug: it's well-known that specialization doesn't work with class-inheritance (it's described in the paper and also in some of the docs). Thus, I don't think this example would ever work.

If you change Inter into a trait, you'll see specialization occuring:
```scala
public class Baz extends java.lang.Object implements Inter{
    public boolean apply$mcI$sp(int);
    public boolean apply(java.lang.String);
    public boolean apply(java.lang.Object);
    public Baz();
}
```

That said, AnyRef specialization is currently turned off, so the only specialization available is apply$mcI$sp but I think the point still stands.

I only checked this bug because I'm trying to go through and close old specialization bugs that might now be fixed in master.
