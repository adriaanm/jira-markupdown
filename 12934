The code
```scala
object Test extends Application {
  val xs = List(1, 2)
  println(xs ::: (for (i <- 0 until 9) yield i))
}
```
produces the following error:
```scala
test.scala:3: error: value ::: is not a member of RandomAccessSeq.Projection[Int]
  println(xs ::: (for (i <- 0 until 9) yield i))
             ^
one error found
```
