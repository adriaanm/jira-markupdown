(In r24093) closes scala/bug#3619, scala/bug#4141. need to exclude implicits from class C in calls to superconstructor from C's constructor.
replaced the epic outer.outer.outer by something more robust that goes to the context corresponding to the enclosing class

nextOuter determines which context is searched next for implicits (after `this`, which contributes `newImplicits` below)
in most cases, it is simply the outer context
if we're owned by a constructor, the actual current context and the conceptual context are different when it comes to scoping:
the current conceptual scope is the context enclosing the blocks that represent the constructor body
(TODO: why is there more than one such block in the outer chain?)
