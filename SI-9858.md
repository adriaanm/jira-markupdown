When extending DelayedInit trait the field referencing to an outer class "$outer" in the generated "$delayedInit$body" is not marked as synthetic. At the same time for any normal usage of inner classes generated "$outer" field is marked as synthetic.

See: https://gist.github.com/pbadenski/982dc47e8636a0f706c7bf46d610574f
From [Constructors.scala#L269|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/b79c0d124e839e9e7ae5db883488c0134642472b/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/Constructors.scala#L269] it looks like {{outerField}} is never given a {{SYNTHETIC}} flag. Also, looking a bit through the history of this Transformer, it doesn't seem to have ever been applying {{SYNTHETIC}} on that field unlike what you'd find in {{ExplicitOuter}}.

However, the syntax tree for the example provided seems to generate a {{<synthetic>}} {{Outer$delayedInit$body}}, which in turn contains the {{$outer}} which is not marked {{<synthetic>}} as shown below:
{code}
package <empty> {
  class Outer extends Object with DelayedInit {
    private[this] val code: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer = _;
    <stable> <accessor> private def code(): scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer = Outer.this.code;
    override def delayedInit(body: Function0): Unit = {
      Outer.this.code().+=(body);
      ()
    };
    final <synthetic> def delayedEndpoint$Outer$1: Unit = {
      Outer.this.code = new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer();
      ()
    };
    def <init>(): Outer = {
      Outer.super.<init>();
      Outer.this.delayedInit(new Outer$delayedInit$body(Outer.this));
      ()
    }
  };
  final <synthetic> class Outer$delayedInit$body extends runtime.AbstractFunction0 {
    <paramaccessor> private[this] val $outer: Outer = _;
    final def apply(): Object = {
      Outer$delayedInit$body.this.$outer.delayedEndpoint$Outer$1();
      scala.runtime.BoxedUnit.UNIT
    };
    def <init>($outer: Outer): Outer$delayedInit$body = {
      if ($outer.eq(null))
        throw null
      else
        Outer$delayedInit$body.this.$outer = $outer;
      Outer$delayedInit$body.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
{code}
Yup, 2.12.0-M5 seems to produce a similar tree. From the git history, it looks like it's been this way at least since 2006-2007 (that's the farthest I looked).

Also, I tried adding a {{SYNTHETIC}} flag to the field in the transformer, which generates a tree like this one:
{code}
package <empty> {
  class Outer extends Object with DelayedInit {
    private[this] val code: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer = _;
    <stable> <accessor> private def code(): scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer = Outer.this.code;
    override def delayedInit(body: Function0): Unit = {
      Outer.this.code().+=(body);
      ()
    };
    final <synthetic> def delayedEndpoint$Outer$1: Unit = {
      Outer.this.code = new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer();
      ()
    };
    def <init>(): Outer = {
      Outer.super.<init>();
      Outer.this.delayedInit(new Outer$delayedInit$body(Outer.this));
      ()
    }
  };
  final <synthetic> class Outer$delayedInit$body extends runtime.AbstractFunction0 {
    <synthetic> <paramaccessor> private[this] val $outer: Outer = _;
    final def apply(): Object = {
      Outer$delayedInit$body.this.$outer.delayedEndpoint$Outer$1();
      scala.runtime.BoxedUnit.UNIT
    };
    def <init>($outer: Outer): Outer$delayedInit$body = {
      if ($outer.eq(null))
        throw null
      else
        Outer$delayedInit$body.this.$outer = $outer;
      Outer$delayedInit$body.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
{code}

However, I'm not sure having a {{<synthetic>}} inside a {{<synthetic>}} is valid/correct.
