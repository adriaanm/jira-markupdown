indeed. i agree with the conclusion of SI-2296 that a compile time error would be sufficient, as you can work around it:

{code}
    private class Schnuck extends javax.swing.AbstractListModel {
        model =>
        val observer : PartialFunction[ Any, Unit ] = {
            case "Test" => fireAdded( 0, 1 )
        }
        def getSize = 0
        def getElementAt( idx: Int ) : AnyRef = "egal"
        private def fireAdded( i0: Int, i1: Int ) {
           fireIntervalAdded( model, i0, i1 )
        }
    }
{code}
