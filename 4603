(In r23011) part 2 of the dependent method refactoring: improved interaction with implicit search (needed for oopsla paper)

more to come in this area, see e.g. SI-3346 (stanford edsl stuff)

reopens SI-13, which wasn't fixed properly before imo, anyway (have a look at -Xprint:typer output before this commit: a type that's not expressible in surface syntax is inferred -- also removed duplicate test file)

closes SI-3731: co-evolve type alias type symbols when their rhs is updated and they are referenced by type selections (see typemap)
