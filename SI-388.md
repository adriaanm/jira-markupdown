I think it's fair to say that for a language to compete with mainstream languages, the strength of its libraries is critical.  A strong I/O library is something that no programming language should be without.
This trak only covers the Scala standard distribution. A good IO library is desirable, but it has to come from the community, not from EPFL. So I don't think the ticket is appropriate.
