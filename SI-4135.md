When compiling the following code (see bellow), no exception is thrown, even though the test call (test(tail, test(elements, acc).reverse)) is not in a tail position.

```scala
  sealed trait Element[T]
  case class SingleElement[T](value: T) extends Element[T]
  case class ListElement[T](values: List[Element[T]]) extends Element[T]

  object TestElements {
    import scala.annotation.tailrec
    @tailrec
    def test[T](list: List[Element[T]], acc: List[T]): List[T] = {
      list match {
        case ListElement(elements) :: tail => test(tail, test(elements, acc).reverse)
        case SingleElement(element) :: tail => test(tail, element :: acc)
        case Nil => acc.reverse
      }
    }
  }
```



=== Compile exception should be raised that the code is not able to be optimized ===

(In r23941) A pretty severe bug in the recognition of tail call elimination.
It turns out that Tailcalls will perform "partial elimination" in
situations such as:

  @annotation.tailrec final def f(x: Int): Int = f(f(x))

The outer call to f1 becomes a jump, but the inner call remains
as it was.  I implemented @tailrec under the impression that if
the optimization had taken place, it had gone all the way.  So
this is now fixed with a direct examination of the rewritten tree.

While I was in there I threw in some improved error reporting:
the error positioning is now on the call which is not in tail
position rather than the method declaration.

Closes #4135, no review.
