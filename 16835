http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html says:

The returned collection is made up of all elements x which satisfy the invariant:
{code}
from <= indexOf(x) < until
{code}

That's not true - List("a", "b", "a").slice(0, 2) returns List("a", "b"), although the third element also satisfies the formula.

Besides, it should be "inequality", not "invariant", shouldn't it?
