(In r23435) Added separate bitmaps for private and transient lazy vals. Closes scala/bug#3038, scala/bug#1573. Review by dragos.
I had to fix a couple of initialization issues that checkinit forced me to do and that weren't a problem before because the bitmap was serialized even for @transitive. For that I needed to change the setters in checkinit so that they also update the bitmap.
