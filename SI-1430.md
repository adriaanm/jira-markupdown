{code}
package test1;
interface Foo {
   public void foo();
}
public interface Bar extends Foo {
   public void bar();
}
{code}

and Scala 
{code}
package test2
class Baz(x: Bar) {
  x.foo
}
{code}

Scalac generates bytecode referencing `Foo.foo` instead of the most specific `Bar.foo`, which results in an `IllegalAccessError` at runtime.
(extempore in [r26078|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26078]) Fix for erroneous bytecode generation.

A remedy for an IllegalAccessError where generated bytecode
referred to an inaccessible type.  Closes SI-1430.

Bonus materials:

 - tore out all the invokedynamic support.  The shipped jdk7
 implementation shows limited resemblance to the one this was written
 against; the code mostly serves to distract.  (I think I could get
 invokedynamic working pretty quickly, except that it would
 mean having a codebase for java7 and one for 5-6, which is not a yak
 I wish to shave today.)

 - gave NullClass and NothingClass objects of their own, which
 allowed a nice polymorphic simplification of isSubClass, plus a
 couple other streamlinings.
In the above example, it's intended that {{Bar}} extends {{Foo}}, isn't it? I'm asking because this is related to SI-7253.
