The same code is emitted in 2.11.8, but that doesn't manifest as a compilation error. Perhaps the `Assign` is manually typechecked and as such doesn't incur the type error?
```scala
    def xx(verb: String, a: Array[Int]): Unit = {
      val reYYYY: scala.util.matching.Regex = scala.this.Predef.augmentString("(\\d\\d\\d\\d)").r;
      {
        <synthetic> var rc6: Boolean = false;
        <synthetic> var x3: String = null.asInstanceOf[String];
        {
          case <synthetic> val x1: CharSequence = verb;
          case8(){
            if ("time".==(x1))
              {
                rc6 = true;
                x3 = x1;
```
