I just ran into this as well when porting my code from 2.9.2 to 2.10.0(-M5), so I realized it's a regression. Is it going to be fixed for 2.10.0? If so, shouldn't this be reprioritized as critical to ensure that it's actually fixed before release? scala/bug#5031 is currently marked as minor.

I'm currently modifying my source (and others') to workaround this, but I'd like to understand if this is going to be fixed before 2.10 or not - if it's going to be fixed, then I could undo the changes or not push them.
