That would certainly be a good idea; there is no Scaladoc documentation for, e.g., ensuring -- it seems to be described only in external commentary such as your book.

But what about "abc" + (null: Any), or "abc" + ("def": Any)? That is handled internally by the compiler, **as if** there were an implicit conversion in Predef, but there isn't one AFAICS. (anovstrup, this applies to your point (of confusion)).
