I just tripped on comparing a List to an Int.  I missed the nicety of a 'will always yield false' warning.  
{code}
$ ./scala 
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20130430-161342-13cf0481d2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_11).

scala> List("bah") == 1
res1: Boolean = false
{code}

(warns nicely if reversed)

{code}
scala> 1 == List("foo")
<console>:8: warning: comparing values of types Int and List[String] using `==' will always yield false
              1 == List("foo")
                ^
res0: Boolean = false
{code}

Realizing that it's hard to know for certain if someone has overridden equals, I suppose this is tricky.  Maybe an annotation on some library equals methods: @neverEqualsPrimitive.  Not clear to me how often this comes up or whether there's anything more reasonable to be done.
