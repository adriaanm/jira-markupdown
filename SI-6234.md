The consumedTypes/producedTypes for icode instructions are redundantly defined in 3 separate places:
 - Opcodes.scala (consumedTypes/producedTypes)
 - ICodeCheckers.scala (for checking icode)
 - TypeFlowAnalysis.scala (for computing types on the stack at each
program point)

Since the Opcodes types are the only ones visible outside, I suggest
we use them in ICodeCheckers.scala and TypeFlowAnalysis.scala too. But
we should make such changes after the release, after chilling out
by the lake with a glass of good wine for a couple of days.

A relevant discussion on this can be found at:

`TypeFlowAnalysis` does not define any `consumedTypes` or `producedTypes` for ICode instructions. The closest it does is using one of them, in just one place, as shown next:

```
        case cm @ CALL_METHOD(_, _) =>
          stack pop cm.consumed
          cm.producedTypes foreach (stack push _)
```

I don't see why `TypeFlowAnalysis` should be touched at all.
I guess it would make sense to have it do something like:
```scala
  stack popAndCheck cm.consumedTypes
  cm.producedTypes foreach (stack push _)
```
And the same for all instructions. WDTY?
There's no need to replace current functionality in TypeFlowAnalysis, which is working fine as we all know.

Instead, further assertions can be added. In the example, before popping from the stack, an assert can be added to cross-check with `cm.consumedTypes`.
