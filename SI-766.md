(new plugin)

Just tried with latest nightly build and the bug still exists.
I've tried just now and it's still there.
Fixed in r17096. Code completion is now reusing the underlying JDT implementation so behaviour should be the same as for Java: the default is to insert; press ctrl during operation to overwrite.
