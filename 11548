The sbt from version 0.13.7 uses scala compiler to parse the whole file. The problem is, that if you split the file statement by statement and send to the compiler - all will be OK. If you send whole file - you will receive the compilation error.
See:
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/1606

The test from repl:

{code:scala}
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A {

val a = <a/>

val b = <c/><d/>
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined object A
{code}

And:

{code:scala}
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A {

val a = <a/><c/>

val b = <b/>
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:5: error: ';' expected but 'val' found.
val b = <b/>
{code}
