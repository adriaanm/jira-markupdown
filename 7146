For milestone 1 (I can still reproduce this error in M1) 
there seems to be a workaround

add this
```
-keep class scala.collection.SeqLike {
    public protected *;
}
```
to the proguard options

But in milestone 5, I cannot reproduce this error.
Has it been solved as a side effect of another issue?
Or can anyone reproduce this error in M5?
