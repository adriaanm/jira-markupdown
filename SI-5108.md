The rewrite of rep1 in the Parsers trait in [r20573](https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/changeset/20573) caused a regression of #SI-1100.

The inner method of rep1 should probably be changed to:
```scala
@tailrec def applyp(in0: Input): ParseResult[List[T]] = p0(in0) match {
  case Success(x, rest) => elems += x ; applyp(rest)
  case e: Error         => e
  case _                => Success(elems.toList, in0)
}
```
Just adding the line with case e: Error

(Is it ok to create a new issue in such cases, or better to reopen the old one?)
(extempore in [r25881](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25881)) Fix for combinator regression.

Propagate Error in repN. I have no time for a test case, I will gladly
take a contribution. References #1100, Closes #5108, No review.
Pull request for test case: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/108
(extempore in [r25889](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25889)) Test case for #1100/#5108.
