See the two instances I have below (taken from REPL)

Native XML handling, preserves the newline character.
{code}
scala> <foo key="val
     | ue" />
res0: scala.xml.Elem = 
<foo key="val
ue"/>
{code}

XML.loadString, however, converts to a newline.
{code}
scala> XML.loadString("""<foo key="val
     | ue" />""")
res3: scala.xml.Elem = <foo key="val ue"/>
{code}

As such, the XML blocks are not equal.
{code}
scala> res0 equals res3
res6: Boolean = false
{code}

Newlines NOT inside of attributes are preserved in both instances are are equal as such.

{code}
scala> <foo>
     | bar
     | baz
     | </foo>
res4: scala.xml.Elem = 
<foo>
bar
baz
</foo>

scala> XML.loadString("""<foo>
     | bar
     | baz
     | </foo>""")
res5: scala.xml.Elem = 
<foo>
bar
baz
</foo>

scala> res4 equals res5
res7: Boolean = true
{code}
I have to disagree with the categorization of this issue as "Minor". Not properly escaping attributes means that scala.xml does not comply to the xml spec. This should be very easy to fix, but to work around this issue is a _major_ pain in the ass.

So why not just fix this? I know scala.xml is on the way to deprecation. But a lot of people are still using it. Especially given that there is no official replacement, and it is still shown in the examples in all the books such as "Programming in Scala".
