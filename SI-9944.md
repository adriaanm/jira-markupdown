Having the following piece of code saved with Windows-style line endings (CRLF)
{noformat}
    implicit class TestStringContext(val context: StringContext) {
      def x(args: Any*): Unit = {
        context.parts.foreach(part => println(part.getBytes("UTF-8").toList))
      }
    }
    x"""
      ${1}
    """
{noformat}

String interpolation eats carriage return

{noformat}
List(13, 10, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32)
List(10, 32, 32, 32, 32)
{noformat}

The first part starts with CRLF as expected, but the second part starts with LF only, CR is missing.
It happens only for the CR immediately following the right brace of an expression.

Workaround is to assign to a variable and use interpolated id $ident.
