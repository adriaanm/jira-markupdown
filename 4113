About intersection types not being simplified, I'll quote src/compiler/scala/reflect/internal/Types.scala:
{code}
/**** This implementation to merge parents was checked in in commented-out
      form and has languished unaltered for five years.  I think we should
      use it or lose it.
{code}
Moreover, as far as I see (mostly) from comments, there's no attempt to simplify the intersection of a class with its parents in method {{Types.intersectionType}}.
Anyway. I shall continue investigations later.
