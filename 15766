I have to open another ticket.  This is a duplicate of SI-2920 but I am forced to take a stand against this being ignored any longer.

I see failures like this too often to recount.  They are incredibly annoying.  The failed test will of course pass if I re-run it.  The failed test always involves actors.

The test suite bails out because of the failure and the stability test is not run.  I have to restart it and there goes another hour before I have results.  I am dealing with this almost daily for months and months and months.  Please can I get an opinion on what is going on here and what we can do about it.

I am on OSX snow leopard 10.6.4 using apple's jvm.  The machine is a mac pro with 2x4CPU.  It is a fairly sure bet the reason I am apparently the only one in the world seeing this is that nobody else habitually has multiple cores running the test suite simultaneously: or via some implementation quirk it may manifest on OSX and not linux.  All this means is that I am the canary in the coal mine: at the root of it there are going to be one or more concurrency bugs.
