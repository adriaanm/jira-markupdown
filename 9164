In general, I agree with not introducing new compilation errors in point releases and all of the compatibility concerns.  Perhaps the source compatibility situation is such that we never ever intend to change compiling code into non-compiling code.  However, I don't think the current behavior is the desired behavior 99% of the time and user-code that compiles because of this hides a bug.  If it were the other way, with the `ev` parameter selected, I'd agree that it should be left as is without question.  Since it is not, I think it should at least be considered to be a new warning (I'm don't like warnings and I don't like introducing warnings in a point release) if not an error.

I'm also guessing this behavior will change for 2.11, in which case I think it is even more important to keep too much code from relying on this.  Worst case, put it under `-Xfuture`.  I doubt many people will use the option, but at least I'll know about it!  This would mean `-Xfuture` needs to be reliable/supported and the behaviors it enables documented.  Maybe there just aren't any yet, but `-Xfuture  Turn on future language features.` doesn't seem to suggest it is expected to be used for production.
