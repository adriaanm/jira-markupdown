Sorry, should have taken more care with the ticket. I saw this behavior with:

- Linux
- JDK 1.6.0_14
- scala 2.7.7
- scala interpreter mode

The exact condition was I was running scala with a CLASSPATH generated by Ivy (which had resolved the symlinks to the raw filenames, causing the problem), and I saw this behavior whether I passed it in with the shell variable or -classpath option.

Based on above it sounds like bug already fixed at least as I saw it (in interpreter) fixed in 2.8 -- I searched fixed tickets but hadn't seen, maybe missed or fixed as a side effect of some other change?
