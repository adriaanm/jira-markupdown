All the correct combinations (and some incorrect as seen in the both examples above) were tested with the same result. The compiler does not get to the point to report any other errors.
{code}
package pkg1 {
    class C {
        private[pkg1] def foo: Int = 1
    }

    class T extends C {
        override def private[pkg1] foo = super.foo + 1
    }
}
{code}
