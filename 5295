I may be needing this in one of my projects. If you're still into adding a mutable.TreeMap to the standard Scala collections, I can do a PR to 2.12.x once (and if) I'm able to implement it :) Personally, I think a mutable sorted map is more than common enough to warrant appearing in the standard lib of a programming language.
