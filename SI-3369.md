An effect of this bug is that test `files/jvm/t3356.scala` does not always terminate automatically. The reason is that the linking actor does not check for `shouldExit` at the point in `react` where it suspends. This may result in lost exit signals from linked actors that terminate (they can signal between the linking actors initial `shouldExit` check at the beginning of `react` and before it suspends). One possible fix is to add a `beforeSuspending` hook method to `ReplyReactor`, calling it inside `searchMailbox` before suspending, and overriding it in `Actor` with a `shouldExit` check.
(In r21735) Closes #3369. Review by plocinic.
