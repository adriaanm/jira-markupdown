`scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable` taking type parameters seems unnecessary. Why not just have its `clone` method's return type be `this.type`?

A suggested replacement:

```scala
@cloneable
trait Cloneable {
	override def clone: this.type = super.clone.asInstanceOf[this.type]
}
```

Or, if it's really important to be able to customize the return type of `clone`:

```scala
@cloneable
trait Cloneable {
	type CloneType = this.type
	override def clone: CloneType = super.clone.asInstanceOf[CloneType]
}
```

I'm not sure if the existing `Cloneable` trait was done the way it was for a reason, though. I am but a humble programmer, offering a suggestion. :)

I realize it's probably too late to put this into 2.8 and replace `scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable` with this. But perhaps a future release could include this as a new `scala.Cloneable` trait and deprecate the other one.
