By what means are you trying to find out what already exists? Your hypothetical code works exactly as given and has for a while.
{code}
scala> val cities = List("London", "New York", "Paris", "Munich")
cities: List[java.lang.String] = List(London, New York, Paris, Munich)

scala> val grouped = cities.groupBy(_.length)
grouped: scala.collection.Map[Int,List[java.lang.String]] = Map(6 -> List(London, Munich), 8 -> List(New York), 5 -> List(Paris))
{code}
