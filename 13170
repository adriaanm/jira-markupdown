Currently, case class parameters are not documented by scaladoc. Since they are public `vals`, they should appear as fields of the class.

Additionally, there is no syntax to attach scaladoc comments for such fields. This can be annoying, so it would be nice if something like this worked:
```scala
case class Category(
  /** Categorization scheme */ scheme: String,
  /** User defined category */ value: String)
...
```

Currently, the above comments are ignored. It should not be very difficult to add, if the parser already recognizes them.
