Clicking hideall on the scaladoc of class Range gives a single type member WithFilter. This is wrong on two counts.

1. The type member should not be displayed -- it is not defined in class Range.

2, There are members defined in class Range which should be displayed.

It seems that currently hideall hides all term members. It should hide all inherited members instead.
(In r24339) [scaladoc] The "inherited" filter work correctly for inner classes and object. Closes #3775. No review.
