Can you elaborate on that? I introduced all the math context code, because it was pretty useless without the ability to specify it.  You can see in SI-1812 some talk about how to integrate it, with the other party in the discussion wanting it even more tightly integrated.  (And I'm not sure I disagree, I just haven't had time to come back to it.)
