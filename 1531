Should this be handled by the fix?
```scala
  @tailrec
  def retryOn[T](thCls: Class[_ <: Throwable], maxTimes: Int)(block: => T): T = {
    try block
    catch {
      case t: Throwable if thCls.isInstance(t) && maxTimes > 0 =>
        retryOn(thCls, maxTimes - 1)(block)
    }
  }
```

...because currently I'm getting a compile error.

It works when the guard is turned into {code}case ... => if (...) ... else throw t{code}
