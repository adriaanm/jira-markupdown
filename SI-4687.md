In scala REPL :
{code}
scala> None.foreach{ println("KO"); _.toString} }}
KO
{code}
I expected that nothing was printed, since None contains no value... The same result happens in a compiled project.

However, when the variable is named, it works :
{code}
scala> None.foreach{ x => println("KO"); x.toString}
{code}

It seems to come from the placeholder, but is it due to a bug in None or is it due to the scala transformation from a "lambda function" to a Function1 object ?

Same behaviour with map.
When is the block evaluated ? Because when I do that :
{code}
scala> def f: Any => Any = {println("ko"); _.toString }
f: (Any) => Any

scala> None.foreach(f)
ko
{code}

The result is the same... And the {{println}} is called in {{None.foreach}}.
