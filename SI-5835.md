This is obviously minor, and goes to name mangling improvement, but an $anonfun$bar$1 is printed as $anonfun|1 in -Xprint output.

The example was from #1386
```scala
def bar(g:(=>Any) => String, x:Int) = g(x)
```

Maybe TreePrinters can do a quick test for enmanglement, where the enmanglement is crosstalk between operators and ids.

Obviously, I still want my real bar operator to print correctly: $anonfun$|$1.
