The following code compiles but A cannot be instantiated nor subclassed.

{code}
class B
class A{ self:B => }
{code}

It might be nice to have a warning or error that A is useless
I assume you're saying the bug is that it compiles. It is true that
{code}
class A { self: B => } 
{code}
could be excluded when A and B are both classes and neither descends from the other. There might be some reason not to do it, but I can't think of one offhand.
