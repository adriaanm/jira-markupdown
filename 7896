I'm looking into fixing this, but it's a bit involved...

Technically, it depends on the granularity of the reachable entities you're considering.
The current implementation considers reachability per case, and `f('z')` will reach the case we think of as unreachable.

I'm trying to figure out how to consider reachability per alternative, but that's tricky to describe in general. What if you have several nested alternatives (inside other patterns) in one case?
