You're looking at 'x' but it has already been checked against null before the
equals call.

Here's the byte code:

Get the argument to the method and call getSuperclass() on it:
```scala
   0:   aload_1
   1:   invokevirtual   SI-18; //Method java/lang/Class.getSuperclass:()Ljava/lang/Class;
```

Store the supercalss in local variables 2 & 3 and leave it on the stack:
```scala
   4:   astore_2
   5:   aload_2
   6:   dup
   7:   astore_3
```

Now compare the result of getSuperclass() with null and leave the method if it is null:
```scala
   8:   ifnull  24
```

Now we know 'x' the superclass is not null.

Here's the odd part.  Load the superclass from local variable 3, put a null on the stack with
aconst_null and call x.equals(null), which always returns false.
```scala
   11:  aload_3
   12:  aconst_null
   13:  invokevirtual   SI-22; //Method java/lang/Object.equals:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
```
