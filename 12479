You know what, works perfectly with Scala.
I overlooked that my problem occurs in groovy when the scala-Int is used there.

e.g. MainGroovy.groovy

{code:java}
class MainGroovy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        println scala.Int.box(1)
    }
}
{code}

has the problem.

Here a running project reproducing the issue:

BTW:
Works perfectly well with scala 2.11.x
