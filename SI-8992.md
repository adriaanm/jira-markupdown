Scala 2.11 can't type this over night, but 2.10 runs quickly.

The exponential cascade of implicit searches is the result of the change introduced in https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3346.

When trying to resolve the overload for `infix_abs(Math,_arg0)`, scalac tries to see whether `def infix_abs[T:Arith](self: Rep[DenseVector[T]]): Rep[DenseVector[T]]` is applicable. It sees an implicit conversion from Tuple2 to Rep[DenseVector], and goes for it, packing Math and _arg0 into a tuple and then trying to typecheck the application of the said conversion (`implicit def tupleToDense2[A:Arith,B](t: Tuple2[A,B]): Rep[DenseVector[A]]`) to `(Math,_arg0)`.

What happens then is caused by the aforementioned bugfix. In 2.10.x, tupleToDense2 implicit candidate is triaged without resolving implicit arguments (the A: Arith context bound), whereas in 2.11.x typedImplicit1 is changed to resolve implicit arguments during triaging. Therefore in 2.11.x, the mere fact of considering tupleToDense2 as an implicit conversion, will launch an implicit search for Arith[A].

Now, a bunch of implicit methods provide Arith[Something], and, what's worse, triaging those implicit methods will cause other `Something: Arith` context bounds to be resolved, launching more and more implicit searches for `Arith[Something]`. That quickly gets out of hand.

Do you think it would be possible for you to restructure the code so that this avalanche of implicit lookups doesn't get spawned?
