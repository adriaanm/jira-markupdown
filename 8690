Reopening because this is still broken in 2.11.0-M4, and it is not really a duplicate of SI-6187 (which fix states that "we are not able to reify partial functions yet": 
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2011).

The issue here is the parent class (`AbstractPartialFunction[A, B]`) that disappears in the class definition of the reified partial class (or maybe the fact that that class is synthesized instead of keeping the Match in the reified tree, I have no clue which is best).

Quick way to reproduce:
```
scala
:power
reify({ case 0 => 0 }: Function1[Int, Int])
reify({ case 0 => 0 }: PartialFunction[Int, Int])
```
