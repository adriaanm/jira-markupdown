A wrapper that demonstrates a far more capable version the code in sys.process
permitting glob expansion and multiple shell arguments, etc. 
```scala
import sys.process._

object Shell {
  var debug: Boolean = false

  def apply(command: String): Shell = {
if (debug) println("Shell: " + command)
    new Shell(parse(command))
  }
  def apply(pb: ProcessBuilder): Shell = new Shell(pb)

  def parse(command: String): Seq[String] = {
    var parts = List.empty[String]
    parts = "/bin/bash" :: parts
    parts = "-c" :: parts 
    parts = command :: parts
    parts.reverse
  }
}
import Shell._
class Shell(val pb: ProcessBuilder) {
if (debug) println("Shell" + pb)
  def #| (other: Shell) : Shell = {
    val pb: ProcessBuilder = this.pb.#|(other.pb)
    new Shell(pb)
  }
  def #|| (other: Shell) : Shell = Shell(this.pb.#||(other.pb))
  def #&& (other: Shell) : Shell = Shell(this.pb.#&&(other.pb))
  def ### (other: Shell) : Shell = Shell(this.pb.###(other.pb))

  def !!  : String = this.pb.!!
  def !!< : String = this.pb.!!<

  def ! : Int = {
if (debug) println("command="+pb)
    pb.!
  }
  def !< : Int = {
if (debug) println("command="+pb)
    pb.!<
  }
}

// do not import sys.process here 
  implicit def stringToShell(command: String): Shell = Shell(command)

    "ls -l *.scala" !

    "ls -l *.scala" #| "wc -l" !

    "echo aa:bb:cc " #| "sed -e 's/:/ /g'" #| "wc -w" !
```
All of the "scripts" work just fine. 

Yea, I am assuming "/bin/bash" and I don't have all of the
other ProcessBuilder methods. They could be added I guess. 

But this approach allows ALL bash scripts to be used not just a some subset
of trivial scripts.
So, as it currently is, it is impossible to ask for the execution of a command supported by one shell but not other shell - that would be portable, anything else is not portable. Right?
So, as it currently is, it is not possible to have the script:
import util.Properties._
"/bin/rm " <ins>userHome </ins> "/.kderc" !
In that case, the current offering would be secure. But if the current offering does allow such code, then it is not secure.
Yes, things are not so easy are they?

The current implementation is neither portable nor secure;
what I suggest is simply more flexible.
If you believe the current implementation is just fine the way it is,
I don't want to argue. My wrapper is so obvious and useful I imagine that someone will simple create a github version of it and that will be that.
