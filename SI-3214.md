It would be cool if i can just select a part of an expression and the eclipse plugin to show the type of that part of the expression. 

Reason:

We're writing longer and longer expressions, now with map/filter/etc and sometimes get freaky type mismatches (usually some Products appear out of nowhere, as scala tries to come up with a type).

...the only solution is breaking it up in pieces and assign to some vals - just to see the resulting types to figure out my problem.
