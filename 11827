[~antoras] The mailing list thread doesn't really tackle the problem adequately.

One invariant you would expect from transpose (let's call it T for short) is that {{xs == T(T(xs))}}.  However, with the Haskell approach that invariant is violated.  So I really don't like that one.  I agree that there is value in a transpose-like method, maybe {{collapseByColumn}}, that does what Haskell does, but I don't think {{transpose}} is the name for it.

Now, I do think that transpose could should be able to handle any list that is in length-descending order; then the invariant is obeyed.  Is that change of value, do you think?
