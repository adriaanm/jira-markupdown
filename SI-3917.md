the code that causes the problem is:

            cmd & (JqId(new JsExp { def toJsCmd = "frobozz" })
                   ~> JqHtml(generate(tup._2))
                   ~> JqShow(100))

and the bug can be worked around:

            val html = JqHtml(generate(tup._2))
            cmd & (JqId(new JsExp { def toJsCmd = "frobozz" })
                   ~> html
                   ~> JqShow(100))

the method being called is:

  object JqHtml {
    def apply(content: NodeSeq) = new JsExp with JsMember with JQueryRight with JQueryLeft {
       ...
    }
 }

The compiler emits a call to  (Lscala/xml/NodeSeq;)Llibrary/JQueryRight;
which is incorrect, and should be (Lscala/xml/NodeSeq;)Llibrary/JsExp;

repro case is at http://github.com/Dridus/erasingwrongreturntype

run build.sh -- it will show the correct signature and incorrect call signature, and then blow up with the NoSuchMethodError

note that the code is separated because it needs to be to reproduce the bug -- if all the code is in one compilation unit it will not trigger.

this is as minimal as I have time to make it -- there may be extra cruft in Library.scala which is copy and pasted with some surgery from the appropriate Lift code

I have reproduced against 2.8.0.final and 2.8.1.RC2


yeah, I fubbed the formatting and intended to preview but instead submitted. here are the code blocks in a more palatable format:

broken code:
{code}
            cmd & (JqId(new JsExp { def toJsCmd = "frobozz" })
                   ~> JqHtml(generate(tup._2))
                   ~> JqShow(100))
{code}

code that works:
{code}
            val html = JqHtml(generate(tup._2))
            cmd & (JqId(new JsExp { def toJsCmd = "frobozz" })
                   ~> html
                   ~> JqShow(100))
{code}

Since I just minimized the hell out of this I'm closing this one as a duplicate of SI-3918.
