In 2.9.0, on SetLike:

{code}
  def ++ (elems: GenTraversableOnce[A]): This = newBuilder ++= seq ++= elems.seq result
{code}

So if I have code which does:
{code}
  aVeryVeryLargeSet ++ Nil
{code}

Adding multiple elements has just become an O(N) operation (or O(n)) because we always add all of the current Set, irrespective of how many new members we have. 

I believe that in  2.8.x this method was coming from TraversableLike and was using an implicit CanBuildFrom which was being given the current repr as a seed.



I also like the thumbs down.

Situation: ++ was modified to call .seq on the target set.  I defer to alex and assume this is required.  And then it's not clear to me how to fix this.  Because of the signature of ++, one would normally do it like this:

  new SetBuilder[A, This](repr) ++= elems.seq result

There is no "reprSeq" which creates a "sequential representation", so if we must call .seq, we lose the Repr/This and end up building a collection.Set[A].  But ++ returns This.

(extempore in [r25031|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25031]) Repaired regression in Set causing Set ++ to become very expensive.
Closes #4642, no review.
