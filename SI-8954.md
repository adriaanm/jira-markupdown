`@deprecatedOverriding` and `@deprecatedInheritance` are competely unaware of `@deprecated`. For example:

 - a {{@deprecated}} class extending a {{@deprecatedInheritance}} class warns about inheriting being deprecated,
 - a {{@deprecated}} member or a member of a {{@deprecated}} class overriding a member marked {{@deprecatedOverriding}} warns about overriding being deprecated.

This happens all over the collection library when a collection is about to be made final and the children removed or made private, which causes a lot of useless deprecation warnings (not that anybody looks at the warnings...).
