Got a crash when trying to autocomplete "Long.M<tab>" in the REPL. Restarted it and got the error again. After running ":reset" the error was gone, but I captured the stacktrace.

I have just fixed #7418, a crasher in tab completion just after startup.

I can't reproduce either of these problems.

I will close this ticket as 'Incomplete'. I you can reproduce, please post a REPL transcript (including version numbers) that demonstrates the problem.
