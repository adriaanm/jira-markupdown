As per http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627 , a JSON value is allowed to be various things. In particular it is not just an array or an object, which is all the current JSON parsing implementation allows at the outer level. The parser should correctly deal with top level instances of numbers, booleans, etc.

I'm confused. What does the current parser *not* parse that it should? My reading of the RFC says that the top-level element must either be an array or an object, and as far as I can tell, once you have that, anything can nest inside.
