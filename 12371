This is not the duplicate of https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8697.

The implicits whose order is changed in the file are NOT related, and have nothing in common with the implicit that is NOT being found.
Basically adding a new line with an implicit value AFTER the questioned file creates an error in the line before.
