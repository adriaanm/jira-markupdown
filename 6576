Cool, thanks for the explanation.

Are you able to update the specification to reflect that? (At least for the next version, if you're real conservative about changes.) I'm not sure where the source lives or where the copy on the website (http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf) comes from.
