re: Scaladoc processing Java sources, see scala/bug#4826. (it's good that it handles them even to the limited extent that it does, and ideally it would handle them even better!)

SBT can be told to ignore Java sources in its scaladoc generation task; see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8884866/sbt-doc-command-how-to-exclude-java-source-files
