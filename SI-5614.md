The interpretation of StringContext.s is strange when applied to the string literal `s"a\nb"`. According to SIP-11 (String Interpolation) the standard interpolation should replace every escape character sequence by the denoted character, therefore I expected a result of length 3.

```scala
scala> s"a\nb"
res0: String =
a\nb
b

scala> res0.length
res1: Int = 6
```
Fix:

Change (in method treatEscapes, line 146 of File StringContext.scala)
```scala
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr append str substring (start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
```

to

```scala
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr append str.substring (start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
```

Explanation: in the current version, `str` is appended to the buffer, and then on the buffer `substring` is called (which has no effect), i.e. without sugar: 
`bldr.append(str).subsring(start, cur)`
