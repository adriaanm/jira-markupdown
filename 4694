My proposal is to close this bug report. The bug originally reported has been fixed. It was not clear to me whether I can simply press the `close issue` button or whether some discussions have to be made somewhere.

Regarding the definition: Is it really defined in IEEE754? I just skimmed the spec, but did not find info about the machine epsilon, and on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon) I found the sentence
```
The IEEE standard does not define the terms machine epsilon and unit roundoff, so differing definitions of these terms are in use, which can cause some confusion.
```


I remember two definitions:

- the eps is defined to be the smallest float with the property 1+eps > 1. This definition leads to 5.960465E-8 (for float), or `1 100111 00000000000000000000001` in binary (or 2^(-24)*(1+2^(-23)))

- the eps is defined to bhe the largest float with the property 1+eps = 1. This definition leads to 5.960465E-8 as well, or `1 100111 00000000000000000000000` in binary (or 2^(-24)


So I really come to the conclusion that the Scala library should not define such a constant.
