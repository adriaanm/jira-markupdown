`Vector` is currently the default implementation returned by `IndexedSeq()`, but there is an argument to be made for making it the default `Seq()` as well.

When compared to requesting a `List` in an interface, when someone requests a `Seq` they are likely expecting a collection that has good general behavior for the most common operations: append/prepend. But by accepting a `Seq`, there is a high likelihood that what you get instead will be a `List`, meaning that your append performance will be linear. But furthermore, the `Seq` interface does not let you assume that your prepend performance will be good either, because you might have gotten an `ArrayBuffer` or some other collection with linear prepend.

Thus, to improve the average case (and make the default implementation of `Seq` as "generic" as the trait itself), `Vector` is a much better choice than `List`. Daniel Spiewak also makes [a great argument to this effect](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6934116).

 Sidenote: In an ideal world, it would probably be even better to swap the behaviors of the {{Seq}} and {{IndexedSeq}} traits, resulting in {{Seq}} and "{{UnindexedSeq}}".
