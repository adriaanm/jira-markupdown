Lately I've had several problems with Java code in Scala projects. There seems to be several problems relating to Java code seeing Scala code. Using nightly 2.8.0.r19784-b20091123020210, I coded the following on a new Scala project:

Foo.scala:
```scala
object Foo {
    def hello = println("Hello world")
}
```

Bar.java:
```scala
public class Bar {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Foo.hello(); // "Foo cannot be resolved"
    }
}
```

I've seen other similar issues, but this is the only one I have time to provide a test case for.
The problem is that the companion class (seen as Foo from Java) of the module (seen as Foo$$ from Java) and it's static forwarder methods aren't visible in Eclipse's model.

Expect a fix shortly, but as a temporary workaround you can use Foo$$.MODULE$$.hello() to refer to Foo.hello from Java.
(In r20628) Add static forwarders where required. Fixes #2686.
