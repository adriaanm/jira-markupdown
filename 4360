(In r24305) Rediscovering that transpose sometimes throws an exception on irregular
lists and sometimes returns an irregular result (depending on whether the
first collection is the longest or not) indicated that this needs a better
resolution than the status quo.  Determination: as long as we're throwing
an exception on any invalid input, we should throw an exception on all
invalid input, so that's what it does now.  I postpone any attempt to offer
a variation accepting a "hole value".  Closes SI-3597, review by community.
