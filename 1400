Ah.  Here is why the array is untyped:
```scala
Note that while this method returns an array of Constructor<T> objects (that is an array of constructors from this class), the return type of this method is Constructor<?>[] and not Constructor<T>[] as might be expected. This less informative return type is necessary since after being returned from this method, the array could be modified to hold Constructor objects for different classes, which would violate the type guarantees of Constructor<T>[]
```
Of particular note is that this is a consequence of java's covariant arrays and the rationale doesn't apply in scala.  At the very least it'd make sense for there to be a scala wrapper which performs the cast so scala users don't have to suffer the worst of both worlds.
