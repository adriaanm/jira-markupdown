Ok, after investigation, This is what I discovered:

Java only exposes clone (publicly) for specific collections.  You have to **know** the specific type to clone.  That's just not happening in our interface, so I went with my initial idea for cloning, added some tests for basic Set/Map/Collection/List.  Now, Collection doesn't expose clone either, so we may be ok here.

In any case, I'm opening a bigger ticket on clone behavior in collections as a whole.   I need to do more thorough cleanup work across collections and I think it'll fix these issues.
