If you read the documentation for Object, it says that equal should:
```scala
For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.
```
However, there is no way for the compiler to be sure that superclass is a non-null reference.  So I am not really sure what FindBugs thinks it is complaining about here.
