Note that that PR clarifies only what "printable character" in the text refers to.  (It doesn't address the fact that {{printableChar}} isn't actually specified in that chapter.)  (I know; it's my PR.)

Isn't the syntax summary supposed to be a _summary_--that is, isn't every grammar production listed in it supposed to be a copy of a production specified elsewhere?  (Isn't that the norm for language specifications?  It has been in those I've read and worked on.)
