Thanks, Jason, I will see what I can do. That class has a lot of inheritance of inner classes and traits from other files and packages, though, it will not be easy to reduce it.

My first priority will be to get working again, which means rolling back the IDE to 2.10.0, somehow. With SBT, changing the Scala version to 2.10.0-RC2 fixes the problem.
