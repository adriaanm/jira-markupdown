It would be useful if macro invocations could get a free pass on warnings before expansion.

That way, a build can run with warnings turned high and fatal, even if a macro does something like turn "a pure expression [that] does nothing in statement position" into a productive member of society, for example, by wrapping a boolean in an assert.

Perhaps enable it with `-Ymacro-no-warn`, and perhaps try to buffer the warnings and emit them if there are warnings after expansion. (The old warnings may or may not be meaningful for a given macro.)
Running into this in a project of mine. It runs a block of statements, and replaces it with the REPL output. Using this triggers warnings for pure statements (like literals) in positions other than the last statement.

Even something as simple as this triggers the decribed issue:

{code}
import scala.reflect.macros.whitebox._
import scala.language.experimental.macros

object Macros {
  def impl(c: Context)(x: c.Tree) = {
    import c.universe._
    q"()"
  }

  def foo(x: Any): Any = macro impl
}

object Test extends App {
  Macros.foo {
    1
    2
  }
}
{code}
Thanks for reopening.  I was faked out that day because the warning is emitted on {code}{ 2 == 1 }{code} but not on
{code}
{ val x = 1 ; 2 == x }
{code}
