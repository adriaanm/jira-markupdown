Just ran into this in a really subtle way:

{code:title=package.scala}
package foo
package object bar {
  def duh(n:Long) = println("long")
  def duh(n:Double) = println("double")
}
```scala

{code:title=main.scala}
package foo.bar
object Main {
  def main(args:Array[String]) {
    duh(33L)
    foo.bar.duh(33L)
  }
}
```

{code:title=output}
double
long
{code}

In the wild it takes a moment to notice that this is going on because the Long values will get coerced into Doubles. Currently scala.math would hit this bug in a big way if it needed to use its own functions (e.g. abs). I noticed this when writing a similar "math package".
