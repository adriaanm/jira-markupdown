So in Scala, it should be possible to define methods that no one can call? That's a rather odd goal.
As I've said before, I would prefer that the methods could actually be called, rather than ambiguity being determined by the first argument list only, but that is also not a goal.
So that leaves one with a rather odd situation of having methods that compile fine, and can be unambiguously referenced by any human, yet the Scala compiler, which has a general goal in other aspects to be smart, cannot.
