The JScience API has a variety of physical constants. See http://jscience.org/api/index.html for more. These are represented as Greek characters that require UTF-16 file encoding.  My understanding is that the scala compiler does not allow this character set but the Java compiler does.  Should Scala allow a larger character set?  If not, how should this issue be resolved?

A trivial code example that demonstrates this issue is:


{code}
package test

import org.jscience.physics.amount._

object JScienceProblem {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = 
    {
      //Change the 'c' to something Greek (mu, pi, etc.) to see the failure mode.
      println(Constants.c)
    }
}

{code}
