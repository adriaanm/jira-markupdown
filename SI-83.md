No error (works with scalac)
The interpreter is problematic in what concerns companion objects. Basically, you won't get a companion object when you define an object with the same name as a previously defined class. I don't see how to do this, either. Neither do I see what part of the spec is violated, as companion objects demand that object and class are in the same source file.
