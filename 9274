I spent a little time tinkering with this and found two issues:

# {{Ordering\[T\]}} defines methods {{max}} and {{min}}, which return {{T}} (in covariant position).
# {{Ordering\[T\]}} extends {{java.util.Comparator\[T\]}} which, having been defined in Java, is invariant in {{T}}.

The first problem seems easy to deal with. The second, though, well... I wish Scala could somehow infer correct variance for {{Comparator}}.
