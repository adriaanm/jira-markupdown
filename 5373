The by-name argument figures in: that overload works fine if neither uses => String.

Oddly, the following is unambiguous, when there's a much better case for it to be ambiguous than your example.
```scala
object Log {
  def log(m: => String) = println("1:"+m) 
  def log(m: String) = println("2:"+m)
}
```
