The following code shows that in some cases a by-name parameter is not
evaluated immediately:

{code}
scala> def f(block : => Unit) = { () => {println("calling block"); block } }
f: (=> Unit)() => Unit

scala> val g = f { println("doing work") }
g: () => Unit = <function>

scala> g()
calling block
doing work
{code}

It would be nice if the ScalaReference.pdf section 4.6.1 would add a
note on this indicating that this is the case.  I was reading the new
Scala book today and it used this to not immediately evaluate a by-name
parameter.
