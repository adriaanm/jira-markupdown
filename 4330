(In r22802) closes scala/bug#3575. stricter override checking for java members with default access: can only override such a member from the same package
cloneSymbol now preserves privateWithin -- need to reset it explicitly now when before it was assumed to be not to be carried over

rewrote accessibility in overriding checks so they're more readable, but hopefully with same semantics
