As of scala 2.10.3 the following doesn't work for me:
{code}
package a

class A {
  def nice() {}
  def nice(s: String) {
  }
}

class B {
  /**
   * A link to [[A.nice(String)]]
   * @see [[A.nice(String)]]
   */
  def ooh() {

  }
}
{code}

I get 

{code}
methodlink.scala:10: warning: Could not find any member to link for "A.nice(String)".
  /**
  ^
one warning found
{code}

Are method links a work in progress? Should I fill a bug report?

About the documentation..
How can you get the "Quick crash course" from the scaladoc tool? I couldn't find any command line option to trigger it.
It would also be nice to have a direct link to the documentation, but it seems it has not been written yet? 

Thanks
