With two classes:

JavaB.java--public class JavaB { public int i = 1; }

ScalaC.java--class ScalaC { val b = new JavaB() }

Causes the line "val b" to get a "JavaB does not have a constructor" error. Note that technically there are no real Problems, this is just a line error.

Making the error goes away requires manually changing JavaB (e.g. set i = 2), then manually changing ScalaC (e.g. rename val b to val c). Basically, incrementally compiling each file, then the "no constructor" error goes away.

Hitting clean build makes it come back.

I'm using r20428.
