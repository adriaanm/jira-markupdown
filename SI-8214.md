I was happy to get AnyRefMap as a faster version of HashMap. Sadly, it is not a drop-in replacement. I had several places where I inherited from HashMap, typically with something like this

{code}
    val myMap = new mutable.HashMap{T, Int] {
       override def default(key: T) = 0
    }
{code}

It is annoying to have to choose between fast defaults and a faster map implementation in general. I understand the argument for making AnyRefMap final, but I think it has gone too far. I think here we need to put coherence and flexibility of collections first, and just document that overriding certain protected operations internal to maps risks future version breaks.

Collections are so uniform everywhere else, that's one of their defining characteristics and contributes to no small degree to the good user experience. Making AnyRefMap an exception is a sore.


Is this sufficient?

{code}
scala> new collection.mutable.AnyRefMap[String, String](_.reverse)
res1: scala.collection.mutable.AnyRefMap[String,String] = Map()

scala> res1("1234")
res2: String = 4321
{code}
BTW, if we do really need to expose non-final versions of concrete collections, I would favour this pattern:

{code}
/** EXTEND AT YOUR OWN RISK! */
abstract class BaseAnyRefMap { ... }
final class AnyRefMap extends BaseAnyRefMap
{code}

By way of example, consider `AnyRefMap#getOrElse`

{code}
override def getOrElse[V1 >: V](key: K, default: => V1): V1 = {
    val i = seekEntry(hashOf(key), key)
    if (i < 0) default else _values(i).asInstanceOf[V]
  }
{code}

and compare with `MapLike#getOrElse` (which is inherited by the old, slow HashMap)

{code}
def getOrElse[B1 >: B](key: A, default: => B1): B1 = get(key) match {
    case Some(v) => v
    case None => default
  }
{code}

If `AnyRefMap` were not final, and we allowed you to override `get`, we could not optimize away the allocation of the `Some`.
