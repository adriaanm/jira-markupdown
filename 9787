In fact, consider {code}(1 to 10).maxBy{i => -i}{code} Here the function will be executed -10- 9 times for i=1 (the max).

Edit: To clarify, I agree with you. I'm pointing out that the closure is executed with *i=1* nine times in this example. It is not necessarily the case that all values of i are executed twice. This would be of interest for closures that have side-effects.
