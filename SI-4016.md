```scala
var a = 0
var b = 0L
a += (b >>> 32)
```

What is the expected behavior?

The code should either just work (like in Java) or result in 
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long
 required: Int
```


What do you see instead?
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long <: Any): ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2float in object Predef of type (x: Int)Float
 and method int2double in object Predef of type (x: Int)Double
 are possible conversion functions from Int to ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long <: Any): ?}
       var a = 0; var b = 0L; a += (b >>> 32)
                              ^
```


What versions of the following are you using?

Scala: 2.8.1 ||| Java: 1.7.0_106-icedtea ||| Operating system: Ubuntu 10.10
Wow, java lets you do that? That's kind of frightening.

You don't need to get all bitshifty, this is enough.
```scala
scala> var a = 0
a: Int = 0

scala> a += 1L  
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(1L) <: Any): ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2long in object Predef of type (x: Int)Long
 and method int2float in object Predef of type (x: Int)Float
 are possible conversion functions from Int to ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(1L) <: Any): ?}
       a += 1L
       ^  
```
The suggested message by the way is not correct.
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long
 required: Int
```
An Int is not required.  Many types are possible, as described (opaquely) in the given error:
```scala
?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(1L) <: Any): ?}  
```
So it's not entirely obvious how to characterize the error.  Heuristics not so popular in these parts.
Hi extempore,

I suggested maybe returning

```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long
 required: Int
```

because this is what gets returned by 
```scala
var a: Int = 0
a = 1L + a
```

But I might be wrong.
Basically my comment was not on this part, which doesn't look beginner friendly but is probably correct:
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(1L) <: Any): ?}
```

But the (bogus?) message about the conversions to floating point numbers:
```scala
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2float in object Predef of type (x: Int)Float
 and method int2double in object Predef of type (x: Int)Double
[...]
```

I just felt a bit uneasy that the compiler even considered something with flaoting points when only doing integer math...

It's confusing for sure, but it's accurate as far as the compiler knows, and it's in the zone of difficult change.  The error is encountered when it is still trying to type the + expression.  Naturally it's going to go look for implicit conversions before it gives up, and there are conversions called int2double and int2long in Predef, and they are ambiguous in the narrow context of the expression it is typing.

Now were those implicits unambiguous, it would only kick the error further downfield a little ways, so you don't need to worry it's randomly resorting to FP math when it gets confused.  Compare these outcomes.
```scala
scala> (1 + 2L): Int 
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(2L) <: Any): ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2double in object Predef of type (x: Int)Double
 and method int2float in object Predef of type (x: Int)Float
 are possible conversion functions from Int(1) to ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(2L) <: Any): ?}
       (1 + 2L): Int
        ^

scala> (1d + 2L): Int 
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Double(3.0)
 required: Int
       (1d + 2L): Int
           ^

```

No, the addition is done and gone when that message is emitted.  It is saying you can't assign a Long to an Int.  Like this.
```scala
scala> 1L: Int
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long(1L)
 required: Int
       1L: Int
       ^
```
An Int really is required when you have a variable and it's an Int.
```scala
scala> var x: Int = 1L
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long(1L)
 required: Int
       var x: Int = 1L
                    ^
```
But an Int is not required when you are just looking for something to which you can add a Long, so we can't say "required: Int."
