Hello all!

I have noticed that the following piece of code yields a `StackOverflowError`. It involves invoking a `reduceRight` method on a (fairly) big array:

```scala
object Test {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    val arr = new Array[Int](10000)
    arr(5000) = 1
    arr (9000) = 2
    val sum = arr.reduceRight(_ + _)
    println(sum)
  }
}
```

I believe that the problem is the implementation of a private method `foldr` in the `scala.collection.VectorLike`:

```scala
  private def foldr[B](start: Int, len: Int, z: B, op: (A, B) => B): B = 
    if (start == len) z
    else op(this(start), foldr(start + 1, len, z, op))
```

This method is implemented using a recursion, one which seems not to be tail-optimized. I have observed this problem both in 2.7.5, and in 2.8.0 nightly. I recommend reimplementing it using a `foreach`.
Thanks for submitting a patch.

However, note that there is a bug in the `foldr` function in the attached patch: in the body, `foldr` is called recursively passing `end - 1` as first and `start` as second parameter. This means the recursive invocation will access `this(-1)`. Using the patched function the provided test case computes 0 instead of 3.

Fixed in r19183 (trunk). Test in `test/files/run/t2446.scala`.
