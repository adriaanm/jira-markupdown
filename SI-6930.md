Because it is absent from {{GenTraversableOnce}} (yet not from {{TraversableOnce}}), {{reduceLeft}} does not seem to have a documentation string.

Yet, it is referred to directly in the documentation string of {{reduceLeftOption}}. To quote:

{{reduceLeftOption}}
{quote}
Optionally applies a binary operator to all elements of this collection or iterator, going left to right.
...
*return*  an option value containing the result of reduceLeft(op) is this collection or iterator is nonempty, None otherwise.
