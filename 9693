I don't think https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2604 was merged, and I can't find a follow up PR.
Rescheduling for 2.11.1-RC1, but feel free to fix my oversight, note the PR that fixes this and mark it as fixed.
Please use the same approach as in scala/bug#7629,  where issues correspond to work items, so that we can close the issue that corresponds to a PR when it's merged. This is the only way we stand a chance at keeping jira in synch with github.

I think these warnings are really important, so I just want to make sure we don't forget about them / include them properly in the release notes.
