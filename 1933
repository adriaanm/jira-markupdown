I'm still stuck on this.  Here are my steps to reproduce:

 * installed Eclipse 3.5.RC3
 * installed Scala plugin 2.8.0.r17796-b20090522022040 from a downloaded jar
 * created a new Scala project in a new workspace added a hello world class - compiled and ran fine.
 * upgraded to latest plugin from the nightly update site and tried to do clean build - fails to compile with the exception reported
 * reverted to the previous configuration - able to clean build and run once again

It's clearly a class loading problem.  If I re-revert to the latest nightly and use `-Xbootclasspath/a:` to append `scala-library.jar` to the boot strap class path I can get it to work again.
