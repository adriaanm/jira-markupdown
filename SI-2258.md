AFAICT scaladoc is implemented in Linux as a script that launches scalac with a -doc option:

exec ${JAVACMD:=java} ${JAVA_OPTS:=-Xmx256M -Xms16M}  -classpath $SCALAC_CLASSPATH scala.tools.nsc.Main -doc "$@"

however, this fails with a rather unhelpful message:

scalac error: bad option: '-doc'
  scalac -help  gives more information

scalac -help does indeed confirm that no -doc option is to be had.

I have tried to modify the script removing the -doc option, but that does little good, as it simply compiles the *.scala sources into .class classes (but no doc to be had anywhere).

What gives?
Indeed!

The most embarassing part of it being that I **did** have scala-2.7.5.final downloaded on my machine, but assumed that (given that the version in the deb distro was the same) there should not be an issue there.

Thanks for **extremely** quick reply (and on a Saturday :-)
