Trying to compile LMS with virtualized M4. The branch in question is here:
https://github.com/Stivo/virtualization-lms-core/branches/delite-develop-m4

The stack trace of the compiler is at the very end of the file.
probably in here:
```scala
// only under -Yvirtualize: setter-rewrite has been done above, so rule out methods here, but, wait a minute, why are we assigning to non-variables after erasure?!
if (varsym.isVariable || (phase.erasedTypes && varsym.isValue && !(opt.virtualize && varsym.isMethod))) {
```

specifically: `!(opt.virtualize && varsym.isMethod)`
