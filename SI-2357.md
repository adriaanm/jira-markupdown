When using a 2.8.0 snapshot from 11 September combined with Hibernate JPA annotations like javax.persistence.Column I am experiencing some strange behaviour depending on how I name my variables.

@Column(name="ISO_CODE", nullable=false, length=4)
@BeanProperty var isoCode: String = _

yields a :

org.hibernate.MappingException: Repeated column in mapping for entity: ... MyClass column: ISO_CODE (should be mapped with insert="false" update="false")

Changing the variable to name to :

@BeanProperty var whateverCode; String = _

solves the problem.

Essentially 'is*' fails.

Hi Ross,

I don't now what the problem is, but I have a suspicion: the field
```scala
class A {
  @Column(...) @BeanProperty var isoCode = "dlfk"
}
```
generates
```scala
class A {
  @Column(...) private[this] var isoCode = "dlfk"
  @Column(...) def isoCode = this.isoCode
  @Column(...) def isoCode_=(s: String) = this.isoCode = s
  @Column(...) def getIsoCode() = isoCode
  @Column(...) def setIsoCode(s: String) = isoCode = s
}
```

The `@Column` annotation is copied to every getter / setter (this will change soon). Now: Hibernate looks for bean getters, i.e. methods starting with `get` or `is`. For each getter it analyzes the `@Column`. Since there are two such methods with the same `@Column` it yields an error.

Let's try again when the way annotations are copied (or not) around can be controlled (hopefully soon).

Cheers
