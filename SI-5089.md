This example is really weird
```scala
class O {
  def +(x: O): O = null
}
object O {
  implicit def i2o(x: Int): O = null
}
object M {
  val o : O = null
  1 + o //1.+(o) won't compile
}
```
This shouldn't compile in both cases. According to language specification implicit scope for e.v(args) is type of e. Here type of e is Int, so i2o can't be in implicit scope.
So this is possibly bug of lang specification, I mean implicit scope actually is bigger then Int.
However anyway it's compiler bug, because both exmples should be the same (infix operations is just syntactic sugar).

I'll leave this open for the spec update, but there's no bug in the example.  In "1.+(o)", "1." is a double.
```scala
scala> 1 + 2
res0: Int = 3

scala> 1.+(2)
res1: Double = 3.0
```
Ok, thank you, that wasn't obvious.
However maybe such syntax should be removed (I think 1d is enough)
For example, why these two calls are different?
```scala
class RichInt {
  def +++ = 1
  def foo = 2
}
implicit def i2r(x: Int): RichInt = new RichInt
1.+++
1.foo
```
So 1.id should be call to Int id, or should be Doudle id call in both cases.
(extempore in [r25985](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25985)) Deprecated ambiguous dot syntaxes.

1.+(2) - what is it? Is it 3 or 3.0? Come scala 2.11 you won't
have to not know (or even not know there's something you don't know.)
1.+(2) will then be safely considered equivalent to 1 + 2, because
any dot not followed by a digit is not part of a number.

Primarily, that's these forms:    3.f 3.d 3.

If you prefer an error to a warning, use -Xfuture.

Let's deprecate 012 == 10 too! (See comment.) References #5089, no review.
