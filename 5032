I believe this one might be related to specialization. Tuple2 isn't nested anyway so I don't think any of the nested objects changes are the culprit. For example just try in repl:
```scala
> (1,3)
> (1,3)
```
and you get the crash. Without specialization everything works fine.
In r23595 adapt now handles nested objects as Martin pointed out this bug.

Iulian, any comments? Also see scala/bug#4034, where it seems that specialization is broken for resident compiler.
