I just want to make clear that I wasn't specifying "-Dfile.encoding" or anything like that. Java has determined on its own that "Cp1252" is the default encoding on my platform. And Scala has determined on its own that "UTF8" is the default encoding. So the issue has nothing to do with me specifying any properties. Rather, it has to do with the mismatch between what Java and Scala assume for the default encoding.
