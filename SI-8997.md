This doesn't work:
```scala

        type SerializableList[T <: Serializable] = List[T]

        scala> case class NetworkDataCC(things: SerializableList[_])
        <console>:9: error: type arguments [_$1] do not conform to type SerializableList's type parameter bounds [T <: Serializable]
      
```

But this works:

```scala

       scala> type SL = SerializableList[_]
      defined type alias SL

      scala> case class NetworkDataCC(things: SL)
      defined class NetworkDataCC

```

You can also workaround it using high-order type:

```scala
 
     case class NetworkDataCC[SerializableList[_]](things: SerializableList[_])

```

It's reproducing for case classes only.
This also works:

```scala
case class NetworkDataCC(things: SerializableList[_ <: Serializable])
```
Here's a non case class reproduction:

```scala
object Test {
  type SerializableList[T <: Serializable] = List[T]
  class C(val sl: SerializableList[_])
  def unapply(x: C): Unit = Some.apply(x.sl)
}
```

I think redeclaring the bound is the right approach with Scala's current existential implementation. We've tried a few alternatives (see #1786), but haven't found a robust way to avoid that boilerplate.
Marking as a duplicate of #1786
