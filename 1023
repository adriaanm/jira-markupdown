We need to thread carefully wrt to EmptyPackage. There are some very subtle conventions which most people are unaware of> EmptyPackage is different form Root.
Classes in the empty package can be seen only from other classes in the empty package, never from classes in some other package. This is there to avoid unpleasant surprises
due to junk classes in the empty package. Java behaves the same way, I believe.
