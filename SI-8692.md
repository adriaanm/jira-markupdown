Note the wildcards in the following return types:

```scala
scala> Seq(0).view
res20: scala.collection.SeqView[Int,Seq[Int]] = SeqView(...)

scala> Seq(0).view :+ 1
res21: scala.collection.SeqView[Int,Seq[_]] = SeqViewA(...)

scala> Seq(0).view ++ Seq(1)
res22: scala.collection.SeqView[Int,Seq[_]] = SeqViewA(...)
```

There is no reason this shouldn't know the type.  In particular, it means that appending via a mutable variable doesn't work in the obvious way (i.e. var c = Seq(0).view; c = c :+ 1).
