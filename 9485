I've added a PC test that exercises exactly the problematic behavior in files/test/presentation/t1207(.check|/), in the branch investigation/SI-7362 [here|https://github.com/huitseeker/scala/tree/investigation/SI-7362]. I'ts created on top of 9094822181c398b945b7f30ac1e2b05da9796f53, with an update of sbt on top.
