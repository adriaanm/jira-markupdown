The traditional advice on deprecation warnings is to pipe it through a deprecated something that doesn't warn.  

Retronym has suggested deprecating a trait, implemented by its companion, and use the module method.

I have suggested deprecating a local function that forwards the call, to the same effect.

Edit: deprecated locals loophole was closed in 2.11.0-M8.
