This is related to Bug SI-9830, which in  fact derives from this. This is the code 

import scala.concurrent._
import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
val f: Future[Int] = Future {
  val source = scala.io.Source.fromChars(("x" * 7000000).toArray)
  source.toSeq.indexOfSlice("teetotal")
}

Per the referenced bug, the stuff inside the Future {...} never completes, so of course the future never returns; typing 'f' in the REPL brings up this:

res0: scala.concurrent.Future[Int] = List()

because it's unfinished. What's odd is if you type 'f' a few more times, it returns the same "I'm not finished" result ever more slowly, and after ~15 seconds it stops returning anything at all. 
IOW it seems the thread that spawns the future is hanging. The computing thread is taking up near 100% of cpu but not all of it (rest of my machine is fairly responsive) so the spawning thread has enough cpu to reply to my entering 'f', but it locks up. 
Should this happen?


See my remarks on SI-9830. Start in other fora, come to JIRA once you're sure there's a bug and specifically where the bug is.
