This looks like a bug in Scalatest's assert macro.

/cc [~cheeseng]

Here's a minimal reproduction:
```
% tail build.sbt test.scala
==> build.sbt <==
scalaVersion := "2.11.2"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.2.1"

==> test.scala <==
import org.scalatest._

class PossibleScalacBug {
  import DiagrammedAssertions._
  assert(new Object() == "")
}

% sbt compile
