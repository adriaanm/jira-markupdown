Right now (scala 2.8 nightly) it is impossible to have a default argument for pass-by-name parameters. E.g. the following code
```scala
def f(a: => Int = 10) = 1
```
produces error:
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(10)
 required: => Int
       def f(a: => Int =10) = 1
                        ^
```
But there is no way to specify something of type "=>Int" currently.
