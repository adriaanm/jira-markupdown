I'd suggest starting a mailing list thread on this, and if you can gather some consensus on whether some change would be desirable, then come back to JIRA. `filterOrElse` is working as designed.

I'm closing the ticket, but I don't mean to dismiss your concern. See how the mailing list thread goes. (I already have some things in mind I will say on that thread if you start it.)
