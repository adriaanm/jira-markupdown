I just did a svn checkout of you project and I see no errors in the file Asn1ParserBase.scala. Do those errors appear after a Clean and auto-build? If this is the case then this is probably a duplicate of scala/bug#2689.

BTW thank you for you interest in improving SDT by submitting a bug report. Bug reports are always helpful, but they are more helpful if they provide a specific way to reproduce the bug using a small self-contained code example. For example see scala/bug#2689, the code provided is minimal and has no dependencies so the developers can easily see the problem or use the provided code in a test case.

It would be extremely helpful, if this bug is not a duplicate of scala/bug#2689, if you could find the smallest example that reproduces the misbehavior that you have observed.
