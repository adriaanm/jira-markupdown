This:
{code}
Seq(Seq(1,2), Seq(3), Seq(4,5)).transpose
{code}

produces this:
{code}
List(List(1, 3, 4), List(2, 5))
{code}

If I had to implement transpose, this is how I would do it if I couldn't just fail.  I don't know if this behavior is ever actually desired, though, so perhaps transpose should throw an exception on irregular matrices.  SI-3399 might be related.
