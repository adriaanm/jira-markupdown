This:
```scala
Seq(Seq(1,2), Seq(3), Seq(4,5)).transpose
```

produces this:
```scala
List(List(1, 3, 4), List(2, 5))
```

If I had to implement transpose, this is how I would do it if I couldn't just fail.  I don't know if this behavior is ever actually desired, though, so perhaps transpose should throw an exception on irregular matrices.  scala/bug#3399 might be related.
