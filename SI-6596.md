the pickler "localizes" a refinement class's owner,
so when a refinement type is loaded from pickled information the owner structure will be different than when it's type checked from source

the following will demonstrate this, assuming you log the creation of RefinedTypes:

```scala
  final class RefinedType0(parents: List[Type], decls: Scope, clazz: Symbol) extends RefinedType(parents, decls) {
    println("RefinedType"+(clazz.ownerChain, parents, decls)) // logging
```

```scala
// A.scala
package test

trait A
trait C

trait B { self: A with C => 
  class Inner {
    def b = B.this
  }
}
```

```scala
// Impl.scala
package test

class Impl extends B with A with C
```

```scala
scalac A.scala Impl.scala > all
scalac Impl.scala > single
diff -u all single
```

yields (snipped)

```scala
-RefinedType(List(test, package test, package <root>),List(test.B, test.A, test.C),Scope{
+RefinedType(List(B, trait B, package test, package <root>),List(test.B, test.A with test.C),Scope{
```
I believe this bug was caused by the fix for #2323.

We need owners for refinement types since we must be able to check that outer-this references in its decls refer to an enclosing class (I tried removing the owner to see what breaks). We shouldn't, however, be rewriting owners during pickling. See my comments at #2323
I agree this would fix the symptoms we're seeing, but I suspect discrepancies between pickled symbols and information derived from typing source directly will keep causing trouble. In fact, in addition to this ticket it has caused the following regressions: #2741, #4079. 

I believe we should fix this properly in 2.11. For older releases SBT will indeed have to deal with the status quo. If we judge the pickler by (non-existent) specification complexity, this rewrite adds complexity. If we keep it, it must be properly documented.

Having two owner structures seems unnecessary[*] and risky: the "correct" one when we were typing from source, and the "localized" one for unpickled symbols. It seems to me SBT/IDE/Reflection/... will all need to consider both possibilities.

[*] Is there another reason besides #2323 for this localizedOwner rewrite? (There's also this hotfix for building lift on 2.7.6: http://github.com/scala/scala/commit/44e60b3ae6)

Poking around showed that anonymous function symbols were not considered "local" and references to them were thus pickled as external. Is this intended? I think pickling anonymous functions symbols as local/internal fixes #2323.

Finally, I think StubSymbol was a mistake. When you remove the localizedOwner rewrite in master, everything still works, but only because now we're silently creating these stub symbols left and right to deal with anonymous owners that cannot be found. Of course this will still blow up, albeit later and more opaquely: #6640.
I have a [REPL transcript](https://gist.github.com/4061123) that shows you can access RefinedType through reflection. Also, it shows that you can detect the difference in the owner chain for symbol corresponding to RefinedType.

At the moment if you obtain owner for RefinedType coming from tree type-checked by toolbox you'll get `NoSymbol`. I believe this is a bug in toolboxes (because with regular type-checker you get real owner assigned). However, the point is that even if toolbox get fixed to return the correct symbol that the type-checker assigns it'll be still different from the one unpickler creates. The reason for that is owner rewriting done in pickler.

I think pickling/unpickling must be an identity function.

$ cat Foo.scala 
object test3 {
  trait A; trait C
  trait B { self: A with C => 
    class Inner {
      def b = B.this

  }

In the same PR, I've added tests to show what `StubSymbol` achieves. The ends are very worthwhile, are there other means?
There's something deeply wrong with owners and refined types. I mean, it is fundamentally a problematic design because the owner of a refined type does not really make sense. But we need it to satisfy a lot of other invariants.

My strong advice would be to do as little as you can. I am convinced there is no satisfactory fix given the current compiler architecture. So when something is messy, better stirr up as little as possible! Inconsistencies in toolboxes are no reason to lose time over this. Just ignore the owner when computing the SBT hashes and you will be fine.

See related discussion about refinement owners in #8177.

;tl;dr: CompoundTypeTrees in the tpts of constructor parameters give rise to refinement class symbols owned by the classes owner. These are copied verbatim into the type of the associated accessor method. Subsequent attempts to `asSeenFrom` from this refinement class fail to substitute type parameters of the enclosing class, as the owner chain of the refinement suggests that is is not in scope. I suspect that similar problems could arise in joint/separate compilation as a result of the behaviour described above.

Reopening so we can re-assess for 2.12
I guess #7736 is somewhat related as well.
