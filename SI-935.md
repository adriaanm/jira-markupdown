when using class {{E}} as annotation, the type checker does not complain about {{B}} not conforming to {{String}}. The line which is commented out gives an error message as expected.

{code}
object Test3 {
  class E[T <: String](s: T) extends Annotation
  class B
  //val a = new E[B](new B)
  @E[B](new B) val b = "hi"
}
{code}
it's still broken for type annotations:

{code}
object Test3 {
  class E[T <: String](s: T) extends Annotation
  class B
  val b: String @E[B](new B) = "hi"
}
{code}
