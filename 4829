It's not a matter of explanation. This one test case passes, but I see no relationship of the code to the spec. So how do we know it's correct? In fact I tend to believe it isn't (but I did not have the time to figure out a counterexample either, sorry).

To explain: Protected is very subtle, and we can not hope to even approximate to have enough tests for it now. The best course of action is to do what's in the spec.
