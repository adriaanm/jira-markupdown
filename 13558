Originally I filed the invalid bug 723 because I thought the problem was specifically with static classes. I now have an example (attached) that reproduces the problem with only one scala file and two referenced jars (and one java file for comparison).

Specifically, the scala version is unable to reference the addProperties method and buildSessionFactory method of org.hibernate.cfg.AnnotationConfiguration from the included hibernate-annotations.jar while the equivalent java code is able to do so. Note that these methods do show up if you expand the jar file in the Referenced Libraries folder in the project, but they do not show up (along with a number of others) if you try to use code completion on the cfg variable.

Using the latest nightly of the eclipse plugin.
