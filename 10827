I think the first part of the request dups scala/bug#8265.

BTW, [~garillot] has a jenkins job that typechecks a few projects with  `-Xsource:2.10`. https://jenkins.scala-ide.org:8496/jenkins/view/Scala%20Xsource%20flag%20nightlies/

We know that we don't have the resources to be completely bug-compatible with 2.10 under this flag, so we are relying on the data from these builds to figure out where we get the most bang for our buck.

The primary use case for this flag is to use the 2.11 IDE for 2.10 code bases.
