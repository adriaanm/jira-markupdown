Isolated:
```scala
trait Equalizer[T]
trait Gen[A]

class Broken {
  implicit def const[T](x: T): Gen[T] = ???
  implicit def convertToEqualizer[T](left: T): Equalizer[T] = ???

  def in(a: Any) = ()
  in {
    import scala.Left
    "" == ""
  }
}
```

Paul pointed out in another ticket that the fact the `AnyRef#==` overloads, rather the overrides `Any#==` is pretty suspicious. You would not be allowed to compile real classes with those signatures as they collapse into an overriding relationship after erasure.
