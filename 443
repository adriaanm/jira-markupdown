(In r23380) Some uninteresting code related to error messages, which I'm
checking in mostly because I booted the r23379 commit in a git-svn
meltdown and posterity demands the message, which was:

You can now use the self-type of an anonymous class as a singleton
type in a pattern match ON THE MOON.  Actual test case excerpt:

  val x4 = new { self =>
    def f(x: Any) = x match {
      case _: x1.type     => 1
      case _: x2.type     => 2
      case _: x3.type     => 3
      case _: self.type   => 4
      case x: Dingus.type => x.IamDingus
    }
  }

Closes scala/bug#576, no review.
