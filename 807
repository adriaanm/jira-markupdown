Have you checked that in the second case (ie. when you add your Click class to the existing project) that a class file is actually created?

I very strongly suspect that your issue is somewhere else, and the ctrl-click failure is just a symptom.

BTW, please try again with tomorrow's nightly ... it's possible that today's fix for SI-1165 has had an effect.
