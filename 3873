Hi,

I believe the error is in library/scala/collection/Iterator.scala line 826
```scala
(howMany > 0 && len > gap)
```
seems to miss the initial condition. According to the comment 
```scala
// if 0 elements are requested, or if the number of newly obtained
// elements is less than the gap between sequences, we are done.
```

is used to test if we are done. But if we take a very small size and a very big step len will never be greater than gap.

A diff showing what I believe to be a first workaround is attached. (I am explicitly testing for this run to be the initial)

In my test it worked well enough, although somebody who has been doing Scala for more than 3 weeks can probably code a more elegant solution. There may be an opportunity to just fiddle with gap and len that I am missing right now.
