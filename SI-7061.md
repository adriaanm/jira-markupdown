When starting REPL having set 

**C:\>set JAVA_OPTS=-Djline.WindowsTerminal.directConsole=false**

jline still uses direct console mode. 

My fix was to make a small change to scala.tools.jline.WindowsTerminal such that the absence of \\ **-Djline.WindowsTerminal.directConsole** is the equivalent of \\ **-Djline.WindowsTerminal.directConsole=true** rather than it being \\ **-Djline.WindowsTerminal.directConsole=false** \\ and then to honor the setting less conditionally in the code. 

Interestingly the version of jline in sbt does not seem to have this problem.
