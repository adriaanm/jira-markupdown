I get an error when importing a private object member:

{code}
package z {
trait L {val x = 1}
object O {private val x = 2}

class C extends L {
 def f = {
 import O._
 println(x)
 }
}
}

{code}
test.scala:8: error: reference to x is ambiguous;
it is both defined in trait L and imported subsequently by 
import O._
 println(x)
         ^
one error found

Note if I move the import O._ outside the function f, everything compiles


It's almost a duplicate of SI-3160, but the overlap isn't 100%.  I bet they'll share a commit though.
Oh, it's totally a duplicate of SI-2133.  I knew it was in there somewhere.
