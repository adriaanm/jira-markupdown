Without the pattern matcher:

{code}
class A

case object B extends A

object Test {
  val x1 = (B: A)

  println(x1 == B)
  println(B == x1)

  val x2 = (B: A with Product)

  println(x2 == B)
  println(B == x2) // spurious warning
}

{code}
Things go awry here:

{noformat}
args = List(Test#20.this.x2#9255)
underlyingClass(args.head.tpe) = Test#9258 // RefinementClassSymbol
receiver = object B#14 // ModuleClassSymbol
receiver isSubClass actual = false
{noformat}
Paul, assigning to you since it's not directly pattern matcher related (if I read Jason's comment correctly).

Yep, pattern matcher isn't culpable.

I should have noted that {{receiver.tpe <:< actual.tpe = true}}, but things seem a bit roundabout, and I have a feeling this check is pretty subtle, so I'm not sure if that's right way to go.
