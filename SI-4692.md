implicit doesn't work in case of type-aliases:

{code}
class TypeAliasVsImplicitTest {

    class For[m[_], a](x: m[a]) {
       def map[b](y: a => b): m[b] = throw new Error
    }
    implicit def toFor[m[_], a](x: m[a]): For[m, a] = new For[m, a](x)

    trait MyList[A]

    def foo(xs: MyList[Int]) = xs.map(x => x) // compiles fine.

    type MyListOfInt = MyList[Int]
    def bar(xs: MyListOfInt) = xs.map(x => x) // doesn't compile: value map is not a member of TypeAliasVsImplicitTest.this.MyListOfInt
}
{code}
finally we suffer from recklessly changing the search for implicit conversions to use the narrow type of the convertee (xs.type) rather than the widened one (MyListOfInt)!

the problem was that unification in type constructor inference wasn't set up to deal with types that need to be widened *and* dealiased
(moors in [r25092|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25092]) closes #4692: unification in type constructor inference now widens *and* dealiases when necessary

in 2.8.1 implicit conversion search started with a widened type, so that combo never came up
