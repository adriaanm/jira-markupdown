Partest on Snow Leopard finds a 32-bit {{libnatives.jnilib}} rather than a 64-bit one, causing general unhappiness:
{code}
  [partest] java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Users/cunei/distrib/installer/dependencies/scala/test/files/jvm/libnatives.jnilib:  no suitable image found.  Did find:  /Users/cunei/distrib/installer/dependencies/scala/test/files/jvm/libnatives.jnilib: mach-o, but wrong architecture
{code}

The fix involves generating a "fat" universal mach-o library which contains both 32 and 64-bit code: the two can be built separately, then assembled using the {{lipo}} tool.
I am filing a ticket about it so that it is not forgotten (it's not tested by Hudson).
