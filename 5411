I've been seeing this same symptom for a couple of days.
I finally tracked it down to a bad entry in /etc/hosts (specifically, while running scala scripts on 'myhost' with an /etc/hosts entry 'myhost 1.2.3.4', where 1.2.3.4 was incorrect).
The fix was to comment out the /etc/hosts entry (or correct it).  Strangely, the only problem was with scala, lots of other stuff (apache2, etc.) has been working fine for months.

The following program is useful for diagnosing this problem.  If it reports an incorrect IP address for the host, scala.tools.nsc.CompileServer will try to connect to the bogus host address:

    object InetLocalhost {
      def main(args:Array[String]){
        printf("%s\n",java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost())
      }
    }

Even if the bogus address is to a server running the scala compile server, the port address would almost certainly be incorrect, resulting in the failed connection problem.

Hopefully, this comment will help other hapless souls with this type of misconfiguration.
