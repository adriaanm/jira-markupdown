We are seeing a similar issue in Scala 2.9.x. We have a base trait in which we have fields decorated with JAXB annotations. Derived classes which mix-in this trait are (un)marshalled correctly by JAXB in Scala 2.8.1, but not in Scala 2.9.0 or Scala 2.9.1 There is some discussion of this issue -- with sample code -- on the Scala Google groups list here:
