Section 6.7.1 ("Method Values") in the language spec says: 

bq. Example 6.7.1 The method values in the left column are each equivalent to the anonymous functions (ยง6.23) on their right. 
{noformat}
List.map2(xs, ys)_     x => List.map2(xs, ys)(x) 
{noformat}

But I don't think this expansion is correct.  6.7 says "e _ represents e 
converted to a function type by eta expansion (ยง6.26.5)", and in 6.26.5, 
we see that eta expansion introduces fresh names for subexpressions.  So 
the actual expansion is: 

{noformat}
{ val x0 = xs; val x1 = ys; x => List.map2(x0, x1)(x) } 
{noformat}

for some fresh names x0 and x1. 

The difference matters if a subexpressions has side effects.  So for 
example with eta expansion we see the side effects immediately: 

{noformat}
scala> def f(a: Int)(b: Int) { } 
f: (a: Int)(b: Int)Unit 

scala> def g = { println("hey!"); 4 } 
g: Int 

scala> f(g) _ 
hey! 
res11: Int => Unit = <function1> 
{noformat}

Whereas without the introduction of fresh names, evaluation is deferred: 

{noformat}
scala> f(g)(_) 
res12: Int => Unit = <function1> 
{noformat}

because the behavior in this latter case is governed by 6.23 
("Placeholder Syntax for Anonymous Functions"), not 6.26.5.
