Here is a minimal example that exposes the issue:

{code}
val iter = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).elements; val firstTwoElements = iter.zipWithIndex.takeWhile(_._2 < 2).toList; val x = iter.toList
{code}

Results from the interpreter: 

{code}
iter: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator
firstTwoElements: List[(Int, Int)] = List((1,0), (2,1))
x: List[Int] = List(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
{code}

Note that the 3 is dropped from the iterator ({{x}}) when it shouldn't be. zipWithIndex or takeWhile on their own do not exhibit this behaviour, it appears to be only the combination of the two.

This happens on 2.7.1 final & 2.7.1.r15535-b20080712185233, not sure if its broken in HEAD.
