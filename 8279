I've added a case to the addSynthetics code which is (ironically) sorting the implicit def to the end of the class body.

"Pretty ugly", that useful oxymoron; but for now, limited to the three cases.

As nice issue tracker feature would be: when I create a ticket, let me post my test code which gets put immediately into the repo under tests/pending with the useful file name; then PR acceptance means that test passes and the test is moved to non-pending and the ticket is closed.
