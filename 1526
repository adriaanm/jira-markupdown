you may be right that having problems remain rather than going away may not be a good indicator of whether uninstall and reinstall are working.
but the problems seem to be plugin issues, since I am able to open my project and do things in IntelliJ IDEA.
so my hypothesis is/was that something in the plugin is screwed up, now and reinstalling it could fix that.

in any case, if uninstall and reinstall of the plugin don't work (the plugin isn't uninstalling and reinstalling), regardless of whether that fixes the other issues, that seems like a legitimate issue all by itself.
