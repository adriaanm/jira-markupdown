While Joel and I bootstrapped and tested Scala on Avian, we both encountered that the test suite hangs in test/files/scalacheck/parallel-collections.

This seems to be an issue on Scala's side: Joel discovered that the same also happens on Hotspot when using ThreadPoolTaskSupport:

Nevermind, I figured it out.  There's a lovely bit of code in   scala/collection/parallel/package.scala:

{code}
private[parallel] def getTaskSupport: TaskSupport =
  if (scala.util.Properties.isJavaAtLeast("1.6")) {
    val vendor = scala.util.Properties.javaVmVendor
    if ((vendor contains "Oracle") || (vendor contains "Sun") || (vendor contains "Apple")) new ForkJoinTaskSupport
    else new ThreadPoolTaskSupport
  } else new ThreadPoolTaskSupport
{code}

If I change that to just
{code}
       private[parallel] def getTaskSupport: TaskSupport = new ForkJoinTaskSupport
{code}

the parallel-collections test passes on Avian and HotSpot. However, if I change it to

{code}
       private[parallel] def getTaskSupport: TaskSupport = new ThreadPoolTaskSupport
{code}

it hangs on both Avian and HotSpot.  In other words, the test simply won't complete when using ThreadPoolTaskSupport, regardless of the VM, which means the test can only pass if the VM vendor is Oracle, Sun, or Apple.

Ouch.

It looks like ThreadPoolTaskSupport is broken on all VMs.

Joel's thread dump is attached.

I'll open a separate issue for the insufficient task support detection mechanism.
IBM J9 also hangs with ThreadPoolTaskSupport.

I'm closing this, because I created an explicit new ticket for removals in 2.12: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7566
