Does it matter if the param accessors aren't inherited, when values with the same names are? I guess it matters if the case class fields are private, like in ::, but otherwise... come to think of it the private possibility probably makes it dangerous to think about using members, because
```scala
case class A(private var x: Int) { }
class B(q1: Int) extends A(q1) { def x = 123 }
```
