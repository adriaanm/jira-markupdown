```scala
object Bug {
	class A {};
	class B extends A{};
	class C extends A{};
}

class Bug {
	import Bug._
	
	def show : Unit = {
		var result = "";
		var base = new A();		
		
		//compiles
		val answer = base match {
			case b : B => "b";
			case c : C => "c";
			case _ => "";
		};
		
		result += answer;
		
		//does not compile		
		result += base match {
			case b : B => "b";
			case c : C => "c";
			case _ => "";
		};		 
	}
}
```

There are usually multiple incorrect error warnings on each case line, in the variant that does not compile. The common error warning goes like this: ??scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type; found : X required: Unit??
I think you need parens around the match.

```scala
scala> var s = ""
s: String = ""

scala> s += 2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: Unit
              s += 2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
                                  ^
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(2)
 required: Unit
              s += 2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
                                                  ^

scala> s += (2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" })

scala> s
res8: String = two

scala> s = s + 2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: String
       s = s + 2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
                              ^
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(2)
 required: String
       s = s + 2 match { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
                                              ^

I agree. This is in fact a violation of the [specification](http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf), Sec 6.12.3:
{quote}There's one exception to this rule, which concerns assignment operators. The precedence of an assignment operator is the same as the one of a simple assignment (=). That is, it is lower than the precedence of any other operator.{quote}
And according to 6.12.4 (and naturally), += is an assignment operator: it ends with =, does not start with = and is none of <=, >=, and !=.
Alternate link, or rather, canonical link:

http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#infix-operations

I think it's not a violation because match is not an operator.

There are SO questions about using it as one.  http://stackoverflow.com/q/18148534/1296806
```scala
scala> import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
import collection.mutable.ListBuffer

scala> val b = new ListBuffer[Int]
b: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer()

scala> b += 43 match { case is @ Seq(_*) => is.head }
res0: Int = 43

scala> b toList match { case is @ Seq(_*) => is.head }
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
res1: Int = 43
```
The last result is possible because the thing to the left of match is a postfix expression.  Contrast
```scala
scala> b toList :+ 42
<console>:1: error: ';' expected but integer literal found.
       b toList :+ 42
                   ^
```
I had an idea that they could turn on operator behavior for match when language.postfixOps is off.  That might get confusing, except that this example might be less confusing.  Also confusing, it would have to be the other way around: you'd have to use the command option -language:postfixOps to turn off match precedence; or the parser could produce a multiverse view of your code until it looks at the language options and it collapses to a single reality.  Someone has already suggested that Schroedinger's kitteh runs the nightly builds; why not let her handle every compile run everywhere?

Or,
```scala
scala> s += match 2 then { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
scala> s += match 2 with { case 1 => "one" case 2 => "two" }
```
