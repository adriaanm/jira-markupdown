The fix doesn't work correctly.  According to my reading of the SLS the following is a valid use of pattern matching and guards.
{code}
def signum(x: Int): Int = x match { case 0 => 0
                                    case _ if x < 0 => -1
                                    case _ if x > 0 => 1}
{code}
