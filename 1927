Do you have a use case? Not doing this seems like a feature to me. The intended Java cloning semantics are dubious and error prone and not part of the contract of clone, merely suggestions. In particular you missed out an important chunk of the documentation:

{code}
The general intent is that, for any object x, the expression:

     x.clone() != x

will be true, and that the expression:

     x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()

will be true, but these are not absolute requirements. 
{code}
