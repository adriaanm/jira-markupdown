While Finagle is primarily written in Scala, we support Java users as well. The lack of byte code support for JVM's protected visibility and default (package) visibility is limiting. 

We'd love support for these, perhaps via an annotation. A sketch of what it might look like:
```scala
import scala.annotation.{Modifier, Visibility}

@Visibility(Modifier.Default)
def method1(): Unit = ()

@Visibility(Modifier.Protected)
def method2(): Unit = ()
```
