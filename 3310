I realized I never gave a correct definition, so here it is.
```scala
def takeTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val (before, after) = this span p
  before :+ after.head
}

def dropTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = this dropWhile p tail

def spanTo(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val (before, after) = this span p
  (before :+ after.head, after.tail)
}
```
