This yields 0 instead of 3 with no warning:

```scala
def makeF(i: Int) = () => i

trait Foo { val x: Int; val f = makeF(x) }

val bar = new Foo { val x = 3 }

println( bar.f() )
```

This is ok though:
```scala
trait Foo { val x: Int; val f = () => x }

val bar = new Foo { val x = 3 }

println( bar.f() )
```

Thanks!
We can't warn in general here as you can make this valid with an early initializer:

```scala
scala> val bar = new { val x = 3 } with Foo
bar: Foo = $anon$1@7daf3aa0

scala> bar.f()
res1: Int = 3
```

We might be able to get a check for this into a profile of a linter, especially one that can assume a "closed world", ie it can assume it knows all subclasses of the trait. But that would be a tool outside of the compiler itself.
While that's true that you can make this valid with an early initializer, I think you could still provide a warning or error for the case Arya described.  The following code, for example, gives a compiler error:
```scala
trait Foo { val x: Int; val f = () => x }
 
val bar = new Foo
```
because the trait is abstract and x is not defined.  It seems like in the case Arya described, x is not really defined as far as Foo is concerned, which leads to this subtle bug.

Another way of looking at it might be that x is unset *at the time it's used* in Foo in Arya's example.  Your fix sets x before it will be used in Foo.  Would it be possible to error or warn when variables are used in a trait before they're set?
