```scala
trait Foo {
  self: bar.type =>
  
  final class V(val x: Int) extends AnyVal
  // ./a.scala:4: error: value class may not be a member of another class
  //   final class V(val x: Int) extends AnyVal
  //               ^
  // one error found
}

object bar extends Foo { }
```
This should compile, else we are robbed of all the mechanisms by which one normally can partition a large object into its constituent parts.
Right now the spec says "C is either a toplevel class or is a member of a statically accessible object." In what sense is V not a member of a statically accessible object? If there is a V, is V not a member of bar, the statically accessible object?
