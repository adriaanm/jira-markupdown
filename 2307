I'm going to revert r19670 (https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6063bf3d78 and https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/44e60b3ae6) in master as I cannot reproduce the failure after having replaced localizedOwner by the identity. It seems this workaround is no longer needed.

There's no test in the suite for this, so I compiled the following:
```scala
trait T
trait U

object C { val c = List(1).map(e => (e, new T with U { def x: this.type = ???})) }

object A { val a = C.c }
```

and then accessed `A.a` in the repl -- everything works fine.

I'll first try to find out how this works now exactly. After reverting, I see the same RefinedType being created in scala/bug#6596 whether unpickling or typing directly.
