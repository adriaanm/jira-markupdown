The change that would be required for the spec is in the section on designators. It currently reads:

Specifically, the unqualified type name $$t$$ where $$t$$ is bound in some class, object, or package $$C$$ is taken as a shorthand for C.this.type # t. 

I propose to change this as follows:

Specifically, the unqualified type name $$t$$ where $$t$$ is bound in some class, object, or package $$C$$ is taken as a shorthand for C.this.type # t, except if the type $$t$$ occurs as a part
of a typed pattern (\sref{sec:typed-patterns}). In the latter case,
$$t$$ is taken as a shorthand for just C # t.
