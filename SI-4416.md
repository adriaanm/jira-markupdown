It should be a link that specifically mentions the additional information that will be displayed (i.e., linear superclasses and known subclasses).
(In r24672) [scaladoc] Add explicit link to show linear supertypes and known subclasses. Closes #4416. Modifications to style sheets to reduce number of colors and make the documentation more readable (includes contributions from Ruediger Keller). No review.
