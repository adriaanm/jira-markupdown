motivational examples from test/files/pos/depmet_implicit_oopsla_session_2.scala and neg/depmet_try_implicit.scala

```scala
def runSession[S, D](p: S, dp: D)(implicit s: Session[S]#HasDual[D]) =
  s.run(p, dp)

def runSession[S, D](p: S, dp: D)(implicit s: Session[S]{type Dual=D}) =
  s.run(p, dp)
```

can we relax the ordering restrictions on dependencies so that we can write

```scala
def runSession[S](p: S, dp: s.Dual)(implicit s: Session[S]) =
  s.run(p, dp)
```

this is more than an encoding of the first two snippets as it hides the inference of D, so that you can specify S, but not D (unless you supply the implicit argument explicitly)

(Conceptually, it would be even nicer to be able to write the following, emphasizing the similarity between implicit arguments and type parameters)

```scala
def runSession[S][val s: Session[S]](p: S, dp: s.Dual) =
  s.run(p, dp)
```


It could work by re-arranging argument lists behind the scenes, possibly splitting up the 
implicit argument list, so that the current left-to-right ordering requirement is upheld: types can only depend on arguments on their left.

This is related to the multiple type parameter lists generalisation:

```scala
  def foo[A1, A2][B1, B2](p1 : (A1, B1)) : (A2, B2) = ...
```

could be rewritten to:

```scala
  def foo[A1, A2](p1 : (A1, w.B1))(implicit w: FooBs[A1, A2]) : (A2, w.B2) = ...
```
