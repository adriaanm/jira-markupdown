But then you should rename "{{RichString}}" to "{{RichCharSequence}}" :-). 

If a method is called `RichString.reverse`, the natural thing is to expect it to produce something that is the reverse of the string. You have to either swap combiners with their corresponding base characters before or after the reverse, or normalize the string before reversing ([http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/Normalizer.html java.text.Normalizer], but see http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/07/06/nfc).
```scala
scala> import java.text.Normalizer._
import java.text.Normalizer._

scala> val s = "souf\ufb02e\u0301s" 
s: java.lang.String = soufﬂés

scala> s.reverse                    
res6: scala.runtime.RichString = śeﬂfuos

scala> normalize(s,Form.NFC).reverse
res7: scala.runtime.RichString = s�ﬂfuos

scala> normalize(s,Form.NFKC).reverse
res8: scala.runtime.RichString = s�lffuos
```

Reopening, this should either be fixed, or resolved as wontfix with a good reason.
