Well, I was going for harsh. This is an issue that might break Production environments. The only solution to get rid of the error would be to upgrade the JDK to a non-affected version or to explicitly disable the behavior.

Adding a warning on a development machine is probably not going to do much good.

As for not controlling the runtime, well, you could add a val to `scala.Predef`. It would only be calculated once and probably during the runtime's startup phase.
