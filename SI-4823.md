When using sorting in a Swing Table, it does not map the view row index to the model row index correctly. I'm attaching a patch (based on Ingo's incubator git repo) that fixes this.
(imaier in [r25491|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25491]) Applied patch by Gordon Tyler. Closes #4823.
