this happens in both 2.7 and 2.8:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.7.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).

scala> class C(x: Int) { def foo = x }
defined class C

scala> new C(0)
res0: C = C@34f34071

scala> import res0.x
import res0.x
{code}

the import succeeds, but it should fail because there is no reason x should be visible outside C.
at least, I cannot find anything in the spec to justify x's visibility outside C.

I brought this up on the mailing list in this thread:
http://old.nabble.com/-scala--Visibility-of-class-parameters-td26633887.html
Martin replied, but I think his reply failed to address my point; my post must not have been sufficiently
clear. See clarifying replies from Geoff Reedy and myself. This isn't about "import", and it isn't about
accessibility. It's about visibility, and I'm only using "import" as a way of demonstrating the visibility issue.

Martin hasn't responded further, so I'm asking for review.  (It remains possible that there's something in the spec that addresses this and I just can't find it.) Thanks...

I tried to fix that in r20487 by accepting only non-local members as visible for imports. However, this breaks the interpreter, which seemingly imports local members of $$iw objects. I could not figure out where so I reassign to you, Paul. To reproduce, you need to have a look at the change in Namers in r20487. It contains an alternative implementation of checkSelectors, which causes jvm/interpreter.scala to fail.
