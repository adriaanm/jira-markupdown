Compiling the following two .java files with javac succeeds as expected,

```scala
OuterInterface.java:

public interface OuterInterface {
  public interface InnerInterface {
    public void foo();
  }
}
```

```scala
AbstractImpl.java:

public abstract class AbstractImpl implements OuterInterface {
  public abstract InnerInterface create();
}
```

However, if the following .scala class is added,

```scala
ConcreteImpl.scala:

class ConcreteImpl extends AbstractImpl {
  def create : InnerInterface = null
}
```

and all three are compiled with scalac 2.7.2.RC2, the following unexpected errors are reported against both the Scala **and** the Java,

```scala
miles@frege:test$$ scalac *
ConcreteImpl.scala:2: error: not found: type InnerInterface
  def create : InnerInterface = null
               ^
AbstractImpl.java:2: error: not found: type InnerInterface
  public abstract InnerInterface create();
                  ^
two errors found
```

The only workaround is to add redundant qualifiers to **both** the Java and the Scala sources,

```scala
AbstractImpl2.java:

public abstract class AbstractImpl implements OuterInterface {
  public abstract OuterInterface.InnerInterface create();
}
```

```scala
ConcreteImpl2.scala:

class ConcreteImpl extends AbstractImpl {
  def create : OuterInterface.InnerInterface = null
}
```


That's unfortunately not an easy one (I am not even sure there is a way to fix this). The problem is that in 
```scala
public interface OuterInterface {
  public interface InnerInterface {
    public void foo();
  }
}
```
`InnerInterface` is a static member of `OuterInterface`. So it can't be inherited and the error in `ConcreteImpl.scala` is as expected. As to `AbstractImpl.java`, the Java parser is just a parser, it can't have any context information. The only thing one could possibly consider is import all companion objects of inherited classes and interfaces. I.e `AbstractImpl` could be translated to the following Scala code:
```scala
  abstract class AbstractImpl extends _root_.java.lang.Object with OuterInterface {
    import OuterInterface._
    def create(): InnerInterface
  }
```
But that's both incomplete and possibly incorrect. It's incomplete because 
interfaces inherited by `OuterInterface` are not considered. It's possibly incorrect
because a companion object might not exist. Neither of the two shortcomings can be solved without adding context information, which is beyond our design. So I am afraid it's a wontfix until some completely new design emerges.


There's no particular problem with the qualifier being required in the Scala source, however the error doesn't go away if you compile OuterInterface.java, AbstractImpl.java along with ConcreteImpl2.scala: scalac still reports an error against the Java.

The problem here is that it forces existing correct Java code to be modified before it can be used in a mixed Scala/Java project.
I am getting the same issue with nested static classes. This seems to be a problem for #3347.
oh man. this was hard to isolate.

full compilation, with all sources passed to scalac, succeeds. but then incremental recompilation, with only some sources passed to scalac, fails:
```scala
% cat I.java
interface I { enum E { E1 } ; }
% cat J.java
class J implements I { private E e = E.E1 ; }
% cat S.scala
class S extends J
% /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.RC1/bin/scalac I.java J.java S.scala
% javac I.java J.java
% rm J.class S.class
% /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.RC1/bin/scalac J.java S.scala
J.java:1: error: not found: type E
class J implements I { private E e = E.E1 ; }
                               ^
one error found
```

the problem goes away if E is fully qualified in J:
```scala
% cat I.java
interface I { enum E { E1 } ; }
% cat J.java
class J implements I { private I.E e = I.E.E1 ; }
% cat S.scala
class S extends J
% /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.RC1/bin/scalac I.java J.java S.scala
% javac I.java J.java
% rm J.class S.class
% /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.RC1/bin/scalac J.java S.scala
```
P.S. this does actually happen with my real codebase, with sbt's incremental recompilation. sbt will do the above recompilation if it determines that J.java has been changed.
Related to #4402, also protobuf library generates code exactly like that and you typically have to manually fully qualify types.
Thanks for the code, Seth. I believe the bug is now in the classfile parser. It can be further reduced to the following:

```scala

lampmac3:sandbox luc$$ ls
total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 luc  staff  36 Apr 12 16:00 A.java
-rw-r--r--  1 luc  staff  25 Apr 12 16:13 B.java
-rw-r--r--  1 luc  staff  48 Apr 12 16:12 Test.scala
lampmac3:sandbox luc$$ cat A.java 
interface A {
    interface I { }
}
lampmac3:sandbox luc$$ cat B.java 
class B implements A { }
lampmac3:sandbox luc$$ cat Test.scala 
class Test extends B {
  def foo(): I = null
}

lampmac3:sandbox luc$$ javac *.java
lampmac3:sandbox luc$$ ../target/pack/bin/scalac Test.scala
Test.scala:2: error: not found: type I
  def foo(): I = null
             ^
one error found
```
You can take B out of the equation: it's the same if Test extends A directly.
```

// together ok
% scalac3 Test.scala A.java 
// separate not ok
% scalac3 Test.scala 
Test.scala:2: error: not found: type I
  def foo(): I = null
             ^
one error found
```

Even if I define the java like this (public/public)
```scala
package j;

public interface A {
    public interface I { }
}
```
...why does scala see it as "protected type I = A.I" ?
