when running under -Ydebug, I think this may be relevant:
```scala
[warn] creating stub symbol for value stubbing in package mockito (a classfile may be missing)
```

the assertion 
```scala
java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: value stubbing
	at scala.reflect.internal.Types$ThisType.<init>(Types.scala:1388)
```

fails because we created a StubSymbol hoping that we could keep going a bit longer
except we shouldn't have
