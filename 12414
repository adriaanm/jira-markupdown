So, what is to be done? There are different possibilities, and there are different considerations depending on whether a fix is targeting 2.11.x, 2.12.x, or 2.13.x.

in ascending order of ambitiousness, possibilities include:
- document the existing (gruesome) 2.10/2.11 behavior
- restore the 2.9 behavior (both kinds of ListMap preserve order, but in opposite directions) and document that
- choose a direction and make both kinds of ListMap preserve it, redoing the implementations if necessary

Note that wrapping immutable.List is a really terrible way to implement mutable.ListMap — tons of unnecessary copying.
