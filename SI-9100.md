Xlint doesn't warn about a class param shadowing a super val where the two symbols don't alias the same value in "pass-through" fashion.

Other examples include the form {{class A(x,y) extends B(y,x)}}.

Maybe the warning could recommend using a companion apply to transform the args.

See the query by AbstruselyArcane on SO. I don't know if Arcane is their first name or last.
