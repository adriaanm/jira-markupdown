The following commands will confirm the failing cases.

val indices = (0 to 99999).toArray
val values = Array.fill[Double](100000)(math.random)
scala.util.Sorting.quickSort[Int](indices)(Ordering.by[Int, Double](values(_))) // Works
val values2 = Array.fill[Double](100000)(0.0)
scala.util.Sorting.quickSort[Int](indices)(Ordering.by[Int, Double](values2(_))) // Fails

In Sorting.scala's code if I change lines 144 and 151 to use equiv, instead of ==, then the problem seems to be resolved.
Yup, looks like that does it.  It's a bit of a trap that everything _except_ == works as expected with an Ordering import.  Thanks!
