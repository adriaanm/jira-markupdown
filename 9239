The simple solution to avoid memory leak is to turn _all_ operations in Statistics into no-ops in case statistics is disabled.

However, the whole design is broken because it doesn't work across many Globals. Also, life cycle of that top-level object is not clear to me since you can mutate {{enabled}} flag at any time.
