The Scaladoc kind filter gets left in the wrong state when the kinds are restricted to packages and then the user enters text in the query box. The text enter correctly unapplies the restriction allowing found entities to be shown but the kind filter is left displaying {{display all entities}}. It should say {{display packages only}}.

A suitable application of _MVC_ would remedy this.
