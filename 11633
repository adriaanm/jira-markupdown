The "spaces" heuristic was a paulp innovation to distinguish common interpolations {{s"hello, $name"}} from stuff the compiler often does, which is to insert dollars everywhere.

Now that you can selectively turn off the warning if you are a dollar-inserting app, the improvement would be to remove the heuristic and always warn on embedded, unescaped dollars.
