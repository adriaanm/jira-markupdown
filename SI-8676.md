It would be really nice if there was an easy way to link ScalaDoc pages to source files.
SBT publish publishes archives both scaladoc and source jars. It would be nice to figure out a nice
way to link them.
In sbt, do: 
```scala
scalacOptions in doc ++= Opts.doc.sourceUrl(s"${sourceUrl}€{FILE_PATH}.scala#L1")
```
assuming your sources are available at sourceUrl. The € is for Scaladoc's european-style string interpolation.
