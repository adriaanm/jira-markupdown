We've been thinking how to name a family of functions in reflection that work with objects (aka modules in compiler speak). A few examples: staticModule, reflectModule, ModuleSymbol etc. 

There's a concern that module would be ambiguous because of the associations with packaging, OSGI and stuff. Hence we're looking into the alternative names we could use. 
The REPL response when defining an object probably also needs an update:

```scala
scala> object Foo
defined module Foo
```
