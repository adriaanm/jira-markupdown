The following interpolated string doesn't compile

s"\""

I've checked the issue tracker but couldn't find a ticket for this. The closest I found is https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6631

Workaround is to use a multiline string, i.e., s"""\"""" works fine.
Looks like a duplicate of https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6476
