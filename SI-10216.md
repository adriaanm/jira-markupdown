This is my very first issue submission to Scala, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes I might have made in filling out the different fields.

Calling toHexString method on numeric types other than Int will produce unexpected output. I believe that toHexString is not implemented in Byte and Short and an implicit conversion to Int is happening.

scala> -1.toByte.toHexString
res2: String = ffffffff
// should be "ff"

scala> -1.toShort.toHexString
res3: String = ffffffff
// should be "ffff"

scala> -1.toHexString
res4: String = ffffffff
// is correct

scala> -1.toLong.toHexString
res5: String = ffffffffffffffff
// is correct
It's also not implemented on Int. Using tab completion after the print comment:
```scala
scala> 42.toHexString //print
   scala.Predef.intWrapper(42).toHexString // : String

scala> -1.toByte.toHexString //print
   scala.Predef.intWrapper(-1.toByte.toInt).toHexString // : String

```
There is no `java.lang.Byte.toHexString` but formatting does what you want:
```scala
scala> f"${-1.toByte}%x"
res0: String = ff
```
I'm not sure there is a welcome tag for the label field like they have on github.
Hi, I'd like to take up this task. I'm bit of a beginner (cloned the repo and built the project last week) and found this task relatively easy. :) So, basically I've to implement this function in *RichByte.scala* in *scala/src/library/scala/runtime*, right?
