(extempore in [r25215|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25215]) Stable hashCodes for case objects.
Somehow case objects fell through the cracks and have had
default hashCode implementations, leading to new hashCodes on
each jvm run.  Now we use the productPrefix, and inline it
right into the bytecode.
