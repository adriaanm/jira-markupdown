The translation of the placeholder syntax for anonymous functions is purely syntactic, and can't be influenced by the types. I don't believe that your proposal could be specified in simple manner.

About all we could do would be to tweak the error message to offer a hint based on the context: in your example we could detect that we are typechecking the argument to an application which itself is the argument of a of a higher-order function and it looks like the types won't line up. But you might well have an implicit from `Double => (Any => T)` that means that the types *could* line up; it's hard to give accurate messages about applications after type errors in the arguments.
