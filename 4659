Oh yes. With that, I could find the real cause (applies to a .NET version). When compiling scala.math.ScalaNumber (a .java file) with ikvmc, 

{code}
public abstract class ScalaNumber extends java.lang.Number {
  protected abstract boolean isWhole();
  public abstract Object underlying();
}
{code}

the "protected" for isWhole() resulted in famorassem in the .NET counterpart, which for now was being kept in a different assembly from scala-lib (shouldn't). 

Four peverify errors less.
