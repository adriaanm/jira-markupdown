Please allow selectively disabling the warning about a possibly missing interpolator.  Some templating applications will naturally trigger false positives and working around that is annoying.  Explaining why there is no easy workaround is also annoying.

Is there any warning that should be switch on -Xlint instead of a granular option that is aggregated by -Xlint?
