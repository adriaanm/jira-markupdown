The code gives an assertion failure with 2.6.0-final, as does the following minor simplification

{code}
class Test {
    abstract class C[A] {}
    val c = new C[Int] {
        def f[A](x: A) {}
    }
}
{code}

May it (or something similar) please be added to the test suite.


Along the same lines, SI-365 says
"This test has also been moved to pending until the bug is fixed."
Is that test active now?
