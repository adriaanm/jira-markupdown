Since the author's reply is not too prominent in the bug report, here is why I said they might be related:
```scala
Thanks for the report. ProGuard trips on the following Signature
attribute:

<t::Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/util/parsing/ast/AbstractSyntax;
Lscala/util/parsing/ast/Mappable;
Lscala/ScalaObject.NameElement;>(Tt;)Ljava/lang/Object;
Lscala/util/parsing/ast/AbstractSyntax;
Lscala/util/parsing/ast/Mappable;Lscala/ScalaObject.Mappable<Tt;>;

I would expect colons inbetween the initial ClassBound and InterfaceBounds
of type 't'. Can you check if the signature is correct?
```
