The TypeTree produced by the macro expansion has a null original. Therefore when the result of its typedType, a TypeTree, calls setOriginal passing that tree as an argument, the following code NPEs:

{code}
def setOriginal(tree: Tree): this.type = {
  def followOriginal(t: Tree): Tree = t match {
    case tt: TypeTree => followOriginal(tt.original)
    case t => t
  }

  orig = followOriginal(tree); setPos(tree.pos)
  this
}
{code}
