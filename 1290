maybe we should just deprecate this `= _` thing. the only time it means something you can really count on is for AnyRef types, in which case you might as well write `= null`, rather than sneak a null into your program without actually writing "null" into the source. and if someone wants the Any/AnyVal behavior they can always write `= null.asInstanceOf[T]`, raising explicit two red flags right there in the source — again, less sneaking.
