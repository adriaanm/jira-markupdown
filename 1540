Hi, recently run into false "dead code" warnings using the Scale IDE for Eclipse -- seemingly the problem is still there. What I don't understand is: in my example no type parameter is involved (but maybe there is some hidden type parameter?)

{code}
package dummy

object Error {
    def soSorry(msg: String = "sorry"): Nothing =
        throw new Exception("we have a problem: "+msg)
}

class Dummy {

    def dummy1: Int = synchronized {
        val i = 10 + 2
        return i
    }
    
    def dummy2: String = Error.soSorry("we're dummies")
}
{code}
compiling with 2.8.0 {{scalac -Ywarn-dead-code dummy/Dummy.scala }} produces two dead code warnings
