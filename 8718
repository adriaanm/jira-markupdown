Jason, no, I don't use scala.swing.SwingWorker, but I have own internal wrapper around javax.swing.SwingWorker:
{code}
import javax.swing.SwingWorker
import scala.swing._
...

protected class SwiWorker[T](parent : Component, msg : String, job : => Answer[T], showPost : Boolean, 
                  postMsg : String, postJob : Answer[T] => Unit) extends SwingWorker[Answer[T],AnyRef] {
   ...
}
{code}
Probably this import list is dangerous at some point: scala.swing package contains SwingWorker also.
