Sometimes between r23407 and r23427 we lost script stack traces:
{code}
object Test {
  throw new Exception
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  }
}  
{code}
{code}
% /scala/inst/scala-2.9.0.r23427-b20101101134858/bin/scala Test
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
%  
{code}
It's a pretty sure bet it's one of my commits but I can't look into it this second, so ticket.
(In r23472) Restored the stack traces I'd accidentally smothered in r23426, and
cleaned up ObjectRunner/ScriptRunner a bit.  Closes SI-3978, no review.
I don't know what's going on now, but the test case in SI-4033 prints no stack trace with trunk as of r23579.
{code}
scala29 -nocompdaemon a.scala 
ok:class Main$$$$anon$$1$$ok$$
java.lang.StackOverflowError
{code}
(In r23590) In the absence of known reasons why some exceptions are intercepted
or have their stack trace printed and others fly unchallenged, changed
script and object runners to handle everything consistently when an
exception is thrown.  Closes SI-3978 again, no review.
