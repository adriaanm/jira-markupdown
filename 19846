Someone [asked for it|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32789259/alternative-to-control-d-for-paste-mode-in-scala-repl/].

{code}
scala> :pa < EOF
42
EOF
{code}

and perhaps with margin stripping

{code}
scala> :pa <| EOF
  |42
EOF
{code}

where {{<-}} just strips tabs.

Maybe {{-Dscala.repl.eof=EOF}}.
