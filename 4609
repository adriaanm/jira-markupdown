(In r22702) Disallowed super.XX calls to Any methods which are presently either
crashing the compiler (isInstanceOf) or leading to runtime failure
(== and !=) in addition to one which was being rewritten to a this call
but makes more sense disallowed like the others (##).

Closes scala/bug#3736, review by odersky.
