Information can be found on using the FindBugs ant task here:
http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/anttask.html

I've installed FindBugs in linuxsoft/apps/findbugs/
Replying to [ticket:571 washburn]:


The Eclipse folks already figured out how to integrate FindBugs into their build, 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=247073
although in the end it was not put in practice due to the usual argument that "too many false positives, which break the build unless explicitly configured as exceptions" 

(but making the source more explicit to prevent false positives in the first place looks like a better idea). 

A more recent take on the same topic (only that addressing the Athena Build Infrastructure, which looks like Ant to me anyway) appears in:
