Often it is necessary to define an implicit variable that is merely a reference to an existing non-implicit variable:

{code:scala}
val now = DateTime.now
implicit val rightNow = now
{code}

Unfortunately, -Ywarn-unused-import reports implicits that are used. This discourages people from using this otherwise helpful switch. It would be terrific if the switch could figure out that an implicit value is actually used, and not generate a warning for that variable.
looks closely related to SI-9383
Is there an example or minimization?

Apparently, you don't mean:
{code}
import java.time.LocalDateTime

import scala.concurrent._, ExecutionContext.Implicits

object Test extends App {
  val now = LocalDateTime.now
  implicit val t = now

  Console println implicitly[LocalDateTime]

  implicit val global = Implicits.global
  val f = Future(42)
  Console println f
}


{code}
Hmm, I modified your test and got different results than my much larger program. There are problems with -Ywarn-unused-imports and -Ywarn-unused, but not as I originally reported. I made a github project [https://github.com/mslinn/warnUnusedFlags] with this code example.

{code:scala}
import java.time.LocalDateTime

import scala.concurrent._, ExecutionContext.Implicits
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration

object Test extends App {
  val now = LocalDateTime.now
  implicit val t = now

  // warn-unused-imports should generate a warning when this is commented out but it does not:
  // Console println implicitly[LocalDateTime]

  // warn-unused should generate a warning when this is present but it does not:
  val shouldComplain = now

  implicit val global = Implicits.global
  val f = Future(42)
  Console println Await.result(f, Duration.Inf)
}
{code}

The examples given are not valid. Public members could be used anywhere. `LocalDateTime` is a used import.

I notice one anomaly, in that there can be no warning for local definitions that are eliminated:
{code}
$ scala -Xprint:parser,typer -Ywarn-unused
