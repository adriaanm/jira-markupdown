I think it would be more in keeping with the style and intention of the Scala swing library to have property-style access for the BorderPanel, rather than the existing add() method. 

Here is a use case which I hope illustrates the ease with which it allows complex nested layouts:
```scala
    val p = new BorderPanel {
      north = new BorderPanel {
        center = new TextField("Search")
        east = new Button("Go")
      }
      center = new TextArea
      south = new Label("Status Bar")
    }
```

I hope I am not outstaying my welcome in providing source code for the mixin I have used to achieve this so far:
```scala
trait RichBorderPanel extends BorderPanel {
  import scala.collection.mutable.Map
  
  /** Cached map of Scala components enables getter access for border properties. */
  private val scalaComponents: Map[Position.Value, Option[Component]] = Map(
    Center -> None, 
    North -> None, 
    South -> None,
    West -> None,
    East -> None)
  
  /** Overridden for backwards compatibility */
  protected override def add(c: Component, l: Constraints) { setComponent(Some(c), l) }
  
  protected def setComponent(c: Option[Component], pos: Constraints): Unit = {
    val existingAwtComp = layoutManager.getLayoutComponent(pos.toString)
    if (existingAwtComp != null)
        peer.remove(existingAwtComp)
    peer.add(c map(_.peer) getOrElse null, pos.toString)
    scalaComponents(pos) = c
  }
  
  protected def getComponent(pos: Constraints): Option[Component] = {
    val scalaComp = scalaComponents(pos)
    val awtComp = layoutManager.getLayoutComponent(pos.toString)
    val matching = (scalaComp map (_.peer) getOrElse null) == awtComp
    if (!matching)
      throw new IllegalStateException(pos + " component was modified externally")

    scalaComp
  } 
  
  def east = getComponent(East)
  def east_=(c: Option[Component]) = setComponent(c, East)
  def east_=(c: Component) = setComponent(Some(c), East)
  // And so forth for north, west, etc
  ...
}
```
This design allows for getting, setting, Option values, backwards compatibility, and should cleanly fail in the event of the component map becoming misaligned with the backing BorderLayout.
