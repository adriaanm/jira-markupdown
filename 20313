A simple ping-pong throughput test of Akka yields 10-40% lower throughput with Scala 2.12 than 2.11. Reproducer project: https://github.com/johanandren/akka-ping-pong run with forked `run` from inside of sbt and `++2.12.0` followed by `run` to run bench on 2.12

Used yourkit and looked at allocation rates/gc which is a tiny bit worse but not enough to explain it (I think), nothing obvious from CPU trace profiling either (see attached yourkit snapshots, sorry about bz2 but couldn't get them small enought to attach with zip).
