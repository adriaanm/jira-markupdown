!RefinedBuildManager has the information immediately available, it just currently discards it and then resets the reporter so it isn't available by manager.compiler.reporter.hasErrors.  The changes required to return a Boolean indicating success are trivial.

A custom Reporter would require subclassing Reporter.  This would require the test framework to be compiled against and run using the same version of Scala being tested, which is an unwarranted complexity.
