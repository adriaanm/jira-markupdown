When upgrading to 2.9.2. to 2.10.1, ran into this.
Minimal test case:
{code}
def foo: String = try return "Hello" finally 10 match {case x => ()}
{code}
throws
{noformat}
java.lang.VerifyError: (class: , method: foo signature: ()Ljava/lang/String;) Inconsistent stack height 0 != 1
{noformat}

when accessed.

Seems to be the combination of return in the try and the pattern match in the finally that does it.

Looks like James Iry blogged about something related, recently:
