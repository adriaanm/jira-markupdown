The following code ought to compile.

```scala
def f(a: int, b: Int) = 0
f(a = 4, 5)
```
looks like the issue requires a bit more attention
it still doesn't compile in case of several overloads and error message is really misleading:
```scala
class c {def f(a:Int, b:Int) = 1; def f() = 1}
new c().f(a=1,2)
```

fails with
```scala
<console>:18: error: overloaded method value f with alternatives:
  ()Int <and>
  (a: Int,b: Int)Int
 cannot be applied to (a: Int, Int)
              new c().f(a=1,2)
```

tested with 2.8.0, 2.9.1 and scala-2.10.0.r25912-b20111031024940
