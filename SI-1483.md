Using 2.7.2.RC6.

When manually copying scala sources to the directory of a package and hitting "Refresh", the new files show up twice (as Java and Scala source files) in the package explorer.

The same happens when importing them with the "Import..." feature.
Yes, this is a known problem. It isn't necessary to restart Eclipse ... just closing and reopening the project from the package explorer right context menu should eliminate the duplicates.
