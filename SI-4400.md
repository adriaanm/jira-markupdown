=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===

Given this trait, with a private type member:

```scala
 scala> trait X { private[this] type A = Int; def a: A = 1 }
 defined trait X
```

The access restrictions correctly prevent me from accessing the type
member from outside of `x`.

```scala
 scala> type xA = x.A
 <console>:10: error: type A is not a member of java.lang.Object with X
        type xA = x.A
                  ^
 scala> val x = new X {}
 x: java.lang.Object with X = $$anon$$1@58bf7b3e

 scala> x.a
 res6: Int = 1
```

But I can see the type in the eta-expanded signature here:

```scala
 scala> x.a _
 res7: () => x.A = <function0>
```

Not sure if this is a problem, it just strikes me as a bit odd to
allow private type members to appear in public signatures, by contrast
with the way private template definitions are handled.

```scala
 scala> trait X { private[this] trait A; def a: A = null }
 <console>:8: error: private trait A escapes its defining scope as
part of type X.this.A
        trait X { private[this] trait A; def a: A = null }
```

Similar problems exists with other access modifiers.
