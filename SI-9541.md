When I try to print scala documentation, the format on the print page does come good. For example I open http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.StringOps and click Ctrl+P it shows me incorrect print preview.
Basically, I mean the alignment of the content what we see on web page is not retained when we print the web page. Image 1 shows print of java.lang.Object which is clean and it is actually represents the way it is shown on web page. Image 2 is the scala doc 2.12.0-M5. Image 3 represents it's print where we can see the alignment of the content is not alike of that on the web page. The package names on right side of web page Image 3 are actually not required when we print the document, it is creating a 30 page document from simple 3 page web page as shown in Image 4. This is the case for all the browsers.

[~Narsi] - thanks for reporting this. The problem can be remedied by adding a proper css for printing Ã  la:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href={toRoot + "/resources/print.css"}>
```

To headers in:
```html
src/scaladoc/tools/nsc/doc/html/page/Entity.scala
```

I'm sure @SethTisue agrees that we'd love a contribution on this :)
