I'm using Scala-2.10.0-M7 with the following sbt flags
```scala
scalacOptions ++= Seq("-deprecation", "-unchecked", "-feature", "-language:implicitConversions,reflectiveCalls,postfixOps,higherKinds,existentials")
```

Everything compiles fine but during my classes instantiation I get:
```scala
[error] Could not create an instance of XXXX
[error]   caused by scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing
[error]   scala.Predef$.$qmark$qmark$qmark(Predef.scala:246)
[error]   scala.language$.implicitConversions$lzycompute(language.scala:68)
[error]   scala.language$.implicitConversions(language.scala:68)
```

The XXXX class mentioned above is a class I'm trying to instantiate with the "newInstance" method. I'm creating this as a bug because my code otherwise compiles fine and I was not expecting a runtime error here.
