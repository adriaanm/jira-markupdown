It would help enormously if you could extract out a small test case from the project that reproduces this. What you're looking for is a concrete type declaration, ie.,

{code}
  type Foo = ... // RHS is not empty
{code}

The bug will trip when you first open the file, or expand it's outline in the Package explorer.
