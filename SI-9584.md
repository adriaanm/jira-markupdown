I'm not sure whether it's a bug, it happens these days in our test environment,
when we call  list.map method, sometimes it throws

{code}
java.util.NoSuchElementException: head of empty list
	at scala.collection.immutable.Nil$.head(List.scala:420) ~[scala-library-2.11.6.jar:na]
	at scala.collection.immutable.Nil$.head(List.scala:417) ~[scala-library-2.11.6.jar:na]
	at scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:277) ~[scala-library-2.11.6.jar:na]
{code}

it doesn't happen all the time ,is it possible the jdk issue?

Reviewing the relevant code, I conclude that there must be two instance of {{Nil$}} (the "module class" of the module {{Nil}}) around.

Perhaps something is subverting the private access of the constructor of this class via reflection? I can reproduce that stack trace with:

{code}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val OrigNil = Nil

    val constructor = Nil.getClass.getDeclaredConstructors.head
    constructor.setAccessible(true)
    val l1 = "" :: Nil
    val OtherNil = constructor.newInstance().asInstanceOf[List[Nothing]]
    val l2 = "" :: OtherNil
    try {
      l1.map(x => x) // "head of empty list" @ map(List.scala:277)
    } catch {
      case x: Throwable => x.printStackTrace()
    }
    val NewNil = Nil

    println(Nil eq NewNil)  // true
    println(Nil eq OrigNil) // false
  }
}
{code}

Under normal circumstances, the constructor of {{Nil$}} is called in the static initializer of that class. It assigns the result to the field {{Nil$.MODULE$}}. The JVM guarantees that static initialization is protected by a lock on the class, so there should be no chance of a race condition creating multiple instances of {{Nil}}.

Here's the relevant parts of the bytecode:

{code}
  public static final scala.collection.immutable.Nil$ MODULE$;
    descriptor: Lscala/collection/immutable/Nil$;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC, ACC_FINAL

  public static {};
    descriptor: ()V
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=0, args_size=0
         0: new           #2                  // class scala/collection/immutable/Nil$
         3: invokespecial #17                 // Method "<init>":()V
         6: return

...
  private scala.collection.immutable.Nil$();
    descriptor: ()V
    flags: ACC_PRIVATE
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=1, args_size=1
         0: aload_0
         1: invokespecial #89                 // Method scala/collection/immutable/List."<init>":()V
         4: aload_0
         5: putstatic     #83                 // Field MODULE$:Lscala/collection/immutable/Nil$;
         8: return
      LocalVariableTable:
        Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
            0       9     0  this   Lscala/collection/immutable/Nil$;
      LineNumberTable:
        line 417: 0
{code}

Does your test environment include anything that might use reflection (perhaps mocking, serialization) ?

You could set a breakpoint in the constructor of {{Nil$}} to try to track this down further.

I'm going to mark this ticket as "incomplete" for now as there isn't enough info here for us to reproduce, but please reopen or comment if you have further questions or insights.
Here's the implementation of {{List.map}} I reviewed: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.6/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.scala#L275-L281
