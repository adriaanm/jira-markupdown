On the theory java 7 will come out someday, we should have a strategy in mind for dealing with it.  As things stand it looks to me like we would have to fork java6 and java7 versions.  This is due to the generification of certain classes such as javax.swing.Jlist:

[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JList.html java 6 JList]

[http://download.java.net/jdk7/docs/api/javax/swing/JList.html java 7 JList<E>]

Since SI-2970 was closed wontfix I take it improving support for raw types is not on the agenda.  I spent some time tweaking trunk toward compiling but any change which leads toward success on java 7 invariably leads toward failure on java 6.  This may be a bullet we just have to take, but I'm opening this so everyone knows the gun has been fired.

The outcome of compiling trunk scala.swing against java7:

I have an irresolvable issue which I can't allocate to the build process.  I'd really like to be able to use java7 for the speed and better tools, but I can't finish porting swing because of this.

scala> new javax.swing.DefaultComboBoxModel { }
<console>:6: error: illegal inheritance;
 anonymous class $$anon inherits different type instances of trait ListModel:
javax.swing.ListModel[E] and javax.swing.ListModel[E]
       new javax.swing.DefaultComboBoxModel { }
           ^
{code}
This interesting situation arises because javax.swing.ComboBoxModel extends javax.swing.ListModel.  But the interface is javax.swing.ListModel<E>, so it swallows up the type parameter in an unrecoverable way.  Meanwhile javax.swing.AbstractListModel<E> extends javax.swing.ListModel<E>.  In scala.swing this hits in ComboBox:
{code}
// the code at present
new AbstractListModel with ComboBoxModel
// what it needs to look like
new AbstractListModel[something] with ComboBoxModel
// what happens, regardless of "something"
//
// [scalacfork]  anonymous class $$anon inherits different type instances of trait ListModel:
// [scalacfork] javax.swing.ListModel and javax.swing.ListModel[AnyRef]
// [scalacfork]     new AbstractListModel[AnyRef] with ComboBoxModel {
// [scalacfork]         ^
//
// [scalacfork]  anonymous class $$anon inherits different type instances of trait ListModel:
// [scalacfork] javax.swing.ListModel and javax.swing.ListModel[Nothing]
// [scalacfork]     new AbstractListModel with ComboBoxModel {
// [scalacfork]         ^
{code}
Reclassifying as defect and kicking back to scala reviewer.  It's worth the trouble to figure something out now that lets us use java7, even if we don't anticipate supporting it for a long while yet.
> Paul, is that "inherits different type instances" the only thing that prevents you from building swing on Java 7?

I can't yet say more errors don't arise at some later stage, but as far as I know yes, that one error is the entire obstacle.

I'm with you on avoiding a dribble of gross hacks.  I will verify that this is the one and only issue and report back.

Here is the patch.

  https://github.com/scala/scala/tree/openjdk

It's all legit except for the issue already outlined in this ticket.  For that one I brought out good old Mr. Null and his bag of nullities.
{code}
+  // XXX Returning null since there's not yet a workaround for SI-3634.
+  def newConstantModel[A](items: Seq[A]): ComboBoxModel = { null
{code}

Replying to [comment:16 extempore]:
> Here is the patch.

...and to disentangle these not quite intersecting thoughts, ijuma is presumably talking about submitting a java patch.  I'm not your man for that.  My world starts where their world ends.

ok, so as I understand it, you've worked around the issue by removing some code from our swing library -- I'll put a scalac-level workaround on my list of things to do before the year ends, so that we can compile the library in all its unchanged glory against openjdk7 (and by we I mean you)
