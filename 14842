I suggest the following addition to Predef:
```scala
type =>?[A, B] = PartialFunction[A, B]
```

Partial functions could thus be declared like:
```scala
val f: Int =>? Int = { case i: Int => i * 2 }
```

I think that this elegantly captures the nature of a partial function in contrast to a regular function that uses the => operator.
