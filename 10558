You need to do a `test:compile`. Then you will get errors such as:

```

And it seems that the reason is that imports are not being considered in QuickStart for example (there's even a warning saying that the import is not used):
```scala
Unit specifications extend the `org.specs2.mutable.Specification` trait and are using the `should/in` format: ${snippet{

import org.specs2.mutable._

class HelloWorldSpec extends Specification {

  "The 'Hello world' string" should {
    "contain 11 characters" in {
      "Hello world" must have size(11)
    }
    "start with 'Hello'" in {
      "Hello world" must startWith("Hello")
    }
    "end with 'world'" in {
      "Hello world" must endWith("world")
    }
  }
}
}}
```
