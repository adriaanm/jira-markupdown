Scala Migrations [1] has the following snippet in Migration.scala [2]
```scala
  private def indexNameFor(tableName: String,
                           columnNames: Array[String],
                           options: IndexOption*): (String, List[IndexOption]) = {
  ...
  }

  final def addIndex(tableName: String,
                     columnNames: Array[String],
                     options: IndexOption*) {
    if (columnNames.isEmpty) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Adding an index requires at " +
        "least one column name.")
    }

    var (name, opts) = indexNameFor(tableName, columnNames, options: _*)

    var unique = false
    for (opt @ Unique <- opts) {
      opts = opts filter { _ ne opt }
      unique = true
    }
```

2.11.0 gives the following warning:
```scala
[warn] /var/lib/jenkins/tomcat7/jenkins/jobs/scala-migrations-gerrit/workspace/src/main/scala/com/imageworks/migration/Migration.scala:357: local var name in method addIndex is never set - it could be a val
[warn]     var (name, opts) = indexNameFor(tableName, columnNames, options: _*)
[warn]          ^
```

Since `opts` is modified, I cannot make the `var` a `val` without other changes, such as copying `opts` to `os` and then modifying that.

I don't know if this counts as a real bug, since it is correct, but the fix is more than what the warning suggests.  Maybe the warning text just needs to be tweaked.
