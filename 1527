An update: if you delete most of the large string expression starting on line 147,
the problem goes away.  It may be that the Scala Compiler can't handle this large expression.
Yes!  That's it!

object Test {
   var test = "abcdefghijk" +
        "0123456789" +
        "0123456789" +
        "0123456789" +
        ... // 200 times
      ;
}

gets the same behavior.  So if you have a large stack you won't have the problem.
That explains the intermittentness.

I'm not sure if this **really** counts as a bug.  I guess it means I
will have to change the scanner generator to not generate these large strings.
