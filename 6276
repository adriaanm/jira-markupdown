This is fixed in trunk. In investigating [Jenkins reporting success when Scala fails](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8254362/jenkins-reporting-success-when-scala-fails), this is a different aspect of the same problem.

The fix is simple, in $SCALA_HOME/bin/scala, line 25, change

{code:title=scala}
function onExit() {
  if [[ "$saved_stty" != "" ]]; then
    restoreSttySettings
    exit $scala_exit_status
  fi
}
```scala

move the exit outside the test for $saved_stty.

{code:title=scala}
function onExit() {
  if [[ "$saved_stty" != "" ]]; then
    restoreSttySettings
  fi
  exit $scala_exit_status
}
```

This has already been done in trunk, and this works with the latest build.
