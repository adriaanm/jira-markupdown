The API doc for scala.Dynamic reads:
"[...] calls x.meth(args) [... are ...] rewritten to x.applyDynamic("meth", args)."

While they are actually rewritten to x.applyDynamic("meth")(args).

(I'm setting Priority to Critical because it's as bad as a doc bug can be -- took me quite a while to figure out, and I'm not sure I would have been able to guess without access to snippets out there or the compiler's source; apologies if I'm breaking policy or custom).
Also:

"Instances x of this trait [...] If a call is not natively supported by x, it is rewritten [...]"

What really matters is not whether the INSTANCE supports the call or not, but whether the visible (compile-time) type of x supports it.
I've included my suggestion for a fix in the patch I just posted for #4536.
