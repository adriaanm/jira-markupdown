What is your impression of the arrangement here? Do you often find people lining up to perform tests which only you have expressed an interest in and which you won't perform yourself? I can guarantee you the default implementation will not be changed if it imposes a 10+% slowdown on the compiler (regardless of whether it could be "worked around") and I'm not too sure why I should have to convince you of this.
