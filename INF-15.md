Scalap was dropped when 2.7.2 was released ( http://www.nabble.com/Scalap-is-gone--td19135421.html) , is still absent in 2.7.3, and will (We hope!) re-appear in a near-future release ( https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/changeset/16922 )

However, the website still advertised scalap as part of the distribution:
 1. http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads
 1. http://www.scala-lang.org/node/36 which also includes a dead link to http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/tools/scalap.html

These web pages should either be properly versioned (with an accruate page for each Scala release) or updated to reflect the current generally available final version (2.7.3 at time of writing.)

If 2.8.0 is due (with scalap) so soon that switching the page back and forth would be a pain, the page should at least be updated to note "scalap is not available in 2.7.2 - 2.7.3, but is planned for 2.8.0")

Little fixes like this help new users stay confident in the website and docs.

Thanks!
