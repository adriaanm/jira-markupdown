Hey Iulian,

That's a great idea to formalize the contract! What you say is the type returned by targeted type-check (if any) is the same as the type obtained by full type-check, right?
That would be great to have. However may it be that `tree.tpe.isOverloadedType` is not only true for method calls?
Seems analyzing tree structure is safer than type-checking enclosing tree unconditionally?
