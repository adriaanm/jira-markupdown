If I type these two lines into the Scala interpreter they work fine:

{code}
implicit def iterableWithSum(it: Iterable[Int]) = new { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
println((1 to 10).sum)
{code}

but with the same two lines in a script, I get:


{code}
(fragment of foo.scala):2: error: value sum is not a member of Range.Inclusive
println((1 to 10).sum)
{code}



I have not looked into it, but there appear to be two issues.  First is that the script runner puts code directly into a main() method, but a better way would be to put it inside an object.  That is, the currently generated code for a script is like this:
{code}
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    implicit def iterableWithSum(it: Iterable[Int]) = new { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
    println((1 to 10).sum)
  }
}
{code}
It would be better to put the script code inside an object, like this:
{code}
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    new AnyRef {
      implicit def iterableWithSum(it: Iterable[Int]) = new { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
      println((1 to 10).sum)
    }
  }
}
{code}
Something like that.  This simple change would solve other limitations with scripts, e.g. allowing overloaded methods and mutually recursive functions.  It should just be a matter of modifying ScriptRunner's preambleCode method and the "end" variable within wrappedScript.

The second issue, though, is that implicits might not be working when they are defined in the same block-local scope as the use of the method.  From my understanding of the spec, this should be allowed, but I admit I haven't thought about it much.
FYI, the workaround that Martin in suggested in response to another report of mine (SI-733) also works in this case;
the code compiles if I change it to read:
{code}
class RichIterableInt(it:Iterable[Int]) { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
implicit def iterableWithSum(it: Iterable[Int]) = new RichIterableInt(it)
println((1 to 10).sum)
{code}
perhaps the changes you suggest to how scripts works are still a good idea, though.
