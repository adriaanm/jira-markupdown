The {{flatMapN}} methods look more like folds to me. I think the same functionality can be obtained using for comprehensions:
{code}
  for (a <- optionA; b <- optionB; c <- optionC) yield f(a, b, c)
{code}

I wouldn't add {{ifNone}} and {{iif}}, they seem to small to warrant the loss of performance and clarity.
