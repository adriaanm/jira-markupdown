The `flatMapN` methods look more like folds to me. I think the same functionality can be obtained using for comprehensions:
```scala
  for (a <- optionA; b <- optionB; c <- optionC) yield f(a, b, c)
```

I wouldn't add `ifNone` and `iif`, they seem to small to warrant the loss of performance and clarity.
