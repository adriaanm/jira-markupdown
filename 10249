I have the same error on Mac OS X. I can't compile scaladoc right now, however I took the .dot output from the -diagrams-debug option and used dot manually to produce an output file and that works. Using this step I get the same warning as documented above about "Arial".
dot also returns "0" giving a hint that it did not produce an error. Maybe scaladoc thinks that an error occured because dot is writing to stdout /stderr which is not expected?
