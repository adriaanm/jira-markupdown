I can no longer profile scalac with yourkit (and it really needs some profiling!) because they obfuscate their jars, and the obfuscation algorithm generates packages and classes with the same name, as seen here:
```scala
com/yourkit/d.class
com/yourkit/d/a$$1.class_
com/yourkit/d/a.class_
com/yourkit/d/b.class_
com/yourkit/d/c$$a.class_
com/yourkit/d/c$$b.class_
com/yourkit/d/c.class_
```
scala refuses to deal with this:
```scala
error: package yourkit contains object and package with same name: d
one of them needs to be removed from classpath
```
I haven't looked enormously hard for a workaround yet, so maybe there is one; but this seems likely to be an ongoing issue.  If such naming is legal on the JVM (and given that this is what yourkit ships, it must be) then it needs to be usable from scala or the promise of java compatibility takes another left to the jaw.
Can you explain under what circumstances this arises. It seems your application is looking for some class or package in com/yourkit, but since it's obfuscated, why do that?

Hi everyone, I'm quite a newbie regarding scala but I've encountered the same problem with an obfuscated jar.

I use a library from an external company which is obfuscated (Qoppa JPDFProcess) and even if I don't directly access any of the obfuscated classes scalac still complains about a package and an object with the same name.

```scala
(fragment of pdf_preflight.scala):1: error: package pdfViewer contains object and package with same name: a
one of them needs to be removed from classpath
val p = new com.qoppa.pdfProcess.PDFDocument.PDFDocument()
```

So is there anything I can do? The jar works perfectly with javac. If I can help in any way I would like to, but I have no experience in compilers and such things.

And I hope its ok to hijack this bug.
I have the same problem with scala 2.8.0.Beta1 and obfuscated library:
```scala
... error: package trree contains object and package with same name: b
 one of them needs to be removed from classpath
       val sail = new com.ontotext.trree.OwlimSchemaRepository()
                                   ^
```
I am not importing the conflicting class nor package. This error breaks java interoperability. This worked with scala 2.7.7.

Why are the scala package naming/importing rules enforced on valid binary java imports, instead of being scoped only on compiled scala sources?
If the solution would require dramatic changes in the Scala compiler which are
difficult to maintain then my vote is **to keep the Scala compiler clean**.
In this case the obfuscator  will find a solution for Scala. We do not need to 
change every java obfuscator in the world, we just need to use the one which is
able to work with Scala.
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) also adopts this convention where class names and package names collide (except the colliding packages do not have any class files --- they only have resource files.) So I'd like to point out that this isn't just about obfuscators.

In my situation, the fix would be easier. We just want scala compiler to only consider real packages that contain some classes.
(extempore in [r25145](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25145)) Added a -Y option to resolve namespace collisions between package and
object. It's a blunt instrument: if people have lots of these conflicts
they need to resolve in individually nuanced fashion, they'll probably
remain out of luck. But now people can use YourKit probes without a
custom hacked compiler. Let's say this closes #2089. Review by odersky.
