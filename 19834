To merge this:

We need to adapt:

https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-ide/blob/4.2.0-rc3/org.scala-ide.sdt.core/src/org/scalaide/core/internal/jdt/model/ScalaStructureBuilder.scala#L45

So as to avoid these test failures in scala-ide

{noformat}
Failed tests:   throwsAnnotationOfClassConstructorsAndMethodsAreAvailableInJava_t100105(org.scalaide.core.structurebuilder.StructureBuilderTest): 
  throwsAnnotationOfTraitMethodsAreAvailableInJava_t1000707(org.scalaide.core.structurebuilder.StructureBuilderTest): 
  throwsAnnotationOfTraitMethodsAreAvailableInJava_t1000800(org.scalaide.core.structurebuilder.StructureBuilderTest): 
{noformat}

I tried:

{code}
      val typeNames = for(AnnotationInfo(_, List(t), _) <- throwsAnnotations)
        yield {
          javaTypeNameMono(t.tpe).toCharArray
        }
{code}

But this didn't work immediately, so I dropped the change from my PR and opened this ticket.

While we're looking at this, we should see if the IDE also needs an update for the recently added variant of `@throws` that that uses a type parameter:

{code}

scala> tb.typecheck(q"@throws[String] def foo = 0")
res4: tb.u.Tree = @throws[String](scala.this.throws.<init>$default$1[String]) def foo: Int = 0
{code}

Probably the IDE should use the extractor `AnnotationInfos.ThrownException` in the compiler, and we should update *that* in the commit that disables constant folding of `classOf` calls.
