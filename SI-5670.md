The Bash shell scripts in the 2.9.2 tarball do not have a+x permissions:

$ ls -l /opt/local/share/scala-2.9/bin/scala
-rwxr--r-- 1 root admin 4228 Apr 12 20:25 /opt/local/share/scala-2.9/bin/scala

This is annoying when one user installs Scala and another one wants to run Scala, such as in MacPorts' Scala package which I manage [1] where they are owned by root and normal users cannot run them.  Can the script that cuts new Scala releases be updated to fix the permissions on these files?

I tried to assign this to 2.9.2 but it's not listed yet.

Thanks,

Addressing all your points:

- We're using the tgz for MacPorts, so I wouldn't expect to need to modify permissions, just untarring should be sufficient.

- Regarding repackaging, MacPorts untars everything into a single directory in /opt/local/share/scala-2.9 and then creates symlinks from /opt/local/bin to the scripts.  This is laziness on my part so I don't have to modify any scripts.  Nice thing is, I don't need to worry about doing any work if there are changes to Scala's scripts.

- Thanks for the offer to build a MacPorts package, I don't know enough about that to say how it would be done.  I don't think it's necessary though as building a package is easy, see the existing Portfile [1], it just moves things into the proper location and creates some symlinks.  Also, MacPorts supports locations different than /opt/local, so I don't know how you handle that.

Ah I see.

Well, we have to make those changes for some other distributions, so bundling mac in the package isn't an issue.  I could also generate you a *specific* mac tgz to download in homebrew too.   Time is the only limit here.  

I'm going to be re-bundling the tool-support for Scala into the typesafe repositories shortly.  This means I'll be able to `yum install scala-bash-completion` and `apt-get install scala-gedit-support`, etc.  I'd love to have a quick & easy path to support macports for that.

Should we start a scala-dist mailing list to discuss these issues?
What do you mean "bundling mac in the package"?

I'm not a Homebrew user, so somebody else would need to manage that.

I know you guys are really busy, I would rather see work done on the language than work on packaging that can be handled by the packaging people, as it distributes work amongst the community.

It sounds like you want to host a MacPorts repository yourself?  MacPorts is only started having binary downloads and there isn't a fixed and public repository API yet that I would want to code to.  I don't know if MacPorts supports multiple repository URLs like yum and apt-get.

If you make a scala-dist list, I'll join it.  You'll need to decide if there's enough traffic and discussions to warrant it.  But since you're making your own yum and apt-get repositories, it sounds like there could be.
