This has some overlap with #8685, but that is a feature request and this is a bug report.
An non-overlapping fix: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4955

I think this is what the folks on reddit meant when they said, "I reported a bug and it was fixed within hours!" and "My bug was fixed before the cable guy showed up!"
