I've attached screenshot with illustration of broken syntax highlighting.

I use Scala 2.8.0 and following scala-mode:

{code}
(defconst scala-mode-version "0.5.99.5")
(defconst scala-mode-svn-revision "$$Revision: 21917 $$") 
{code}
I've seen similar ticket SI-1266, but it is 2 years old. May be Emacs 23 have more decent support for syntax? For example, python-mode does nice highlighting of multiline triple quoted string with " inside. See attached screenshot.
