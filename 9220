Very interesting. This is another manifestation of what we might call "the Array[Nothing]" problem, and that is that there are many places where type soundness depends on the fact that the type relationship will exist *between values*. You cannot instantiate a B unless it is an A, so a VALUE which is a B is safely an A. But Arrays especially, and also such things as ClassTags, mean that the type relationship will be evaluated WITHOUT values. And then it all breaks down. Without the value requirement, you can't say B <: A, because as one can see in the bytecode of B and A, it isn't and cannot be.
