This compiles in dotty (presumably because `Some("rd").getOrElse` is type checked with expected type String => Modifier). Can we make it work as well?

```scala
trait Modifier
implicit def stringNode(v: String): Modifier = ???
val s: Modifier = Some("rd").getOrElse("")
```

But not everyone has a list of scurrilous issues tattooed on the inside of their left biceps.

This will replace or at least supplement the related puzzler:

when the puzzler guys have returned from vacation.
