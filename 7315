Diffing debug output from first compile and second, the first line after the crash point in the non-crashing compile is
```
[log jvm] sig(apply, method apply, anonymous class F$mcL$sp$$anonfun$g$mcL$sp$1)      ()TR$sp;
```
So the surviving type parameter after anyref specialization (TR$sp) is referenced from a closure.

The other difference of note is that these two lines appear only in the crashing version:
```
< [log flatten] lifted anonymous class $anonfun$g$1 in trait F, unlinked anonymous class F$$anonfun$g$1
< [log flatten] lifted anonymous class $anonfun$g$mcL$sp$1 in trait F$mcL$sp, unlinked anonymous class F$mcL$sp$$anonfun$g$mcL$sp$1
```
