The library was designed to make it easy to switch from {{immutable}} collections to {{mutable}} ones. The behavior of '+', while a bit unintuitive to a new user, is still consistent with the rest of the library, and not weirder than chaining '+='. I still think the solution most in line with the current design is to have an immutable Buffer.
