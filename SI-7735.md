{code}
scala> case class Foo(x: Int, ys: Int*)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(5)
res0: Foo = Foo(5,WrappedArray())

scala> Foo(5, 10)
res1: Foo = Foo(5,WrappedArray(10))
{code}

We can't iterate through the elements and print them in general, given that we might have been constructed with:

{code}
  Foo(1, Stream.from(2): _*)
{code}

With this in mind, we might think about special casing `WrappedArray` to explode its elements. I'm not a fan of that inconsistency though.
