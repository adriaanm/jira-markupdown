The output will have "syntax error" in it on the non-crashing bad signatures, or throw an exception on the crashy ones.  I just ran that command line on every classfile under quick and picked through the output.

I'm writing a much nicer tool as we speak, but I may not get much more done today or this weekend as I have my kids to myself.
