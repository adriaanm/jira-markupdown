Using Scala 2.7.4, my code sample (attached) is correctly rejected by the compiler, but with the following erroneous message:

(fragment of test.scala):7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: java.lang.Object
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2Integer in object Predef of type (Int)java.lang.Integer
 and method intWrapper in object Predef of type (Int)scala.runtime.RichInt
 are possible conversion functions from Int to java.lang.Object
    for (batch <- List(List("foo", "bar", "baz", "glarf", "blah"))) { // compiler will complain about THIS line
          ^
one error found
!!!

I think it should be showing this line (and caret):

            { val c = counter; counter = 0; c }, // THIS is the actual error
            ^

This situation happened while I was working on a much more complex piece of code.  It took forever to pull things apart to discover the root-cause.  While this bug isn't a show-stopper, it's likely causing a bad/confusing user experience for many others.
