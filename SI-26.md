```scala
package pack

/** hello */
abstract class Foo {
  /** hola */
  var x:Int
}

/** hello */
class Bar extends Foo {
  /** hola */
  override var x = 3
}
```

documentation for Foo:x shows the setter and getter methods, and does not indicate that "there is an abstract vardef"

documentation for Bar:x is altogether missing

I would expect "abstract var x:Int" in documentation of Foo, and "var x" in definition of Bar.

[sean] I think NSC is doing some early transformations before or during type checking is completed that blow away all of this information. Vars never really exist, and we can't piece them back together very easily in Scaladoc.

[martin] nsc now marks setters and getters of abstract fields with the ABSTRACT flag. What's more, isSetter and isGetter (in Symbols.scala) now return true for such members. So, back to you, Sean...
