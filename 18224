```scala
object Test {
  object Bar {
    def apply(xs: List[Any]): Int = 0
    def test = apply(1)
  } 
  implicit def foo = 1
}
```
produces:
```scala
 found   : Int(1)
 required: List[Any]
 Note: implicit method foo is not applicable here because it comes after the application point and it lacks an explicit result type
    def test = apply(1)
                     ^
one error found
```
which is annoying and confusing. Maybe before producing the addendum we could force the completer and really check which of the implicits could be useful in that position?
Probably related to scala/bug#5265.
