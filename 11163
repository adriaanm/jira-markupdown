I am not keen on creating yet another logging library. JUL is part of J2SE and I'd be perfectly happy to send you a PR that simply replaces the current `println` usages in `Global` with the equivalent JUL debug/fine statements. For downstream users (like me, in ENSIME) we can trivially redirect JUL log messages to SLF4J and manage it there (e.g. with logback).

However, if you don't want to use JUL then at least removing the @inline and allowing these methods to be overridden should be good enough.

BTW I think there is some bug in the way the @inline methods are being interpreted. Even when my debug/verbose boolean vals are false (and I can check this), I still see some debug/verbose statements coming through on the terminal. It is just really really weird.
