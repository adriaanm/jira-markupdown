(This has parallels with "definite assignment analysis".
In the "{{g1 || g2 || g3 === true}}" case, we wouldn't expect the compiler to be happy with Java code like:
```scala
int i;
if (g1) {
 i = 1
} else if (g2) {
 i = 2
} else if (g3) {
 i = 3
}
println(i)
```

It is not considered a burden on developers that they need to "help" the compiler (and readers of their code) by changing the last block to an "else", like:
```scala
int i;
if (g1) {
 i = 1
} else if (g2) {
 i = 2
} else {
 i = 3
}
println(i)
```

I think this is how people expect the compiler to behave in this case.)
