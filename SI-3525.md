The following program worked in 2.7, does not work on Windows in 2.8:
{code}
import scala.io.Source
  
object LongLines {
  def processFile(filename: String, width: Int) {
	val source = Source.fromPath(filename)
	println(compat.Platform.EOL.charAt(0).toInt)
	println("\n".charAt(0).toInt)
	for (line <- source.getLines()) {
	  processLine(filename, width, line)
	}
  }
  def processLine(filename: String, width: Int, line: String) {
    if (line.length > width) println(filename+": "+line)
  }
}

object FindLongLines {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
	val width = args(0).toInt
	for (arg <- args.drop(1))
	  LongLines.processFile(arg, width)
  }
}
{code}
The problem is that `getLines()` reads in the whole input file as a single line. Investigation shows that `getLines()` expands to 
getLines(compat.Platform.EOL), which expands to a CR character on windows(!!!). Doing an explicit getLines("\n") works. 

Something is clearly wrong here. I suspect it's the `lineSeparator` property, which is `propOrElse("line.separator", "\n")`. Probably it should be always "\n". Or else the default argument for `getLines` is wrong. 

In any case we cannot release 2.8 like this. This is very basic functionality, which we cannot afford it to break between 2.7 and 2.8.

Since this involves several components I am not sure who's best to handle this. I assign to you Paul, but feel free to pass it on if you think there's a better expert on this.


Nobody has ever been very happy with the default argument to getLines, that is a certainty.  It manages to fail to cover the common "don't care" case while at the same time breaking another thing which you might not like, in that
{code}
// this worked in 2.7, not now
file.getLines
{code}
because once there are default arguments you can't omit the parameter list entirely, you have to give empty parens.

So I'm going to remove the default argument and make it like 2.7.  The expert I'd want to hand this off to, who as yet I don't know exists, is the guy who knows enough about all the platform-specific inanity to see through the haze to the least bad platform compromise.
