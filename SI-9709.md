```
[~retronym] Our next step towards this is to standardize on `-Yclasspath:flat`, which is more memory efficient than the older, default `-Yclasspath:recursive`. This will reduce the surface area of the compiler that interacts with Zip files. We plan to flip the default to `flat` this week as part of 2.12.0-M4, then remove the old implementation by 2.12.0-M5.
