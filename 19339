Unfortunately, it is not easy for Scala beginners to find any beginner tickets to start with, if they want to help out.

E.g. this site: http://www.scala-lang.org/contribute/community-tickets.html stays empty. The consequense are bad public opinion, like this one on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kf/status/516465578731528192
