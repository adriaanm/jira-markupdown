[~ichoran] Could you share a benchmark that shows the biggest difference?

I've played with a few variations in https://github.com/retronym/compiler-benchmark/commit/a2260bb927572ce606aafffed92c14ed5ffdf6bf

I don't have a clear model about what's going on here.

One observation is that the new trait encoding requires some additional indirections which can eat into HotSpot's inlining depth budget, which is by default 9. I'm trying things like looking at the effect of `-XX:MaxInlineLevel=16` in the 2.12.0 run.
