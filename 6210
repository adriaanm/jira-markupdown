The way I read the spec (this corrects my previous comment):

 * (1) {{f(x: X)}} is *not* as specific as (2) {{f(ys: Y*)}} because (2) cannot be applied to arguments {{(p)}} of type {{(X)}}.
 * (2) is *not* as specific as (1), because (1) cannot be applied to arguments {{(p)}} of type {{(Y*)}}. (*)

(*) There are no values of type {{T*}} in Scala. The implementation of {{isAsSpecific}} in {{Infer.scala}} uses the underlying type {{T}}, but only if both method types that are being compared have a vararg-parameter.

 * the relative weight of (1) over (2) is 0
 * the relative weight of (2) over (1) is 0

 * therefore there is no most specific, the call is ambiguous.

So I vote for closing this as "Not a Bug".
