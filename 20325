If environment variable JAVA_HOME is unset (like it's supposed to be) then when scala and scalac get to these lines [added in bfa7ade0db](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/bfa7ade0db) ...
```scala
  # Note that the version numbers go 1.7, 1.8, 9, 10, ...
  java_release="$(cat $JAVA_HOME/release | grep JAVA_VERSION)"
```
...it's the empty string and that translates into `cat /release` which obviously doesn't exist. So,
```scala
% /p/inst/scala-2.12.1/bin/scala
cat: /release: No such file or directory
