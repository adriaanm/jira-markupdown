=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
class A {
  val n="n"
  val temp : String = this.n
 
}
class O extends A {
  override val n="foo"

}


object Main {

    /**
     * @param args the command line arguments
     */
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      val o = new O
      println(o.n)
      println(o.temp)

    }
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

In output console I should read:

foo
n 





=== What do you see instead? ===

When I run this main I get:

No changes to recompile
compile:
run:
foo
null
BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 3 seconds)
