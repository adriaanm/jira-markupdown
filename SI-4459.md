=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
object Foo {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    foo((0 until 10000).toSeq.par)
  }

  def foo(arg: Seq[_]): String = arg.map(x => x).mkString(",")
}
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Program executes and exits without output.


=== What do you see instead? ===

An exception (sometimes NPE, other times ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException), I paste the top of it and attach the full stacktrace because it's very large.

scala.collection.parallel.package$$CompositeThrowable: Multiple exceptions thrown during a parallel computation: (java.lang.NullPointerException

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24708-b20110408020244
