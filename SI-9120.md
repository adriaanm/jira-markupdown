Proposing a light-weight implementation of 'break' and 'continue' that operate inside of sequence comprehensions, as specialized breakable generators.

The concept is written up here:
http://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/monadic-break-and-continue-for-scala-sequence-comprehensions/

A simple example of what they look like in use:

{code: scala}
object Main {
  import scala.util.control.BreakableGenerators._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val r = for (
      // generate a breakable sequence from some sequential input
      loop <- breakable(1 to 1000);
      // iterate over the breakable sequence
      j <- loop;
      // print out at each iteration
      _ = { println(s"iteration j= $j") };
      // continue to next iteration when 'j' is even
      if { j % 2 == 0 } continue;
      // break out of the loop when 'j' exceeds 5
      if { j > 5 } break(loop) 
    ) yield {
      j
    }
    println(s"result= ${r.toList}")
  }
}
{code}

Can you provide a bit more motivation for why it is important to have this syntax?

For instance, your for-loop could be more easily expressed by

```scala
val r = (1 to 1000).iterator.
  map{ j => println(s"iteration j = $j") }.
  filterNot(j => (j % 2) == 0).
  takeWhile(_ <= 5)
```

If you are making instead an argument about efficiency, it would help to show benchmarks.  It is far from clear that your approach yields a nice tradeoff between speed and power (i.e. as much of both as possible).
The particular examples I've been using were chosen for ease of understanding, as opposed to motivation.   The motivating cases are loops having multiple exit points, and/or continuation points.  (`continue` itself is just the inversion of a regular `if` guard, I just included it for completeness).

Another way of looking at it: motivation is more or less the same as the already-existing `scala.util.control.Breaks`, but: (a) not requiring `throw/catch` under the hood, and (b) all looping constructs remain nicely scoped inside the `for` construct.

The times I, personally, find myself wanting `break` and/or `continue`, are usually numeric or other complex looping algorithms where there are often multiple conditions that might indicate loop halting, and those conditions are best tested at varying points in the code, which makes `break`/`continue` tests a nice representation; they can be dropped in wherever they are warranted, without breaking up the main flow of the code.   Other use cases include loops involving many varieties of error checking that become relevant at multiple points in the progress of the main looping body.
Since `continue` is just an inversion of `if`, is it actually important to have?

Also, can you give an example which is not more compactly expressed with `takeWhile` and a regular iterator?

I think it is valuable to have multiple ways to do things as long as some of them are clearly superior in some cases.  But otherwise it seems to be a net negative (Perl vs. Python for instance) to have many different approximately equivalent ways to do the same thing: it makes reading code harder since the code-to-intent map is more complex.

FWIW, the normal breakable/break provides a way to exit closures and such that has less boilerplate and is faster than the stackless exception-based return that the compiler will give you.  A similarly compelling story here (whether for speed or clarity or both or something else) would be nice to have.  Also, any advantage has to be weighed against the potential for accidental consumption of the `loop` iterator.
Played around with it a little more--correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the behavior of `break(outer)` kind of nonintuitive in nested loops?  I would naively expect it to immediately break out of the outer context, but it looks to me like it means something like "finish the inner loop, but don't run any more iterations on the outer loop after that".

Except it's a little more fiddly because anything where `break(outer)` is triggered will be filtered out of the inner loop.  So if you *consistently* break on the rest of the inner loop, you actually act as if you broke out of both loops.  But otherwise it acts like a filter only on the last iteration.
Correct, if you say `break(outer)` instead of `break(inner, outer)`, it doesn't have any scoping knowledge to say "oh, I should probably also break out of `inner` as well."    It would be pretty easy to support something like `inner <- breakable(data)(outer)`, so that `outer` could know to halt `inner` if it was broken.  But that isn't enforceable either, of course.  I could maintain a stack internal to `BreakableGenerators`. I'd have to think through whether that causes any concurrency-safety issues.  Past that, it's getting into compiler support, I think.
Others may feel differently, but I am not yet convinced that this addition to the library is desirable.

Upsides:
  * convenient early termination in for comprehensions
  * complements breakable/break in that it works with yield

Downsides:
  * fragile syntax (perhaps at least partially fixable)
  * more ways to do the same thing (learning / maintenance cost goes up)
  * more boilerplate than existing ways to do it

It may be just the thing for some users, which argues for it being part of *some* library, but not necessarily the standard library.
Rex, thanks for trying it out!   I have a few ideas about how to make it more robust.   If that pans out, I'll update the PR.
I came up with a different design that meets all my goals for API and semantics.   I published it as a 3rd-party package, but it might be interesting to the scala-lang community:
