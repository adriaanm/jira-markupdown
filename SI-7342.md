```scala
object Test {

  trait Foo

  trait TC[A]

  object TC {
    implicit def tc1[F <: Foo] = new TC[F] {}
    implicit def tc2[F1 <: Foo, F2 <: Foo] = new TC[(F1, F2)] {}
  }   

  object Bar {
    trait X
    val c = new Foo with X
    def bar[A](a: this.type => A)(implicit tc: TC[A]) = 1
  }

  Bar bar (_.c)

  Bar bar (b => (b.c, b.c))  // <- does not compile

  Bar bar (b => (b.c: Foo, b.c))
}
```
The next-to-last line does not compile due to implicit not being found. The last line compiles. It seems that the type of b.c is inferred to be Foo with b.X instead of Foo with Bar.X.
This looks like a problem with non-wildcard existentials. Simplified version without implicits:

```scala
trait Foo
 
trait TC[A]

class Bar {
  trait X
  val c = new Foo with X
}

object Test7342 {
  def tc2[F1 <: Foo, F2 <: Foo]: TC[(F1, F2)] = null
 
  def bar[A](a: Bar => A)(tc: TC[A]) = 1

  bar(b => (b.c, b.c))(tc2) // fails
  bar(b => (b.c: Foo, b.c))(tc2) // ok
}
```

`A` in `bar` is inferred from the first argument only, so it comes down to typechecking `tc2` with the expected type. Minimized version:

```scala
trait TC[A] // works with +A

class Bar { trait X }

object Test7342 {
  def tc2[F1, F2]: TC[(F1, F2)] = null
 
  tc2: TC[(b.X forSome { val b: Bar }, b.X forSome { val b: Bar })] // ok
  tc2: TC[(b.X, b.X) forSome { val b: Bar }] // fails
}
```

IMHO this not a bug but a limitation of Scala's type system because there is no way to express a type application of `tc2` with a common existential quantification over both type arguments.
