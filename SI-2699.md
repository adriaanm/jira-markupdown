Using the file indent scala.vim causes code like the following to fail. (This code is a snippet taken from the end of chapter 3 in Programming in Scala by Odersky, Spoon and Venners)


import scala.io.Source
def widthOfLength(s: String) = s.Length.toString.toString

if (args.length > 0) {
  val lines = Source.fromFile(args(0)).getLines.toList
  val longestLine = lines.reduceLeft(
    (a, b) => if (a.length > b.length) a else b
  ) <<<<<< HERE
  ...
}


After typing the close parenthesis in the marked line, the scala.vim file sees mis-matched parens after calling CountParens, and thinks it must dedent.

I propose modifying the lines at and following 56 so that it looks as such:

  " If parenthesis are unbalanced, indent or dedent
  " but only if prevline contains more than a close
  " parenthesis and (optionally) comments
  if prevline !~ '^\s*)\s*\(\/\/.*\|\/\*.*\*\/\)*$$'
    let c = CountParens(prevline)
    echo c
    if c > 0
      let ind = ind + &shiftwidth
    elseif c < 0
      let ind = ind - &shiftwidth
    endif
  endif

Adding the extra if block to test if the line contains more than just a close parenthesis and (optionally) a comment will prevent it from errantly dedenting when the script thinks it has a mismatched paren (when really it does match, just not on the same line).
Hello Stepan, I believe you usually take care of the vim support files. Could you please review the patch provided by bwaskiew in ticket SI-2699 and commit it if all is ok?
Thanks! Toni
