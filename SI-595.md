The !SyncChannel implementation is broken. Consider the following program:

```scala
import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.ops._

object Program extends Application {
  val c = new SyncChannel[unit]
  par({ c.write(()) }, { Thread.sleep(1000); c.read })
}
```

The write call will wait forever.

Also, the text on !SyncChannel in !ScalaByExample is inconsistent with the code. The text speaks of three signals, but only two variables are waited on.
Note that the test case is incorrect, due to bug #746. 

A correct test case for this is 

```scala
import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.ops._

object Program {
  def main(args : Array[String]) = {
    val c = new SyncChannel[unit]
    par({ c.write(()) }, { Thread.sleep(1000); c.read })
  }
}
```
