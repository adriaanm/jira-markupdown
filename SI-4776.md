In revision 21018, {{filterKeys}} and {{mapValues}} started returning map views in everything but name. This cause a few problems, however -- the lack of a distinct type does not help identifying them as returning non-strict collections, and they lack a {{force}} method to retrieve a strict collection.

I'd suggest returning a {{MapView}}, but there isn't any such collection at the moment -- {{view}} returns an {{IterableView}} instead. Perhaps the ideal would be to create a {{MapView}}, and make {{filterKeys}} and {{mapValues}} only non-strict in them.
Bumped into this in 2.9.2 and thought, "I'll just throw {{.seq}} onto the result".  It doesn't work.  Basically {{.mapView}} and {{.filterKeys}} are still lazy with no way to _force_.  It's true `Map` extends GenMap and so I have only myself to blame but it was a bit of a nasty surprise.
Shouldn't we have to ask for a view if we want one?

Realistically, I think nothing will ever be done about this because it would break too much existing code that relies on the lazy behavior. So maybe the best way forward would be to add eager methods with a similar name? 

In the new scala.collection.mutable.LongMap/AnyRefMap, @Ichoran added a method *mapValuesNow* . Maybe we should just add *mapValuesNow* and *filterKeysNow* to the map interface and implement it in the other collections? For immutable.HashMap, mapValuesNow would be easy to implement and very efficient.
BTW, {{mapValues}} seems somehow slated for renaming: http://www.scala-lang.org/news/roadmap-next.

One could still change the return type to be more specific, like MapView (which somebody should write) or sth. like FilterMonadic — that would *add* a force method, and this would help for instance for SI-7005.

That's something which is possible in addition, and much easier because it wouldn't require implementing MapView.

It takes more time to write tests than actually making this right:
{code}
Map[K, A] ... {
def mapValuesNow(f: A => B): Map[K, B] = map { case (a, b) => (a, f(b)) }
}
{code}
Or Rüdiger, are you thinking of something more efficient?
If so, I suspect it should apply also to immutable.Map, since it is rather close to immutable.HashMap (I never understood the point of the difference, since a Map with size > 4 is a HashMap anyway, and before they follow the same structure).
Here's an example of how this can lead to surprising runtime results: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9499
This ticket is nr. 7 both in terms of Votes and Watchers. Right there with "implement higher-order unification for type-constructor inference" and for-comprehension performance. While those tickets are technically very challenging, this one is more about reaching a decision and acting on it.

In an ideal world {{filterKeys}} would behave like {{filter}} and {{mapValues}} would behave like {{map}}. Unfortunately, the documentation promises that no elements are copied, and that restricts the implementation to pretty much the current one.

We could:

- change to strict behavior and break some clients. This could be done in Scala 3.0
- deprecate {{filterKeys}} and {{mapValues}} and create two other methods with explicit strict/lazy behavior, {{filterKeysNow}} and {{withFilterKeys}} à la {{FilterMonadic}}.
- add a specific return type. However, as long as that type is a subtype of {{Map}} we won't gain much, as it's unlikely people would use an explicit type to store the result of {{filter}}. This will go unnoticed in most of the cases.

The second choice sounds the most reasonable to me. Thoughts?
[~pggiarrusso] yes, I meant the same for {{mapValues}}
I'd love to see a proposal 2 implemented. I'd suggest:

# Create {{valueMap}} and {{keyFilter}} that are strict versions of the above.
# Deprecate {{mapValues}} and {{filterKeys}}, adding a deprecation note that users should use {{.view.mapValues}} and {{.view.filterKeys}} respectively.

This would keep the library standardized, supplying only strict implementations, allowing users to explicitly use non-strict versions if they see fit.
I strongly believe deprecation is essential to proposal #2. IMO the main issue that needs resolution is warning people about {{filterKeys}} being lazy. If they already know they need a strict version they're not going to be bitten by this bug (I still call it a bug, since filter and filterKeys should behave the same way, likewise for map/mapValues).
I agree with [~ichoran] that "adding strict alternative" is technically orthogonal to the deprecation. So IMHO* somebody could already start implementing that, following Rüdiger's plans. (Even if we wouldn't do #2, we'll need the same implementations).

But [~dragos] is right if the overall goal of the bug is not "offer both behaviors at all" but "fix latent bugs where clients use the lazy variant but shouldn't". Under *that* goal, deprecation is essential to the overall goal. I think that's a good goal, since Scala tries to reduce pitfalls. The only downside is that some users will have to change their code just to confirm they mean to use the lazy version.
