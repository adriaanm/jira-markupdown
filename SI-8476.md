In the following case no warning should be shown:

{code}
scala> """ s"${fo}" """
<console>:8: warning: That looks like an interpolated expression! Did you forget the interpolator?
       """ s"${fo}" """
       ^
res0: String = " s"${fo}" "

{code}
what is this "feature" and how do we turn it off? We have a warning intolerant build and use this kind of thing for instance [using the Typesafe Config library|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/kadai/src/ed11665c6e0e7bdfe1b269c87261428e41a2eea5/config/src/test/scala/kadai/config/ConfigurationSpec.scala?at=master#cl-88].

Is there a macro that performs no interpolation and avoids this warning?
High on our todo list is to add a config option to let you filter out warnings. Hopefully in 2.11.1.

There is a tension between adding a -Yoption for each warning (maximum flexibility) vs lumping many warnings under `Xlint` (easier discoverability, smaller command line API).

In the meantime, you can do this yourself in SBT. I remember I helped [~puffnfresh] configure this a month or so ago. I'll try to dig up the example.
It is in the comments of: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8410
Thanks [~retronym], appreciate the feedback. The suggested approach is a bit heavyweight for this though.

And, my objection to this specific warning as a valid thing stands.
It has revealed quite a few bugs, so it has value. But I agree that it needs to be configurable. I guess you can break up your strings in the mean time if you don't have too many. Or maybe

{code}
"""  @{foo} """.replaceAllLiterally("@", "$").
{code}
