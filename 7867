Ok, I spent more time on it and we indeed generate wrong signatures for method (that do not agree with generic signatures). I created a separate ticket to track progress on it:
scala/bug#6101

It contains truly minimized test-case.

I'll assign both tickets to Alex as this is purely specialization problem.
