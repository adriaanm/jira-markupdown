In a macro implementation, a dependent type x.T maps to c.Expr[x.value.T]. But presently, applying a dependent type to some type constructor C[x.T] does not map to c.Expr[C[x.value.T]]. SIP 16 defines the type transformation as follows:

```
σ is a substitution that maps every type parameter of MI to the corresponding type argument in the body of the macro call, and that maps every value parameter x of MD to x’.value, where x’ is the corresponding value parameter in MI (which is also named x).
```

Should this transformation apply recursively to type parameters and type refinements of macro argument and return types? Intuitively, it seems like it should. I'm unclear as to whether the notation in the spec implies this. The compiler currently behaves as follows:

```scala
class X { type T }

object X {
  // this works
  def foo(x: X): x.T = macro fooImpl
  def fooImpl(c: Context)(x: c.Expr[X]): c.Expr[x.value.T] = ???
  
  // this doesn't
  def bar(x: X, y: X): (x.T, y.T) = macro barImpl
  def barImpl(c: Context)(x: c.Expr[X], y: c.Expr[X]): c.Expr[(x.value.T, y.value.T)] = ???
  
  // neither does this
  def baz(x: X)(xs: List[x.T]): Unit = macro bazImpl
  def bazImpl(c: Context)(x: c.Expr[X])(xs: c.Expr[List[x.value.T]]): c.Expr[Unit] = ???
}
```

```
macro implementation has wrong shape:
 required: (c: scala.reflect.macros.Context)(x: c.Expr[X], y: c.Expr[X]): c.Expr[(x.T, y.T)]
 found   : (c: scala.reflect.macros.Context)(x: c.Expr[X], y: c.Expr[X]): c.Expr[(x.value.T, y.value.T)]
type mismatch for return type: c.Expr[(x.value.T, y.value.T)] does not conform to c.Expr[(x.T, y.T)]
  def bar(x: X, y: X): (x.T, y.T) = macro barImpl
                                          ^

Tested with Scala-2.10.0-SNAPSHOT dated 2012-9-26.
The given example does not appear to work in 2.10.3. Any chance for a backport?

The downside of a backport is that this bug can be worked around in some cases, but the workaround requires writing incorrect code, which would stop working under this fix.

If a backport is impossible, I'd be happy with the bug marked as such — instead of the backport label, maybe we need an analogue of "Won't fix", say "Can't backport".

In particular, If the type is a member of the receiver object, the problem can be worked around by using the incorrect `DestObject.Type` instead of `c.prefix.value.Type`:

(But more seriously, I found an orthogonal bug in the same transform in 2.11.0-M8/RC1 — #8356).
> Speaking of regressions, is the one that you've found reproducible for 2.11.0-RC1?
It's reproducible on RC1, but I was too hasty to call it a regression, it's also on 2.10.3. See #8356, which I just assigned to you.
@xeno-by The given example code works on both 2.11.7 and 2.12.0-M3, should this ticket be updated with new examples or is #8356 enough and this can be closed?
