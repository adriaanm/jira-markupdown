Would be handy to define packages in the REPL to quickly test semantics depending on packages like access modifiers. Now all you can do is create a file and test it with the compiler.

scala> package a {
<console>:1: error: illegal start of definition
       package a {
       ^

scala> package a
<console>:1: error: illegal start of definition
       package a
       ^

You can use raw paste for this use case. That's paste fresh from the can.

{code}
scala> :paste -raw
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

package base {
  class Y { val context = "package base" }
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.


scala> new base.Y().context
res0: String = package base
{code}

Closing this as {{:paste -raw}} is sufficient.
