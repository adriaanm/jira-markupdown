The regression wasn't caught, because there are currently no "real" tests for floating point ranges where 
either start, end or step would be different from a whole integer. This is a problem especially since the current
NumericRange.count method has fully separate code for "effectively integer" ranges and so actually most of the logic
in count seems to have no tests.

Suggestion: I will add a bunch more tests for possible NumericRange pitfalls.

2.10.x seems to do num.toLong(num.quot(...)) which avoids the problem, but that was generalized away in 994de8ff.
