That sounds like you're trying to generate Scaladoc from _Javadoc_ comments in Java sources.

What I had in mind was to generate Scaladoc from _Scaladoc_ comments in Java sources.

I'm sure there are advantages both ways. But a huge advantage of the latter approach is that I would think it would be easier to do, since Scaladoc already understands Scaladoc format, but doesn't know the Javadoc format.

Without going back and looking, I'm not sure which approach r22605 actually took.
