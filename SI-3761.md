The by-value methods can be handled by not the by-name methods.
I'm preparing a pull for this issue and #4728.

(This bug had to do with the specificity test trying to apply info1(=>String) to (String); the other bug with expanding the vararg in the same test.)

The fixes addressing the bugs were straightforward, but I got ambitious.  Namely, I'd like this to work:
```scala
class Tri {
  def foo(m: =>String,n: =>String) = m +" "+ n + "!"
  def foo(m: =>String,n: String) = m +" "+ n + "!!"
  def foo(m: String,n: =>String) = m +" "+ n + "!!!"
  def foo(m: String,n: String) = m +" "+ n + "!!!!"

  // match on foo(String,=>String)
  def bar(m: String,n: =>String) = foo(m,n)
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val tri = new Tri
    println(tri.bar("hello","world"))
  }
}
```
The motivation is that you can overload m(A) and m(=>A) but then it's difficult to disambiguate in client code because you can't name =>A as in hypothetical application m(null: =>A).  You get your by-name API back by using a different interface or a proxy method as above, if the proxy would select the args that match best.

The spec is actually silent on this issue.  If =>A is not selected on shape (as though it were ()=>A, it seems to me that m(=>A) is more specific than m(A) [since we can apply m(=>A) to (A) only by a special case and not by a conversion].  Whatever, that's not intuitive.

My patch adds a tie-breaker where the winner has to match the by-namedness of the applied args exactly. See above.

This is an edge case, but has the benefit of being simple and enabling something that's otherwise hard (without putting a can-opener to the complexity worms gathering dust in the tackle box).

The behavior described in the previous comment is under a private option -Yresolve-by-name.

As described in the commit, the patch is to handle isCompatible test for A and =>A explicitly.
No.  Is there something to remedy in SI-1386?  (Rhetorical question.)

lrytz merged commit 94e5d76

The patch doesn't include the variant overloading resolution. Sniff.
