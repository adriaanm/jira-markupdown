It seems in 2857d43a5a (four months ago) we took on a dependency on tools.jar. Maybe that's the best thing to do, but I don't remember it being discussed. I hear that it causes some kind of issue with building the IDE, although I don't know why we wouldn't have heard about it before now.
Does dependency mean compile or run time?  I recall that the dependency is optionally run time, i.e., it should fail gracefully if tools.jar is lacking, which is the old behavior.  I should add a test for that.

Footnote, javax.tools is not tools.jar.

The error Eugene mentioned on the ML was:

Unfortunately my attempts to test scala-IDE locally with 2.11.0-SNAPSHOT failed:

 "Unable to satisfy dependency from org.scala-ide.scala.compiler
2.11.0.v20130225-064029-f2be783020 to package javax.tools 0.0.0.", "No
solution found because the problem is unsatisfiable."]
