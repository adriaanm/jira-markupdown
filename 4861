With respect to r23184, for both of my patches, I ran:
{code}
 ant all.clean test
{code}
and
{code}
 ant all.clean test-opt
{code}
and neither caused any failures.  Is this the right thing to be running?  I realize I didn't run it against your exact commit, but I wanted to check the basic ideas independently.
