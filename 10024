Further reduced:
```scala
package pack

object Named {
  import O.empty
  def foo(empty: Any): Any = ???
  // is `empty` a named arg or an assignment? Checking for that has nasty side effects!
  foo(empty = ???)
}

object O {
  // order matters (!!!)
  def empty(implicit a: Any): Any = ???
  def empty[E]: C[E] = ???
}

abstract class C[E] {
  def foo[BB](f: BB)
  def test[B](f: B): Any = foo(f)
}
```
