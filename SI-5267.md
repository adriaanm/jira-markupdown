Scala 2.9 introduced partial specialization (add `AnyRef` to the list of `@specialized` targets). However this wasn't employed in any of the handful of specialized classes in the standard library.

I think this would be a valuable addition to `Function1`. Without this, I recently resorted to:

```scala
abstract class Function1ADouble[A] extends Function1[A, Double] {
  def apply(a: A): Double
}

def mapSum[A](as: Iterable[A])(f: Function1ADouble[A]): Double = {
    var sum = 0d
    val iterator = as.iterator
    while (iterator.hasNext) {
      sum += f.apply(iterator.next())
    }
    sum
}
```
}

`Function2` might also be a candidate, although it will add more weight.
Hi

Just wanted to ask what is the status of partial Function1 specialization - this ticket seems closed/resolved, while Function1 in scala 2.11.2 doesn't seem to be AnyRef specialized...

Unfortunately AnyRef specialization had to be removed from `Functions` in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/cc3badae17e. Discussion of the problems it caused is here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/5P5TS9ZWe_w/39S8q1WJYF8J.

We don't have plans to revisit this in forseeable future.

What we do have, however, is experimental support for SAMs in Scala 2.11.

```scala
scala> trait IntFunction[A] { def apply(i: A): Int }
defined trait IntFunction

scala> def sum[T](as: Traversable[T])(f: IntFunction[T]) = { var sum = 0; as foreach (a => sum += f(a)); sum }
sum: [T](as: Traversable[T])(f: IntFunction[T])Int

scala> sum(List("a", "bc"))(_.length)
res2: Int = 3
```

No boxing is needed here.
