Consider this:
{code}import scala.concurrent.duration._

trait Foo { implicit val timeout = 1 second }
trait Bar extends Foo { implicit override val timeout = 2 seconds }
```scala

In 2.10.0-RC2 and 2.10.0-RC3, the implicit conversion that gives the seconds method to Int fails:

defined trait Foo
<console>:11: error: value seconds is not a member of Int
       trait Bar extends Foo { implicit override val timeout = 2 seconds }
                                                                 ^
{code}

When the implicit keyword is removed from the overridden val, the implicit conversion works properly.
For some reason if the overriding implicit is typed without an expected type, the failure is reported. It looks to me like it proceeds to type the override with an expected type of Int, at which point it finds the implicit, but it's too late. Supposed to be a silent context being used somewhere?
```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

trait Foo { implicit val v: Duration = 1.seconds }
trait Bar1 extends Foo { override implicit val v = 2.seconds } // fails
trait Bar2 extends Foo { override implicit val v: Duration = 2.seconds } // compiles
```
I'm looking into this. My test case:

```scala
object O {
  implicit def i: Int = 0
}

import O._
 
trait Foo {
  implicit val v1: Any
  implicit val d1: Any
           val v2: Any
  implicit val v3: Any
}

trait Bar1 extends Foo {
  implicit val v1      = {implicitly[Int]; ()} // fail
           def d1      = {implicitly[Int]; ()} // okay
  implicit val v2      = {implicitly[Int]; ()} // okay
  implicit val v3: Any = {implicitly[Int]; ()} // okay

}

```
