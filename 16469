This example is really weird
```scala
class O {
  def +(x: O): O = null
}
object O {
  implicit def i2o(x: Int): O = null
}
object M {
  val o : O = null
  1 + o //1.+(o) won't compile
}
```
This shouldn't compile in both cases. According to language specification implicit scope for e.v(args) is type of e. Here type of e is Int, so i2o can't be in implicit scope.
So this is possibly bug of lang specification, I mean implicit scope actually is bigger then Int.
However anyway it's compiler bug, because both exmples should be the same (infix operations is just syntactic sugar).
