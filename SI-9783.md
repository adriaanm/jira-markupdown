scala-reflect library initialization takes over 600 milliseconds on my machine. When using sbt-revolver plugin for faster dev turnaround, it is a lot.

See attached test.

```scala
sergey@sergey:/tmp/1$ sbt run
[info] Loading global plugins from /home/sergey/.sbt/0.13/plugins
[info] Set current project to root-1 (in build file:/tmp/1/)
[info] Running Test 
time: 704ms
