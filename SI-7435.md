Consider the following from the repl:

```
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_09).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> object Test {
     |   def init(implicit s: String) = s
     |   val foo = init
     |   implicit val bar: String = "hi"
     | }
defined module Test

scala> Test.foo
res0: String = null
```

I would expect this to fail to compile, since `bar` is going to be initialised after `foo`, and so therefore should not be considered a candidate implicit parameter to `init`.

If you allow the type of `bar` to be inferred (remove the explicit String type), the code does fail to compile, as expected.
