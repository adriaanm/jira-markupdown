Hi
I'm struggling with compilation errors when trying to put vals to Java annotations.
There's @FindBy annotation of Selenium framework that expects static string parameters and I'm unable to keep these parameters in vals or final vals.

Here's the example:

{{
final val xpathString = "//div"

  @FindBy(How.XPATH, using = xpathString)
  var element : WebElement = _}}

I'm getting this when compiling:

{{[error] /home/kuba/sample_repo/src/main/scala/com/sampletest/toTest.scala:15: classfile annotation arguments have to be supplied as named arguments
[error]   @FindBy(How.XPATH, using = xpathString)}}

The only way is to put these strings directly into annotation parameters.
Any ideas?
