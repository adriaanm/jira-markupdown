Any kind of inner class seems to be inaccessible to C# code in Visual studio, as a result using Scala code from MSIL is limited.
Bumping this to high because of its annoyance factor. Here is how to fix:

A nested class in MSIL is simply defined inside .class body of its containing body, so:

.namespace 'lofi'
{
    .class public auto ansi 'Test'
           extends    [mscorlib]'System.Object'
           implements [predef]'scala.ScalaObject'
    {
      .class public auto ansi abstract 'Foo'
             extends    [mscorlib]'System.Object'
             implements [predef]'scala.ScalaObject' {}

    }
}

This is the extern. When Foo is defined, it must also be inside Test's body!

When you refer to Foo, use a forward slash; e.g., lofi.Test/Foo. Do not surround the / in single quotes! Instead, use 'lofi.Test'/'Foo' to refer to a nested class with quoting. $$ should still be used to mangle names of classes that are not the child of another class, but note that any type name with $$ in it is invisible to .NET!
