This has come up several times now: People coming from Python expect to instantiate objects without `new` which for them in Scala mysteriously works sometimes and sometimes not.

Could we improve the error message for this case hinting them at the solution?
This is a duplicate of #2925, which is assigned to me. Thanks for the patch--I'll verify and incorporate.
