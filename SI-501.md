I have been compiling SCALA-MINA with the new  compiler 2.7.0 rc2 I got 4 errors, among those errors, there was a file call CallResult.scala, it did not compiled.

I have isolated the problem in a file. when compile with the package name org.kow I get no problem, it compiles correctly. when I use package name org.scala it thows the following errors :
C:\Documents and Settings\renghen\Desktop>c:\scala-2.7.0-RC2\bin\scalac.bat test.scala
test.scala:18: error: type Nothing is not a member of package org.scala
case class OK[T](value:T) extends CallResult[T]
              ^
test.scala:26: error: type Nothing is not a member of package org.scala
case class Error[T](reason:Any) extends CallResult[T]
                 ^
two errors found
