J.java:
```scala
class J { static void foo(Class c) { } }
```

S.scala:
```scala
object S { J.foo(null) }
```

transcript showing separate compilation with javac works and the error when you try to pass both files to scalac:
```scala
  ~/newbug> javac J.java
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac S.scala       
  ~/newbug> rm *.class                             
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac J.java S.scala
J.java:1: error: class Class takes type parameters
class J { static void foo(Class c) { } }
                          ^
one error found
```

I'm running r15724.

This bug is especially toxic at the moment because the obvious workaround of changing Class to Class<?> tends (for me, at least) to trigger bug #1176. The only reason I even discovered this bug was because I was trying to work around #1176.
These are becoming ever hairier problems. It looks like the original approach of simply providing a Java->Scala parser has limitations. There seem to be lots of places where later phases of the compiler have to be adapted. That's a lot of work, and I won't be able to do it. So I think we have to put this effort on hold until we find a volunteer to do this.
