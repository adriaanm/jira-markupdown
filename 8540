I don't see this as a duplicate; those are bugs which deal with default arguments for implicit parameters _in the unapply method_; i.e. with arguments _supplied to_ the pattern matcher, not the _results from_ the pattern matcher. Anyway, my main case is named arguments which is unrelated to those issues.
