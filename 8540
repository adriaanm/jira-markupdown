I don't see this as a duplicate; those are bugs which deal with default arguments for implicit parameters *in the unapply method*; i.e. with arguments *supplied to* the pattern matcher, not the *results from* the pattern matcher. Anyway, my main case is named arguments which is unrelated to those issues.
