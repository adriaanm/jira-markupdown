But only if the former is an abstract trait member implemented by a subtype:

```scala
trait Bunny {
  def foo(a: Int = 4, b: Int = 2): String
  def foo: String = foo()
}

object Little extends Bunny {
  def foo(a: Int, b: Int) = a.toString + b.toString
}

object Test {
  Little.foo // ambiguous reference to overloaded definition
}
```

However:

```scala
trait Bunny {
  def foo(a: Int = 4, b: Int = 2): String = a.toString + b.toString
  def foo: String = foo()
}

object Little extends Bunny

object Test {
  Little.foo // no error
}
```
It's worth clarifying that this is not an application, so the last paragraph of the section pertains.

In an application, the alternative with default args is eliminated in favor of one without.
There is a monastery high in the Alps where they do nothing but meditate on 6.26.3 from sunrise to sunset.  Then, after a couple of monastic brews, they code until dawn.

A steep path accessible only by goat leads to an iron gate bearing the inscription, La surcharge c'est mal.
Resolution needs a policy.  Another example is #7188.

Maybe it's easy to scan for a PR comment, or conversely for a PR with the SI.

If Jira can be configured with other resolutions, some alternatives besides "not a bug" might be:

"I got my Jira fix for today."
"It bugged **me**."
"Unbroken."
"What is wrong with us?"
"@paulp has a branch for that."
"Think twice before you permute."

or really anything off one of the Scala t-shirts.
