It should be possible to supply a flag to fail fast on both zip and sequence operations.

val a = Future{Thread.sleep(5000);1}
val b = Future{Thread.sleep(1000); throw new Exception("test")}
val c = a zip b

c will fail in 5 seconds with the exception from B.

Most clients would probably prefer it to fail in 1 second even if that means that they might get an exception from Future b instead of a possible exception from Future a.
@phaller WDYT?
