Isn't this not a regression but a progression of SI-4950?

Yep, looks like the same wrinkle.

Here's another case:
scala>   val HOUR = 12; val MINUTE, SECOND = 0;
HOUR: Int = 12
MINUTE: Int = 0
SECOND: Int = 0

scala> var (HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND) = (12, 0, 0)
<console>:5: error: value x$1 is not a member of object $iw
  lazy val $result = `x$1`
