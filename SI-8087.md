Annotations like `@transient` and `@volatile` are not correctly applied to `private\[this\]` fields inside traits. This can easily lead to incorrect behavior (I was surprised to find my program broke when I changed a `@transient var` in a trait from `private` to `private\[this\]`.)

```scala
trait Foo {
  @transient private[this] var a: String = "" // not transient!!
  @transient private var b: String = ""
  @transient var c: String = ""
  
  @transient private[this] val d: String = "" // not transient!!
  @transient private val e: String = ""
  @transient val f: String = ""

  @volatile private[this] var x: String = ""  // not volatile!! 
  @volatile private var y: String = ""
  @volatile var z: String = ""
}

class Bar extends Foo
```
If the fix is non-trivial, it would at least be nice to have a warning that your annotation will get ignored in such cases with the suggestion to change the field from `private\[this\]` to `private`.
See also #7954, in which the @strictfp annotations is dropped on the floor as code is moved around in our encoding of traits and value classes.
What makes this extra fun, is that the workaround of replacing `private\[this\]` with `private` may not do any good. This is because sbt won't necessarily recompile classes implementing the trait because it doesn't think the public interface of the trait has changed.

*So be sure and do a clean compile if you apply this workaround.*
