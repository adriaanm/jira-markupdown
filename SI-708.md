We should migrate Either, Left, and Right to scalax until they are more mature. 
It already exists in Scalaz (scalaz.Either) and will go away in 2.7.1 (but some specialised functions that do not appear in scala.Either will remain), however, it is already very much mature. Ticket #660 came about because it is more inline with existing Scala libraries and ticket #658 is  an enhancement that has a nil side-effect on what already exists (the beauty of purity). Either comes with over 30,000 unit tests and 100% coverage. I'd argue it is the most mature library in the Scala API.

I'm not sure what more could be asked for. Can you elaborate on what you mean by maturity? If so, I'll make it happen.
