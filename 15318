I tried to migrate lib.web from 2.8.0.RC1 to RC2 and got strange compiler errors. Please see attached console log.

The first [ERROR] is this: exception when typing final class Servlet extends javax.servlet.http.!HttpServlet with java.lang.Object with !ScalaObject {scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$!TypeError: class Object needs to be a trait to be mixed in

But my class Servlet is defined as this:
{code}
final class Servlet extends HttpServlet with NotNull {...}
{code}
without any explicit constructors inside.

I'm afraid I'll have to upload the whole project if this log does not provide enough information and you need to reproduce errors.
