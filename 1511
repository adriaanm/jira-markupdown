I don't think this is fixed. Tested with the nightly from this morning. Starting from:
```scala
import java.io._

class Foo {
  
  var map: Map[Int, Int] = _
  
  def bar(list: List[String]) {
    m
  }
}
```

Press ctrl+space with the cursor after m and Map is suggested before Map.

The JDT suggests map before Map with the equivalent Java file.
