It looks like we arrived at approximately the same conclusion.  In r17719 I made a slight modification to isUnrootedExistential which fixes both scala/bug#1896 and scala/bug#715, but it remains to be seen how satisfactory that fix is.  I also would benefit from hearing the thinking behind the logic.  This bug is safely a duplicate of scala/bug#715, so if the issue is to be reopened I vote for doing it there.
