This compiled in 2.9, no longer.
{code}
class CC(xs: List[_ <: AnyRef]) {
  def f(obj: AnyRef, name: String): AnyRef = null
  def g = xs map (x => f(x,""))
}
// t5330.scala:3: error: missing parameter type
//   def g = xs map (x => f(x,""))
//                   ^
{code}
If it's a type parameter bounded by AnyRef, compiles.
Decoupled from the collections dynasty:

{code}
trait FM[A] {
  def map(f: A => Any)
}

trait M[A] extends FM[A] {
  def map(f: A => Any)
}

trait N[A] extends FM[A]

object test {
  def kaboom(xs: M[_]) = xs map (x => ()) // missing parameter type.

  def okay1[A](xs: M[A]) = xs map (x => ())
  def okay2(xs: FM[_]) = xs map (x => ())
  def okay3(xs: N[_]) = xs map (x => ())
}
{code}
Here's a better look at it.
{code}
// compiles
class CC1(xs: List[_]) {
  def f(x1: Any) = null
  def g = xs map (x => f(x))
}
// does not compile
class CC2(xs: List[_]) {
  def f(x1: Any, x2: Any) = null
  def g = xs map (x => f(x, x))
}
{code}
In 2.9, -Xprint:typer for g in CC1 and CC2
{noformat}
def g: List[Null] = CC1.this.xs.map[Null, List[Null]](((x: _$1) => CC1.this.f(x)))(immutable.this.List.canBuildFrom[Null])
def g: List[Null] = CC2.this.xs.map[Null, List[Null]](((x: _$2) => CC2.this.f(x, x)))(immutable.this.List.canBuildFrom[Null])
{noformat}
As similar as one might suppose.  In trunk:
{noformat}
def g: List[Null] = CC1.this.xs.map[Null, List[Null]](((x: Any) => CC1.this.f(x)))(immutable.this.List.canBuildFrom[Null]
def g: <error> = CC2.this.xs.map(((x: <error>) => f(x, x)))
{noformat}
So the existential in the function parameter type has been crushed to Any.
Crossed in the night.

I think this is SI-5399.

In my example:

2.9.2
{code}
        typed xs.map: (f: Any => Any)Unit
        adapted xs.map: (f: Any => Any)Unit to ?, 
        typing ((x) => ()): pt = Any => Any: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=true, silent=true, context.owner=method kaboom
[loaded class file /Users/jason/usr/scala-2.9.1/lib/scala-library.jar(scala/reflect/Code.class) in 2ms]
            typing (): pt = Any: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=true, silent=true, context.owner=value $anonfun
            typed (): Unit
[loaded class file /Users/jason/usr/scala-2.9.1/lib/scala-library.jar(scala/AnyVal.class) in 2ms]
            adapted (): Unit to Any, 
        typed ((x: Any) => ()): Any => Unit
        adapted ((x: Any) => ()): Any => Unit to Any => Any, 
{code}

2.10
{code}
        typed xs.map: (f: _$1 => Any)Unit <and> (f: _$1 => Any)Unit
        adapted xs.map: (f: _$1 => Any)Unit <and> (f: _$1 => Any)Unit to ?, 
        typing ((x) => ()): pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=true, enrichmentEnabled=true, mode=EXPRmode BYVALmode, silent=true, context.owner=method kaboom
            typing (): pt = ?: undetparams=, implicitsEnabled=true, enrichmentEnabled=true, mode=EXPRmode, silent=true, context.owner=value $anonfun
            typed (): Unit
            adapted (): Unit to ?, 
        typed ((x: <error>) => ()): <error> => Unit
        adapted ((x: <error>) => ()): <error> => Unit to ?, 
    no second try: xs.map and ((x: <error>) => ()) because error not in result:
{code}

Disturbingly, {{map}} is treated as an overloaded type.
I'm pretty sure this is to blame.
 https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b7b81ca2

At least this example compiles with that reverted (actually, just with this line https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b7b81ca2#L0L567):

{code}

trait FM[A] {
  def map(f: A => Any)
}

trait M[A] extends FM[A] {
  def map(f: A => Any)
}

object test {
  def kaboom(xs: M[_]) = xs map (x => ()) // missing parameter type.

}
{code}

Without this, {{M#map}} does not match {{FM#map}}, as {{A}} gets a different existential symbol.

{code}
{(f#7469: A#7103 => Any#3533)Unit#1690}.asSeenFrom(xs#8667.type, trait M#9)

tp1 = (f#8670: _$1#8669 => Any#3533)Unit#1690
result = (f#8673: _$1#8671 => Any#3533)Unit#1690
{code}
See also SI-3481, which was fixed by b7b81ca2.
