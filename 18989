According to the announcement of 2.11.0-RC1, I report an issue I have with code that compiles file under 2.10.3 but does not compile under 2.11.0-RC1.

The issue can be reduced to the following minimal case:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_51).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A extends A
class A {
  private var a: Boolean = false 
  def run { A.a = true }
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined module A
defined class A

scala>
```

The same code fails to compile with Scala 2.11.0-RC1
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_51).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A extends A
class A {
  private var a: Boolean = false 
  def run { A.a = true }
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:10: error: value a is not a member of object A
         def run { A.a = true }
                     ^
