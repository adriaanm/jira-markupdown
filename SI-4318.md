=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

If raw bytes are sent to the port for a remote actor, an OutOfMemoryError can occur during deserialization.  For instance, with this remote actor:

{code}
object Echo {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = actor {
    alive(9000)
    register('echo, self)
    loop {
      react {
        case x => println(x)
      }
    }
  }
}
{code} 

I then attempted to send the bytes 't' 'e' 's' 't' '\n' to the actor using a command-line tool, nc:

{code}
echo test | nc localhost 9000
{code}

causing the OutOfMemoryError below.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The deserializer should do some input validation and should fail more gracefully if the remote host does not send a serialized object or sends an object.

=== What do you see instead? ===

The JVM running the actor will report:

{code}
Exception in thread "Thread-10" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
	at scala.actors.remote.Serializer.readBytes(Serializer.scala:27)
	at scala.actors.remote.Serializer.readObject(Serializer.scala:39)
	at scala.actors.remote.TcpServiceWorker.readNode(TcpService.scala:225)
	at scala.actors.remote.TcpService.run(TcpService.scala:146)
{code}

=== Additional information ===

On MacOS, you can use nc to send the bytes to the server.  For operating systems that do not have nc, running "telnet localhost 9000" will also work.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: OS X 10.6.6
