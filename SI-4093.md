Allthough toString is overridden in user class, REPL obviously calls something like Iterable.toString:

```scala
class C(val i: Int) { override def toString = "C:" + i }
val c = new C(4) // REPL-output as expected: c: C = C:4

class C(val i: Int) extends Iterable[Int] {
  def iterator = Iterator(i)
  override def toString = "C:" + i }
val c = new C(4) // REPL-output now erronous: c: C = line16(4)
```

I'd expect the same output, that is
c: C = C:4

Thanks for reviewing.
Hi Paul, hi Everybody,

I have checked this issue today with 2.9.0.RC1. First I saw that the defect has been
successfully fixed for "normal cases". Then I tried (jar on http://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-graph/documents)

```scala
:cp Graph-2.9.0.RC1.jar
import collection.Graph, collection.GraphPredef._, collection.GraphEdge._
Graph(2~3) // REPL-output: ... = Graph(3, 2, GraphBase(2, 3))
```

and

```scala
Graph(2~3).toString // REPL-output: ... = Graph(3, 2, 2~3)
```

Clearly, I'd expect the same output from REPL as when calling toString.

So I have the following questions:

1) Does REPL use toString on the instantiated object or not?[[BR]]
2) If not, in which cases doesn't it?[[BR]]
3) Why appears the prefix "GraphBase" which is the name of a super trait of the instance?[[BR]]
4) Is the above behavoir by design?[[BR]]
5) Is it necessary to narrow down my case?[[BR]]
6) Do you have some suggestions on how to alter the code to be "compatible" with REPL?

It would be a pitty for future users of `collection.Graph` if they could not see the correct output in REPL.

Many thanks, Peter

Well, that jar puts itself in the scala package.  If you're going to put yourself in the scala package, but not actually be part of the scala distribution, it's kind of on you to understand how things fit together.

The answer to the first five of your questions is scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.stringOf.  The answer to the 6th is that bit about the scala package.
