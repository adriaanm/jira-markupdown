The output dir of compilation is not created if it doesn't exists.
In fact it is created only if it is directly under the root of the project (like /bin), but it's not created if it's a sub/sub/.../directory. In this case the root directory is used as output directory.
The cause is IFolder.create throws an exception if its parents doesn't exists.
I attach a patch to fix the defect. I'm not it's the right patch. I also force the creation of the directories on the FS (sometimes required from my test).

This feature is important for maven user, because the default output is /target/classes and /target is remove when maven clean a project.
I'm not able to reproduce the problem. Could you let me know the version of the plugin and Eclipse that you're reporting this against.

For the plugin the SVN revision is what I really need. See [http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/EclipsePlugin here] for details on how to find it.

In fact it was reproduceable so long as the JavaBuilder wasn't configured for the project: by the time the code David's patch touched was reached the JavaBuilder had already created the output directory hierachy.
