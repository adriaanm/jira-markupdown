I appreciate the effort you've taken to open this ticket, but I'm going to close it as invalid.

Trunk is the unstable development branch of the IDE, compiler and libraries. As such, you shouldn't have any expectation of an arbitrary nightly build functioning correctly or even at all.

All of the semantically driven features of the IDE are the subject of major changes at the moment, and hyperlinking/open definition in particular is in the process of being completely reworked. Come back in a few days and watch for announcements on scala-tools@listes.epfl.ch.
