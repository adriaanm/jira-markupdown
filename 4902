The bug seems to be in Nil actually:
```scala
  // Removal of equals method here might lead to an infinite recursion similar to IntMap.equals.
  override def equals(that: Any) = that match {
    case that1: Seq[_] => that1.isEmpty
    case _ => false
  }
```

That is collection.immutable.Seq in the case and I believe it should be collection.Seq.
