=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
scala> 0.0 to 1.0 by 0.25
res0: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Double] = NumericRange(0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)

scala> 0.0 to 1.0 by 1.0 / 3.0
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Non-terminating decimal expansion; no exact representable decimal result.
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

I would prefer to get something "as close as can be achieved" with floating point.

It feels like Range, as well as a "by" method, could also do with a "steps" method or similar, e.g.

0.0 to 1.0 steps 3

which would avoid errors accumulating over several steps.

=== What do you see instead? ===

java.lang.ArithmeticException: Non-terminating decimal expansion; no exact representable decimal result.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: 1.6.0_22-b04-307-10M3261
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.6 (10J567)
(In r24547) My early attempts to implement non-integral ranges in a way which
was useful without having lots of floating point traps were less
than successful.  One of the bigger backfires is that the requirement
not to round (trying, and failing anyway, to avoid surprises with
methods like "contains") inflicts runtime errors.

The simple way to improve this, which seems a good idea anyway,
is to make the default math context something less inclined to
exceptions.  Default BigDecimal mc is now DECIMAL128.
References SI-1812, SI-4201 and puts SI-4201 back to normal priority.

It doesn't sidestep the issue, and it involves new code which I have learned from hard experience is nowhere near as trivial as it appears.  I am in favor of the steps idea (it's most of why the ticket is still open) I just can't do it right now.

This seems to work in 2.10.0.r25445-b20110805020350:

{code}
scala>  0.0 to 1.0 by 1.0 / 3.0
res0: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Double] = NumericRange(0.0, 0.3333333333333333, 0.6666666666666666, 1.0)
{code}
