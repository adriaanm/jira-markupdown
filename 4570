(In r22766) Overhaul of ScalaRunTime.stringOf.  Simplified the logic, but the
material changes are a) deferring to the target object's toString method
on custom collections, so now only built-in collections receive special
treatment, and b) guarding against runaways and inappropriate
exceptions, falling back on toString.  Closes SI-3710, Review by prokopec.
