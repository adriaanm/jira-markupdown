Also, the command syntax for sbt and repl is not uniform, so that I'm in the habit of using ctl-D always.

Unfortunately, that's one or two ctl-D's depending on if you ran sbt console or just console at the sbt prompt.  Sometimes I lose a terminal window.

The other workaround is to start your repl with an exit function predefined.  In fact, I just added it to my init.script.

Oops, actually I already had {{import sys.exit}}. It really is nicer to {code}def exit = { Console println "Bye." ; sys.exit } {code}. What a friendly repl.

Now if only repl wouldn't balk when I accidentally :wq instead. Maybe it can do command aliases.
