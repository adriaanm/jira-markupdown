As of r22631, the REPL in quick is broken/misconfigured in some way. For example, try:
```scala
build$$ quick/bin/scala

import scala.xml._
def x(n: Node): Node =
  n match {
    case <d>{_}</d> => <d>abc</d>
    case other => other
  }
```

The result is a pretty exotic crash involving typer errors and exceptions. In the middle appears the following:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: class file needed by ParIterableLike is missing.
reference value forkjoin of package concurrent refers to nonexisting symbol.
        at scala.reflect.generic.UnPickler$$Scan.errorMissingRequirement(UnPickler.scala:754)
        at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$CompileScan.errorMissingRequirement(UnPickler.scala:43)
        at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$CompileScan.errorMissingRequirement(UnPickler.scala:28)
```

In all likelihood, forkjoin is simply missing from a path somewhere.
