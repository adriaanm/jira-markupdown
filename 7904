May I ask why? This seems a pretty obscure bug that wouldn't really be a blocker.

The policy, given limited resources, is to only backport if the interested party either:

 1. does the leg-work to cherry-pick the commit to the 2.9.x branch and checks that the test suite passes, and submits a pull request, or
 2. has a support contract with TypeSafe.

It's also not clear if there will be a 2.9.3 release at all.
