I suggest that "curry" be deprecated and renamed to "curried", and 
the "tuple" class method Paul only added recently be renamed to 
"tupled" (no deprecation needed since it's brand new). 

see proposal and discussion at
http://old.nabble.com/-scala--Tupling---currying-td26668249.html
there was only support, no dissension.
(In r20561) Adjectified some parts of speech as discussed on the mailing
list.  The methods to call on FunctionN are "curried" and
"tupled" with "curry" deprecated and "tuple" gone.  Closes SI-2907.
