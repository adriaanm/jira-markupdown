If you need help fixing this bug, take a look at how the new optimizer ( http://magarciaepfl.github.io/scala/ ) does it, in particular:

https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/44abfdb886363a19126a68f5f0b24037a73569db/src/asm/scala/tools/asm/optimiz/JumpReducer.java

Quoting from its documentation:

{noformat}
/**
 *  Simplifies branches that need not be taken to get to their destination:
 *    (1) conditional jump followed by unconditional jump, both to the same destination.
 *    (2) (conditional or unconditional) jump to a destination that is the next program point anyway.
 *  Details in `branchOverGoto()` and in `jumpToNext()`
