I have no experience with the compiler, if you need any assistance please let me know and I will see if I can give you additional information.

Project was running, changes I have from the last running version are these:


```java
case class PortfolioVersionsRoot(versions: PortfolioVersions, style3dVersions: List[StyleVersion])

case class StyleVersion(key: String, hash: String)
```

added the Style Version case class and the style3dVersion property to the PortfolioVersionsRoot case class 

and


```java
      val styleObjs = s3.listObjects(new ListObjectsRequest(
        AmazonService.bucketName,
        s"global/3dstyles/$mode",
        "",
        "",
        Integer.MAX_VALUE
      ))

      val styleVersions = styleObjs.getObjectSummaries.toList.map { obj =>
        StyleVersion(obj.getKey, obj.getETag)
      }
```

Created this map with the Amazon SDK having

```java
      import scala.collection.JavaConversions._
```

in scope

stacktrace is in the compilebug.txt in the attachments, all on scala 2.11.7
Actually I was wrong, it's this which is used: "com.github.seratch" %% "awscala" % "0.5.+"

also here is the s3 object:


```java
implicit val s3 = S3(config.getString("amazon.key").get, config.getString("amazon.secret").get)(awscala.Region.Ireland)
```

I just played around a little bit, and it doesn't seem to be the java conversion.
Commenting out all of that makes the compiler still fail with only the changes to the case classes.
I also use upickle (which is a macro library to convert case class to json) 

http://lihaoyi.github.io/upickle-pprint/upickle/
with this version: "com.lihaoyi" %% "upickle" % "0.3.6"
