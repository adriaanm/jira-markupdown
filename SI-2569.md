**scalac 2.8.0** complier doesn't allow a Scala method with a `String*` argument to override a Java method with a `String...` argument. 

`Parent.java`
```scala
  package varargs;
  
  public class Parent {
  
      public String concatenate(String... strings) {
          StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
          for (String s : strings) {
              builder.append(s);
          }
          return builder.toString();
      }
  
  }
```

`Child.scala`
```scala
  package varargs
  
  class Child extends Parent {
  
    override def concatenate(strings: String*): String =
      strings map("\"" + _ + "\"") mkString("(", ", ", ")")
  
  }

```

The above code raises an error with `scalac`: "*method concatenate overrides nothing.*" However this code compiles fine when using Scala 2.7.7.

I'm using a nightly build: **Scala 2.8.0.r19367-b20091102023355**
Replying to [comment:1 SethTisue]:
> dupe of SI-1342? (though that ticket says it was fixed in r19320 and you're using r19367)



Thanks for your quick response. I just realized this is a duplicate of #1342. **However**, #1342 doesn't seem to be fixed on the latest nightly build r19367. So, if you make this (#2569) a duplicate of #1342 and **reopen #1342**, that would be great. 

Here is a full log of compile attempts:

          StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
          for (String s : strings) {
              builder.append(s);
          }
          return builder.toString();
      }

  }

      String concatenate(String... strings);
  
  }

  class ChildImpl extends ParentInterface {
  
    override def concatenate(strings: String*): String =
      strings map("\"" + _ + "\"") mkString("(", ", ", ")")
  
  }
```
It looks to me like it works fine with pure interfaces (notice the test case checked in r19320 still works) and indeed I have no problem extending ParentInterface:
```scala
scala> new ParentInterface { def concatenate(strings: String*): String = null }
res2: java.lang.Object with ParentInterface{def concatenate(strings: String*): String} = $$anon$$1@788c1852
```
But overriding a concrete method, not so successful.
