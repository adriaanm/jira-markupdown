Reflection might be an experimental system but the system that was deemed production ready and which we built production systems on was removed in favor of the experimental API.  (I get that it was thought to be stable and the current problems were something of an "oops".)  TypeTags as a context bounds are the thing holding my team back from 2.10.  I'd **really** like to get the benefits of 2.10 so looking forward to the August update.
