There's nothing "political" about it, and I wouldn't call it a discussion.

What do you even mean, "political"?????

This bug is three months old, I've spent 2 weeks trying to draw attention to it and find out about it's status.

If it breaks my workspace, it breaks a lot of other people's too.

It's not a pet peeve. If it were a clumsy interface or a method with a fence post error that would qualify as a pet peeve.

Breaking a users workspace because of generating invalid class files is another matter entirely.

So far the only response I've gotten back is has been obfuscation and no clear answers.  

It's been fixed, in HEAD. Nobody knows how, nobody knows when, some people think it was fixed in patch SI-4067, extempore says no. No elaboration. Just no, and forget about it.

So how about some answers rather than just shooting the messenger?
