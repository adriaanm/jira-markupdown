This is an old bug that I tracked but didn't open an issue for since I thought that it might be yet another instance of scala/bug#2443. This is because it applies to top level types and not methods. Recently scala/bug#2443 got fixed (and as a result scala/bug#2581 and scala/bug#1584 also got fixed) so I tested this bug again and opened this issue since it is still valid.
