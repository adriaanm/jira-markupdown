This is an old bug that I tracked but didn't open an issue for since I thought that it might be yet another instance of SI-2443. This is because it applies to top level types and not methods. Recently SI-2443 got fixed (and as a result SI-2581 and SI-1584 also got fixed) so I tested this bug again and opened this issue since it is still valid.
