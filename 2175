@nuttycom I'd prefer Scala code to look like this...
```scala
  class MyComponent {
    @Autowired var service = _
  }
```

i.e. that scala code can use the various IoC annotations (as well as JPA annotations and countless others from the Java world) natively without having to create nested annotation wrappers for everything and use the nested annotations instead.

i.e. the compiler plugin decides how certain annotations get copied to field/getter/setter methods at bytecode generation - rather than the user having to use explicit nested annotations at the call site.
