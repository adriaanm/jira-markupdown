Code to reproduce the leak:

import scala.actors.Actor._

object Test {

  val rt = Runtime.getRuntime()

  val sender = actor {
    while(true) {
      receiver ! new Array[Int] (1048576)
      System.gc()
      println ("Used Mem: " + (((rt.totalMemory() - rt.freeMemory()) / 1048576.) formatted "%.2f") + " Mb")
    }
  }

  val receiver = actor {
    loop {
      react {
        case x: Array[Int] => println ("received ["+x.length+"]")
      }
    }
  }

  def main (args: Array[String]) {
    sender
  }

}

I does not leak with receive instead of react.
It happens only when sending from another Actor, as was mentioned on mailing list.

Does not leak commenting FJTaskRunner stuff in scala.actors.Scheduler.execute and leaving only
sched execute { fun }

Calling FJTaskRunner.put instead of .push reduces leak gradually but it's still there.
Same happens when calling take() instead of get() in FJTaskRunner.confirmTake, but there is comment why it should not be done.

Anyway, direct calling FJTaskRunner.push from Scheduler.execute seems like a hack, since it is declared "/*protected*/ public" - it seems it was originally protected and was not supposed to be called from outside.

I can't figure out why is still leaks even with FJTaskRunner.take instead of get, but anyway I see this as potential problem, since VolatileTaskRef is only cleaned in checkOverflow() method which is very rarely called, if ever.

I think the safe way is to leave FJTaskRunner.push as protected, never call it, use only "sched execute { fun }", but I am not sure.
