When using {{Map.filterKeys}}, the given predicate has to be a total function, instead of a function defined only on the keys. Otherwise {{get}} will fail.

This might be unexpected.

 Current code in {{collection.MapLike.scala/FilteredKeys}} (line ~ 234):

{code}
    override def contains(key: A) = self.contains(key) && p(key)
    def get(key: A) = if (!p(key)) None else self.get(key)
{code}

Note how {{contains}} first checks containment inside the map, and thus queries the predicate only for contained elements, thus preventing the unexpected behaviour.

But {{get}} does not perform this check.

So decide upon the following:
- either demand a total function as predicate in the documentation (and change {{contains}})
- or go with predicates that are only defined on the elements of the map and change {{get}}.

I do not think this is a bug. I see nothing that supports the assumption that a partial function would be acceptable as an argument to {{filterKeys}}. This is not even a matter of documentation, just compare the signature
{code:scala}
def filterKeys(p: (A) => Boolean): Map[A, B]
{code}
to that of a method actually allowing a partial function, such as {{collect}}:
{code:scala}
def collect[B](pf: PartialFunction[A, B]): Map[B]
{code}

Regardless of this, the inconsistency between {{get}} and {{contains}} is somewhat ugly. Personally, I'd prefer to have {{contains}} first apply the predicate, because a non-materialized view only makes sense if the predicate is rather lightweight anyway.
I think I would simply change `get` to

{code}
    def get(key: A) = {
      val x = self.get(key)
      if(x.isDefined && p(key)) x else None
    }
{code}

This is about as efficient as before, but does not fail with predicates defined only on the contents of the map.
[~ichoran]: As you say, it is reasonable to assume the predicate test to be simpler/faster than the map lookup. Doesn't that imply nonetheless that the operands of the short-circuited {{&&}} in {{contains}} *should* be swapped? Note that this would, as a side effect, also fix the inconsistency that {{contains\(x)}} does not fail when {{get\(x)}} does, if the filter predicate is undefined for {{x}} (they will then both fail, which is reasonable).
