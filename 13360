ATM, there's no way to annotate anonymous classes:
```scala
trait foo { def xy: Int }

val x = new @serializable @SerialVersionUID(1L) foo { def xy = 2 }
```

Since @SerialVersionUID is the only (official) way to add a static field SerialVersionUID to classes, this should somehow be made possible.

As from the mailing list, this also doesn't work as well:
```scala
val x = new foo @serializable @SerialVersionUID(1L) { def xy = 2 }
```

Any way to achieve this?
