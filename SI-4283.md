Because of erasure, the compiler needs to insert casts to get the expected type. The "expected type" logic seems to depend on the use of the type, rather than the statically-known type.

In this example, since the class `AbstractFoo` is the one that defines the field `t`, the compiler thinks it needs to cast the result of `ScalaBipp.make.get` to `AbstractFoo` in order to access `t`. This is incorrect behavior, since `AbstractFoo` might in fact be inaccessible in the scope in which the cast is applied.

=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
`test/AbstractFoo.java`
{code}
package test;

/* package private */ class AbstractFoo {
  public int t;
}
{code} 
`ScalaBipp.scala`
{code}
package test

class ScalaBipp extends AbstractFoo {
  def make: Option[ScalaBipp] = Option(this)
}
{code}
`test.scala`
{code}
package other

object IllegalAccess {
    val x = (new test.ScalaBipp).make.get.t // java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class test.AbstractFoo from class other.IllegalAccess$$
}
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
No runtime failure.

=== What do you see instead? ===
Runtime exception accessing class `test.AbstractFoo` and the following bytecode:
{code}
javap -c other.IllegalAccess$$

   0:	new	SI-16; //class test/ScalaBipp
   3:	dup
   4:	invokespecial	SI-18; //Method test/ScalaBipp."<init>":()V
   7:	invokevirtual	SI-22; //Method test/ScalaBipp.make:()Lscala/Option;
   10:	invokevirtual	SI-28; //Method scala/Option.get:()Ljava/lang/Object;
   13:	checkcast	SI-30; //class test/AbstractFoo
   16:	getfield	SI-34; //Field test/AbstractFoo.t:I
   19:	istore_2
   20:	return


{code}













=== Additional information ===
The checkcast on line 13 is wrong. It should cast to `ScalaBipp` rather than `AbstractFoo`. 

test

=== Scala version ===
trunk r24156

Still some free riders in the test case not pulling their bug weight.  This is all you need.
{code}
// Ab.java
package test;

class Aa { public int t; }
public class Ab extends Aa { }

// a.scala
object Test extends App { (new test.Ab).t }
{code}
This will be very hard to get right. The info is no longer available at the point where it is needed. All type info is are deleted and then things are re-typechecked from the ground up with casts inserted. There's no room here for "what was the type before?".

(In r24751) Closes SI-4283. no review.
(In r24758) Revert "Closes SI-4283. no review." because of failing tests.
(In https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/8707c9ecb3) This time, fixed SI-4283. no review.
Note that r24749 caused SI-5162.
this one still fails for field writes (2.12.0-M4):

A.java
{code}
package a;
/*package private*/ abstract class A { public int t; }
{code}
B.java
{code}
package a;
public class B extends A { }
{code}
Test.scala
{code}
package b
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val b = new a.B
    b.t = 10
  }
}
{code}

{noformat}
$ javac A.java B.java -d .
$ scalac12 Test.scala
$ scala12 b.Test
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class a.A from class b.Test$
{noformat}

I'll push a fix.
