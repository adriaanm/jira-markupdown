Current string-interpolation based syntax has serious usability problems wrt nesting:
{code}
(stat: Tree, i: Int) => 
  q"""println(s"executing $${${stat.toString}}"); $stat"""
{code}
1. Any use of nested interpolators requires """ quotations even for small snippets
2. Unquoting into another interpolator requires lots of $$$$$$$ and { { { } } } that can be quite hard to read
3. Impossible to express nesting that is more than one level deep

I'm not sure if it's possible to fix those issues in string interpolation itself as it was not really designed for this purpose.
I've been playing with an idea to have something like: {{`...'}} to mean {{q"""..."""}}:

{code}
(stats: Tree, i: Int) => `println(s"executing $${stat.toString}"); $stat'
{code}

Where
{code} 
$$foo
{code}
means unquote two levels deep, not escape dollar within string interpolation. Number of dollars is the same as how many levels deep you are, not {{â‰ˆlevelsdeep^2}} as it is now.  

It also works nicely if you want to write quasiquotes that produce other quasiquotes without any need for escaping whatsoever:
{code}
val valfx = `val fx = f(`x')'
{code}

Of course this is just surface syntax idea, the underlying desugaring stays the same. 
Another possible direction to purse is possibility of unification of scala symbols (as in {{'foo}}) with quasiquotes. So that {{'foo}} means the same as {{q"foo"}} and it's possible to write more complex expression inside quoted parens/braces like {{'(...)}}. Due to asymmetric begin/end of the quotation it will also not incur any tax on nesting.
