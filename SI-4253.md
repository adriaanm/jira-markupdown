  }
}
{code} 

"indirect message from act" never arrives

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

"indirect message from act" should arrive

=== Additional information ===
information about the success of RemoteActors.connect would be great.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.4 LTS 64 bit
Can you post a small reproducible piece of code that causes the bug you are describing? If this is causing the problem:

{code}
 testactor ! "indirect message from act"
{code}

then all the subsequent code is making it harder for the bugfixer to understand what the issue is.

this is the smallest version of the code, but the class MyActor from above is still necessairy.
{code}
object Server extends Actor {
  import scala.actors.remote.{Node,RemoteActor,FreshNameCreator}
  def act{
    loop{
      react{
        case "connect" =>
          val s = FreshNameCreator.newName
          val newactor = new MyActor
          
          // register this actor as remote accessable actor
          RemoteActor.register(s, newactor )         
          
          // now we want to test weather the connection can be made       
          val testactor = RemoteActor.select(Node("localhost",9999), s )
          
          // but this message never arrives the actor
          testactor ! "message from act"
      }
    }
  }
  
  def main(args:Array[String]){
    start
    
    //RemoteActor.classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader()
    RemoteActor.alive(9999)
    RemoteActor.register('server, this )

    this ! "connect"
  }
}
{code}

the expectet output is "message from act" but there is no output
