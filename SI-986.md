```scala
object Unicode extends Application {
	println("Hello ∑�\u03bb∂.")
}
```

When run, I would expect this:
```scala
Hello ∑�λ∂.
```

But I get this:
```scala
Hello ?.
```

Looking at a hex dump of the generated .exe, the string in the executable is literally "Hello ?." (i.e., that really is a question-mark).

Note that I can successfully use “⇒” instead of “=>” in ‘case’ expressions, so Unicode is being successfully parsed at some level.

If I try compiling with option "-encoding UTF8", the results are identical.
With the closure of #6772, this goes out of scope.
