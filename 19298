A private constructor of case class is only accessible in the class/companion object definition. Trying to access from anywhere else results a compilation error.

{code:scala|title=CodeInBody.scala}
object CodeInBody {
  case class A private (i: Int)
  val a1 = A(1)    // compilation error
}
```scala

Except if the case class is defined in a method body.

{code:scala|title=CodeInMethod.scala}
object CodeInMethod {
  def f {
    case class A private (i: Int)
    val a1 = A(1)   // no compilation error
  }
}
```

I would expect the same behavior in both cases.
