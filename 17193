The documentation on ScalaDoc for `TaskSupport` is not adequate. Worse, the `tasksupport` getter/setter is not documented at all.

On the other hand, the four lines example on the Parallel Collection Guide answered most of my questions.

Let's update the API docs, and not be shy about reproducing material from the guide.
