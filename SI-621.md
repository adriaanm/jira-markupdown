The following code compiles and runs as expected:
{code}
    val x : List[T] forSome { type T } = List(42)
    val w = x match { case y : List[u] => ((z : u) => z)(y.head) }
{code}
but this slight variation does not:
{code}
    val x : T forSome { type T } = 42
    val w = x match { case y : u => ((z : u) => z)(y) }
{code}
It reports that it cannot find type {{u}}.  You get the same error with this variation:
{code}
    val x : List[List[T]] forSome { type T } = List(List(42))
    val w = x match { case y : List[List[u]] => ((z : u) => z)(y.head.head) }
{code}
But in this case, I can imagine that the problem can be attributed to erasure.
The first code snippet fails with both 2.7.2 and trunk.
The second code snippet works with both 2.7.2 and trunk.
