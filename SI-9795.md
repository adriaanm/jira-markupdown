Following code looks perfectly fine, but scalac 2.11.8 generates an error message.

Code:
```Scala
case class A(v: Int)
class B(v: Int) extends A(v)

object Test {
  val a = new B(1)
  a match { case A(_) => 1 }
}
```

Error:
```Scala
error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : A
 required: B
  a match { case A(_) => 1 }
                 ^
one error found
```

However, if we annotate `a` with `val a:A = new B(1)`, everything is fine.
That's because you're a non-conformist.

For fun,
```scala
scala> (new A("hi") { }) match { case A(s) => s }
<console>:14: error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : A(in object $iw)
 required: A(in object $iw)
       (new A("hi") { }) match { case A(s) => s }
                                      ^

```
