Even a page with just the basics would be really valuable, IMO.

Over time it would be nice if it eventually reached completeness, but it doesn't need to start there. A first version could end with a bullet list of things which exist but are not doc'ed (that, it seems like we could fairly easy get complete or nearly complete) and an invitation for further pull requests.
