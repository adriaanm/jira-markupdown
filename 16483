Consider this code, defining a simple class with a method named `**`:
```scala
class Foo() {
  def **(s: String) = "Foo"
}
```

Now we add a new classes and correspondent implicits to "add more supported types" to `Foo`s `**` method:
```scala
class Weird(foo: Foo) {
  def **[M](w: Weird) = new Weird(foo)
}

implicit def foo2weird(foo: Foo) = new Weird(foo)
```
```scala
class Weirder[T](foo: T) {
  def **[M](w: Weirder[T]) = new Weirder(foo)
}

implicit def foo2weirder(foo: Foo) = new Weirder(foo)
```
```scala
class Weirdest[T](foo: T) {
  def **(w: Weirdest[T]) = new Weirdest(foo)
}

implicit def foo2weirdest(foo: Foo) = new Weirdest(foo)
```

While the first and the last work, the second one fails:
```scala
// Works:
foo ** new Weird(new Foo)
```
```scala
// Fails:
foo ** new Weirder(new Foo)
/*
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Weirder[Foo]
 required: String
              f ** new Weirder(new Foo)
                   ^
*/
```
```scala
// Works again:
foo ** new Weirdest(new Foo)
```

The only difference between the second and the third example is the removal of the (unused) type parameter `M`.

It looks like as if the implicit method didn't even get considered when it had the type parameter.

I already tried to read the spec to figure out if this is as expected or if this is a bug, but especially in 6.26.3 I haven't understood it fully.

I hope this can be fixed, because this behavior precludes any possibility of working with numbers where one of arguments is a parametrized type.

So while `5 * BigInt(5)` will work, things like `5 * Complex[Long](...)` (math), `5 * Currency[â‚¬](...)` (money), 5 * Quantity[Mass](...)` will not be possible.
