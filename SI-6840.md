```scala
val q"class $name extends Liftable { ..$body }" = tree
val newdefs = body collect { ... }
q"class $name extends AnyRef { ..${body ++ newdefs} }"
```

In this snippet above, body ++ newdefs doesn't work unless adorned in a toList.
The problem is that typechecking with `Any` as expected type (declared type of the argument of the quasiquote) causes `body ++ newdefs` to be typechecked as `Any`.

This seems to be related to #6155.
