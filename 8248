Any updates on this? (or a possible/recommended workaround)

For the interested reader: I encountered this issue with trying to use 'recursive existential types' to call the following Java method (Titan Graph database v0.5.0):
{code:java}
public TitanGraphQuery<? extends TitanGraphQuery> query();
{code}
with TitanGraphQuery being
{code:java}
public interface TitanGraphQuery<Q extends TitanGraphQuery<Q>> {
    public Q has(String key, Object value);
}
{code}

Example Scala code (without explicit types):
{code:scala}
val attrs: Map[String, Any]
val attrQ = attrs.foldLeft(g.query())({
  case (q, (name, value)) => q.has(name, value)
})
{code}

Does this bug mean I cannot use this method in Scala?
