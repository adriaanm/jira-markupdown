scala> var s:String = null;
s: String = null
scala> s.+(s)
res3: java.lang.String = nullnull
scala> s.length
java.lang.NullPointerException

According to the language Spec, ï¿½12.3.1, + is a binary operator, and in Scala operators are just methods with an argument, i.e. 
    s+s is sugar for s.+(s) 

If s above is the Null Pointer, s.+(s) should throw an NPE,
whereas if it is a String, s.length should **not** throw NPE.

The issue has been discussed in the scala list under the heading 
"null + null = ??" and the conclusion seems to be that it can't be talked away, but it is a bug in the Spec
