In standard mode, the REPL will infer a semicolon when you press enter, unless you are in a syntactic spot where a `(` or `{` is unbalanced.

We have to do this to be able to interpret `if (cond) action` is a complete expression by itself (the compiler infers a `else ()`) .

To disable this beheviour, you can enter paste mode.

{code}
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

def foo =
  if (true) 1
  else 0

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

foo: Int
{code}
