Based on the stack trace when the compiler crashes, I think I've stumbled across this same bug again, twice in a fortnight (on different projects). Common factor: me.

Here's a different, more complex (but still not easy to reduce much further) test case:
```scala
object Test {
  trait Foo {
    type Inner
    type Result = Ordering[Inner] // any invariant type constructor
    def get: Result
  }  

  trait Super
  trait Bar[T] extends Super { type Result = T }

  def wrap[V <: Super](v: V): Foo { type Inner = this.type with v.type } = ???
  
  val baz: Bar[_] = ???
  wrap(baz).get: Ordering[Foo { type Result = this.type }]
}
```

This version **does** appear to crash every version of the compiler between 2.10.3 and 2.12.0-M1.
