It would be nice if pattern matches on type worked inside for comprehensions:

{code}
scala> for (Some(x) <- List(None, Some(1))) yield x
res4: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> for (x : Some[_] <- List(None, Some(1))) yield x
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Some[_]) => Some[Any]
 required: (Option[Int]) => ?
       for (x : Some[_] <- List(None, Some(1))) yield x
            ^
scala> Some(1) match { case x : Some[_] => x }
res7: Some[Any] = Some(1)
{code}

I'd like the middle one to be a pattern match on type, so instead of a type error it would give List(Some(1)).
See also SI-1089 and SI-1673, which are basically duplicates of this ticket but might add a little flavor.
Note that this is in a sense the opposite of SI-140. 
To me, this is an exception to the rule, which is something that really doesn't fit Scala. However it works implementation-wise, I'm guided by a simple rule:

Pattern match works on val assignments, for-comprehensions and case statements.

Only there's an exception on for-comprehensions. Worse still, not an exception of an edge case no one is likely to use, or which would be hard to read, but an exception preventing an useful behavior. Right now, one can't express something like "for all ints in this list" in a direct way.

I've been using this workaround:

{code}
scala> val xs = Seq(Some(1), None)             
xs: Seq[Option[Int]] = List(Some(1), None)

scala> for { x @ (_x : Some[_]) <- xs } yield x
res0: Seq[Some[Any]] = List(Some(1))
{code}

Unfortunately `_` can't be used in place of `x` or `_x`.
@retronym's workaround is good for the match forms in SI-1089 and SI-1673 too, ie. the following compiles and evaluates as expected,

{code}
scala> val l = List(1, "foo", null)
l: List[Any] = List(1, foo, null)

scala> for (s @ (_x : String) <- l) yield s
res0: List[String] = List(foo)
{code}

I just asked a question related to this on StackOverflow and Daniel pointed to this ticket. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4952124/why-is-there-a-difference-in-behavior-between-these-two-pattern-matches-in-a-for

The current behavior is really confusing and it would be great if it could be fixed.

A perhaps more intention revealing version of the workaround:

{code}
scala> object Typed { def unapply[A](a: A) = Some(a) }
defined module Typed

scala> for { Typed(a: Int) <- List(1, "2") } yield a
res1: List[Int] = List(1)
{code}
