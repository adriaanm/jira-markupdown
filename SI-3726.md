And in consequence, if the block ends with a constant expression the constant type propagates to the whole block, which is afterwards replaced by the constant itself.

See http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/Optimization-gone-awry-or-dumb-programmer-not-understanding-semantics-td2312693.html#a2312693

The problem manifests itself in a case like this:

{code}
def test(f: () => Int) = {
  val x = f()
  5
}
{code}

where the typer replaces the complete function by simply
{code}
def test(f: () => Int) = 5
{code}
Another possible fix would be to remove the case
{code}
    case Apply(fn, List()) =>
      isPureExpr(fn)
{code}

from TreeInfo.isPureExpr completely, though I have no idea what purpose it really serves.
