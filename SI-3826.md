How about a @source in the scaladoc options to display the source code of functions pretty printed? 
It could be displayed in the same place as params

This should be useful for specific libraries
Scaladoc can link to the source code on websites that offer syntax highlighting(like github). Also you can use:
{code}
 /** Code explanation for foo
  *  {{{ code }}}
  */
 def foo
{code}
to include significant pieces of code into the descriptions.
