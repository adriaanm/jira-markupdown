I have no experience with the compiler, if you need any assistance please let me know and I will see if I can give you additional information.

Project was running, changes I have from the last running version are these:


{code:java}
case class PortfolioVersionsRoot(versions: PortfolioVersions, style3dVersions: List[StyleVersion])

case class StyleVersion(key: String, hash: String)
{code}

added the Style Version case class and the style3dVersion property to the PortfolioVersionsRoot case class 

and


{code:java}
      val styleObjs = s3.listObjects(new ListObjectsRequest(
        AmazonService.bucketName,
        s"global/3dstyles/$mode",
        "",
        "",
        Integer.MAX_VALUE
      ))

      val styleVersions = styleObjs.getObjectSummaries.toList.map { obj =>
        StyleVersion(obj.getKey, obj.getETag)
      }
{code}

Created this map with the Amazon SDK having

{code:java}
      import scala.collection.JavaConversions._
{code}

in scope

stacktrace is in the compilebug.txt in the attachments, all on scala 2.11.7
