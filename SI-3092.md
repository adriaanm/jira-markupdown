That's a nice vague summary! It's OK though because I'm assigning it to myself.  My motivation of the moment is as described in an email quoted below, but I have others in mind, and hopefully people can remind me of their least favorites in the comments.
{code}
I have a method that takes a List[A] as a parameter, where A was unbounded,
and was matching on the list and calling .getClass on its head.  It's pretty
clear in retrospect that this won't work, since A is effectively Any, and
.getClass is only applicable to AnyRef, but the resulting error message
could use some work:

I would not label this as my least favorite, but since it came up, but I will at least record it here.

Compiling this code:
{code}
object T {
  var X = 3
  val y =
    5 match {
      case X => true
      case _ => false
    }
}
{code}

gives the error message:

{code}
A.scala:5: not found: value X
      case X => true
           ^
{code}

An improvement might be "X is not a stable identifier" or similar.
Reminder to self, heard on IRC:
{code}
I'm trying to use the keySet method on a Map but get this error: not enough arguments for method apply: (elem: com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key)Boolean in trait SetLike. Unspecified value parameter elem.
{code}
{code}
class Test {
  def foo {
    private def bar {}
  }
}
{code}
produces [[BR]]
_error: illegal start of statement[[BR]]
private def bar {}_

I'm unsure what would be better message, but the point is that the private modifier in this context is useless, because I'm already nested in a block. I find the current message puzzling, as I don't see a __statement__ here.
Note to self: see if you can warn people who say
{code}
CollectionType[_] <: java.util.Collection[_]
{code}
when what they mean is
{code}
CollectionType[X] <: java.util.Collection[X] 
{code}
Note to self: people are constantly expressing confusion at error messages like this:
{code}
found  : Int
required: String
{code}
...understandably enough, because they just happen to be doing something with '+' and the compiler unhelpfully interprets their efforts as something involving any2stringadd.  Boy I'd sure like to turn that light off someday.
Note to self: Zaugg says, with respect to type inference on partial function literals:
{code}
Let's just agree that you'd be considered a light-year more awesome if
you could train the compiler to say "Please see ï¿½8.5 of the Scala
Reference" rather than the blather about x0$$1 and expanded functions.
{code}
Clearly this suggestion has priority since it comes with a quantified awesomeness increase.
Don't know if this qualifies as opaque enough, and I also don't know if there is something you can do about it. Anyway, sometimes I forget the "def" when writing an auxiliary constructor:

{code}
// Eg.scala
class Eg(name: String) {
 this() = this("DEFAULT")
}

$$ scalac Eg.scala 
Eg.scala:2: error: value update is not a member of Eg
 this() = this("DEFAULT")
 ^
one error found
{code}

(I now immediately recognise the problem and simply add the missing "def", but the first few times, I found the error message a tiny bit cryptic.)

(In r23210) Positioning fix closes SI-3092, no review.
meant SI-3902
{code}
scala> case class C(a: Any)
defined class C

scala> (new C(())) match {
     |    case C =>
     | }
<console>:9: error: pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
 found   : object C
 required: C
          case C =>
               ^
{code}

Suggested type diagnostics:

"Note: you referred to the companion object of the class C. Perhaps you meant '_ : C' or 'C(_)'
I do understand why this and similar code won't compile (two nodes vs. one), but the compiler message is a bit cryptic, I think.

{code} 
scala> val test = true match { case true => <br/><br/> case false => <br/> }

<console>:7: error: kinds of the type arguments (Seq[Any]) do not conform to the expected
kinds of the type parameters (type CC) in class GenericCompanion.
Seq[Any]'s type parameters do not match type CC's expected parameters: trait Seq has one
type parameter, but type CC has one
       val test = true match { case true => <br/><br/> case false => <br/> }
           ^
{code} 

Ha, I did one better on that last one and just made it work.
{noformat}

I have checked the comments and created a new ticket for each appropriate one. I'll close this as all complaints mentioned here are either fixed, or tracked as individual tickets (SI-4878, SI-4879).

The new metabug tracking most of compiler error message-related issues is SI-4876.
