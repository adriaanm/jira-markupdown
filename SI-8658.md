trait Node { // must be a trait
  def isLeaf: Boolean = ???
}

object MyLeaf extends Node {
  override final val isLeaf = true // must be override final val
  // mixin erroneously generates two methods in the object: forwarder and the actual method
  /** (un-mangled from a repl session)
  object MyLeaf extends Object with Node {
    def isLeaf(): Boolean = Node$class.isLeaf(MyLeaf.this);
    final override <stable> <accessor> def isLeaf(): Boolean(true) = true;

This is a duplicate of SI-8323 / SI-8539. Workaround is to annotate the type of `isLeaf` or mark it non-final so that it isn't treated as a compile time constant.
