The following code runs into a deadlock, even though all monitors are acquired and released correctly. Note that the code runs as expected when using the commented class, and running the object body from a newly created instance of that class.

{code}
class Control {
  var proceed = false
  def cont(): Unit = synchronized {
    println("acquired main lock")
    proceed = true
    println("notifying main thread")
    notify()
  }
  def waitOn(): Unit = synchronized {
    while (!proceed) {
      println("suspending main thread")
      wait()
    }
  }
}

/*
class MainClass {
  def run() {
    val mainControl = new Control

    val r = new Runnable {
      def run() {
        println("running body")
        //body
        println("hello")
        println("acquiring main lock")
        mainControl.cont()
      }
    }
    val worker = new Thread(r)
    worker.start()
    mainControl.waitOn()
  }
}
*/

object threadResume2 extends Application {
  //(new MainClass).run()

  val mainControl = new Control

  val r = new Runnable {
    def run() {
      println("running body")
      //body
      println("hello")
      println("acquiring main lock")
      mainControl.cont()
    }
  }
  val worker = new Thread(r)
  worker.start()
  mainControl.waitOn()
}
{code}
It's a very interesting issue, but I don't think this is a bug. It has to do with class initialization and the way the Java Virtual Machine loads and initializes classes. Scala top-level objects are initialized lazily, on first access, and that means the constructor is invoked in the static initializer of that class. In this example, the constructor is waiting on an object, and suspends. This means the {{threadResume2}} class has not finished initialization, and its thread is waiting... The other thread reaches {{mainControl.cont()}} which in fact has a hidden reference to the top-level (uninitialized) object. The JVM stops execution and waits for the class to be properly initialized before allowing some code to call methods on it. Hence the deadlock.

You can find more information about this in section 12.4.2 of the  [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/execution.html JLS].

Here's a Java program which has the same behavior:
{code}
class Control {
    boolean proceed = false;
    synchronized void cont() {
        System.out.println("acquired main lock");
        proceed = true;
        System.out.println("notifying main thread");
        notify();
    }
    synchronized void waitOn() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!proceed) {
            System.out.println("suspending main thread");
            wait();
        }
    }
}


class Deadlock {
    static Deadlock MODULE = null;

    Control mainControl = new Control();

    Runnable r = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("running body");
                //body
                System.out.println("hello");
                System.out.println("acquiring main lock");
                Deadlock.MODULE.mainControl.cont();
            }
        };

    Deadlock() throws InterruptedException {
        Thread worker = new Thread(r);
        worker.start();
        mainControl.waitOn();
    }

    static {
        try {
            MODULE = new Deadlock();
        } catch(InterruptedException e) {}
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
{code}
