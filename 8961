The extra-variable is actually lightweight, and apparently LambdaLift isn't too late to apply it (I'm guessing here). Perhaps detecting new Foo(try{...}catch{...}) during LambdaLift is also amenable to a local rewriting 
```scala
var temp = try {} catch {}
new Foo(temp)
```

I agree getting this fixed first in a binary-compatible way is the best for now.
