scaladoc doesn't add the automatic white space when backtick escaped text that should render in teletype is placed at the beginning or ending of a line. e.g.
```scala
/**
 * different default value for
 * the `orient` argument!
 */
```

will place correctly add space characters between "for" and "the", "the" and "orient", and "orient" and argument. whereas
```scala
/**
 * different default value for the
 * `orient` argument!
 */
```

will omit the space between "the" and "orient". and
```scala
/**
 * different default value for the `orient`
 * argument!
 */
```

will omit the space between "orient" and "argument".

i think the behaviour should be changed to match the white space
behaviour of non-attributed text.
