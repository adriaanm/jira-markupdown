Fixing this would be a challenge of a magnitude similar to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7046, because both of these issues are about lazy completers. In this particular case we're a bit more lucky, since we could auto-force symbols returned by knownDirectSubclasses, but that might lead to spurious cyclic reference errors, but I would prefer not to do that inside the reflection framework.
