When I try to compile oauth.scalar1 with the command:

```scala
~/Download/scala/scala-2.7.3.r17424/bin/scalac -cp oauth-core-20090408.jar:. oauth.scala
```

I get:

```scala
error: error while loading OAuthClient, class file 'oauth-core-20090408.jar(net/oauth/client/OAuthClient.class)' is broken
(class java.util.Map$$Entry not found.)
one error found
```

The command above was for the latest (r17424) of the 2.7.x branch (soon to be 2.7.4-rc1). I also tried 2.7.3 and r17458 from trunk with the same results.

Note that this requires the oauth-core jar available from:

http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/maven/net/oauth/oauth-core/20090408/oauth-core-20090408.jar

I will try to produce a reduced set of Java files that can cause this behaviour, but wanted to register the problem here in case someone has an idea of what could cause the issue.

It seems like the issue is caused by the the loading order. When the example was a bit larger, removing OAuthMessage from the parameter would cause things to work fine even though the class considered broken was referenced.

r1 oauth.scala
```scala
package test

import net.oauth.OAuthMessage

class OAuthClassBroken {
  def createOAuthAccessor(message: OAuthMessage) = null
}
```

I can confirm that I've run into what seems to be exactly this bug on some of my code.  Indeed it is tricky to reproduce - I currently have a setup where my code compiles ONLY IF I include a seemingly superfluous classOf[] reference before the compiler hits the problematic code block.

So it definitely has to do with the ordering that the compiler loads classes (and in particular, it's only inner classes that are affected).

I've distilled it down to something short: the following snippet works fine:

```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.3.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_12).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> classOf[edu.stanford.nlp.util.ArrayCoreMap]
res0: java.lang.Class[edu.stanford.nlp.util.ArrayCoreMap] = class edu.stanford.nlp.util.ArrayCoreMap

scala> exit
```

But if I load another class first:

```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.3.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_12).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> classOf[edu.stanford.nlp.util.CoreMap]     
res0: java.lang.Class[edu.stanford.nlp.util.CoreMap] = interface edu.stanford.nlp.util.CoreMap

scala> classOf[edu.stanford.nlp.util.ArrayCoreMap]
error: error while loading ArrayCoreMap, class file '/home/dramage/Projects/dev/javanlp/projects/core/classes/edu/stanford/nlp/util/ArrayCoreMap.class' is broken
(class edu.stanford.nlp.util.TypesafeMap$$Key not found.)
```

Sorry I can't share those (Java) files easily.
