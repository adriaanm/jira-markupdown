The SyncVar.get(timeout: Long) documentation for the timeout parameter is incorrect. It says that passing in 0 seconds will cause the timeout to be "forever", but actually it means that the timeout completes immediately.
The associated ticket won an "Excellence in Ticketing" award, and explains that the behavior was intentional.
