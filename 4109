Jenkins claims that my pull request passes all tests:
https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/pr-scala-testsuite-linux-opt/130

However, the number of times the warning triggers (for instance when compiling the standard library) is scary:
https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/pr-scala-testsuite-linux-opt/130/console
After all, the pattern eliciting the problem does not seem to be unusual, and scalac would probably ignore the erased signature and only consider the generic one, hence this amount of warning is not necessarily wrong (also, I did not modify the warning itself, I only enabled it by default).

Moreover, it is somewhat interesting that tests pass, since on my local machine I get errors (_mostly_ OOM) while running the test suite, both with and without my changes (I'm comparing the results).
