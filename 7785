You didn't understand me.  ClassTag is in a parameter type in the method signature of toArray now.  You are trying to override it with a method which takes a ClassManifest parameter instead.  You can no more do this than you can override "def f(x: Traversable[Int])" with "def f(x: List[Int])".  The implicit conversions are of no use.  The parameter types must match.
