When the interpreter catches an exception that wraps another exception (i.e. `getCause` is non-null), the interpreter silently unwraps the exception chain and displays only the innermost exception. Thus the exception displayed is not the one that was caught, and information about outer exceptions is silently discarded.

== To reproduce ==

`Scala code runner version 2.7.2.final -- Copyright 2002-2008, LAMP/EPFL`

Enter the following at the interpreter:

```scala
throw new IllegalArgumentException(new ClassCastException)
```

== Expected behaviour ==
The interpreter prints a stack trace for the *outermost* exception in the chain (`IllegalArgumentException` in the example).

== Actual behaviour ==
The interpreter prints a stack trace for the *innermost* exception (`ClassCastException` in the example), and discards all outer exceptions without notice.
The interpreter is going out of its way to display an exception that isn't the one it actually caught. In doing so, it silently discards potentially valuable debugging information, such as the classes of the outer exceptions, and any messages that might be associated with them. As a more detailed example:

```scala
throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument foo has the wrong type", new ClassCastException)
```

If this example line is entered into the interpreter, the following stack trace is printed:

```scala
java.lang.ClassCastException
	at .<init>(<console>:5)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:3)
	at RequestResult$$.<clinit>(<console>)
	at RequestResult$$result(<console>)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)
	at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.inv...
```

As you can see, the diagnostic message about "argument foo" is completely lost, as is the fact that the exception in question is actually an `IllegalArgumentException` and not a `ClassCastException`. This makes it much more difficult to diagnose the cause of the exception, especially if the user is not expecting the silent unwrapping to take place.

The change I am proposing is simply that instead of printing the inner exception (`orig.printStackTrace(str)`), the outer exception should be printed instead (`e.printStackTrace(str)`), since the information provided by the inner exception(s) will still be included in the outer exception's stack trace.

Since this change only affects the stack trace displayed to the user, I don't anticipate it breaking any other component. I don't know if the interpreter relies on this behaviour for some other internal reason, but if it does it is still incorrect for it to be discarding user-thrown exceptions. I cannot see how the existing behaviour could be considered correct or desirable.
After some poking around I realize that *some* unwrapping is needed, because the user code is being invoked via reflection. If the user code throws an exception, `Method#invoke` will instead report it as an `InvocationTargetException` with the user-caused exception as its cause.

Therefore I propose that the correct implementation is for the interpreter to remove exactly one level of indirection via `getCause`, provided the exception caught is in fact an `InvocationTargetException`.

So the current code is
```scala
  case e =>
    def caus(e: Throwable): Throwable =
      if (e.getCause eq null) e else caus(e.getCause)
    val orig = caus(e)
    (stringFrom(str => orig.printStackTrace(str)), false)
```

but I propose that it should instead be
```scala
  case e =>
    def caus(e: Throwable): Throwable =
      if (e.isInstanceOf[java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException] &&
          e.getCause ne null) e.getCause else e
    val orig = caus(e)
    (stringFrom(str => orig.printStackTrace(str)), false)
```

i.e. unwrap only once, and only if the exception represents an exception thrown by user code.
This ought to be fixed in r17238.  I also had to unroll ExceptionInInitializerErrors because of the way the interpreter works.
```scala
scala> throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument foo has the wrong type", new ClassCastException)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: argument foo has the wrong type
	at .<init>(<console>:5)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
```
