In the repl:

{noformat}
scala> def f() { println("executed") }
f: ()Unit

scala> f
executed
{noformat}

This doesn't just happen in the repl, it happens everywhere, any time f is referenced, eg passed to another function, assigned to a val, etc.  I would have expected that f would only be invoked when using parenthesis, eg {{f()}}, which does work.
