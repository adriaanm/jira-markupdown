Unfortunately I did not find an easy way to reduce it further, or remove the dependency on spray-json.

Compiler currently errs with:

```
$ sbt ';clean;compile'

Take a look at the file: https://github.com/axos88/scala-bug-implicit-ambiguity/blob/master/src/main/scala/example/json/JsonProtocol.scala

The following things fix the error:

1. CHANGING THE ORDER of line 30 and 31 (! wtf?)
2. Removing the T: TypeTag restriction from line 11 (resulting in `def stringFormat[T]`)
3. Removing line 22, or the implicit from Foo's companion class (makes sense).

The fact that #1 fixes it suggests it is a compiler bug, or an undetected undefined behaviour.

Expected Behaviour: 

Compilation should succeed, and fooFormatHighPrio should take precedence over fooFormatLowPrio and FooFormatLowestPrio when one has JsonProtocol._ in scope.

OR

Error with ambigous implicits for JsonFormat[Foo]

Current Behaviour:

Misterious error message about NOT finding an implicit, whereas there are multiple candidates with different priorities.

This is not the duplicate of #8697.

The implicits whose order is changed in the file are NOT related, and have nothing in common with the implicit that is NOT being found.
Basically adding a new line with an implicit value AFTER the questioned file creates an error in the line before.
This is the one where the call to stringFormat in object Foo induces implicit search (augmentString and a TypeTag), which causes the imported symbols to be checked. Conversely to my previous comment,
```scala
import JsonProtocol.{ stringFormat, barFormat, bazFormat } 
```
suffices to break it. barFormat uses stringFormat, baz uses formatter for Foo, Bar.
