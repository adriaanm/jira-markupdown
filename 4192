Hi Lukas.

Looking at other javax.persistence annotations like @Column or @OneToMany, how do you recommend dealing with them ? 

Some examples:
```scala
@Column(name = "TEST_ENTITY_ID", nullable = false)
....
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "testEntity")
```

There is bespoke attribute information required, so this would not seem to fit the type alias strategy.

The Id annotation mod worked, but now I have failing OneToMany's etc.

Thanks for your help,
