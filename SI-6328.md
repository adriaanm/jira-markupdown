The following test case produces a warning, but I do not believe it should:

{code}
scala> object Foo { def eq(x:Int) = x }
defined module Foo

scala> Foo.eq(1)
<console>:9: warning: comparing values of types object Foo and Int using `eq' will always yield false
              Foo.eq(1)
                    ^
res0: Int = 1
{code}


The bug appears to be in RefChecks.scala:

{code}
...
    def checkSensible(pos: Position, fn: Tree, args: List[Tree]) = fn match {
      case Select(qual, name @ (nme.EQ | nme.NE | nme.eq | nme.ne)) if args.length == 1 =>
        def isReferenceOp = name == nme.eq || name == nme.ne

...

        // Whether def equals(other: Any) is overridden                                                                                                                                                                                     
        def isUsingDefaultEquals      = {
          val m = receiver.info.member(nme.equals_)
          (m == Object_equals) || (m == Any_equals)
        }
        // Whether this == or != is one of those defined in Any/AnyRef or an overload from elsewhere.                                                                                                                                       
        def isUsingDefaultScalaOp = {
          val s = fn.symbol
          (s == Object_==) || (s == Object_!=) || (s == Any_==) || (s == Any_!=)
        }
        // Whether the operands+operator represent a warnable combo (assuming anyrefs)                                                                                                                                                      
        def isWarnable           = isReferenceOp || (isUsingDefaultEquals && isUsingDefaultScalaOp)
{code}

note that isReferenceOp is "true" whenever the method name is "eq" or "ne". This code does not take into account whether the method has been overloaded. A check similar to the one used by "isUsingDefaultEquals" and "isUsingDefaultScalaOp" should be included for "eq" and "ne".
More or less a duplicate of SI-6091.

Dealing with name, rather than symbols, is perilous when creating or pattern matching against trees.
