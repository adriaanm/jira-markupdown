No, it's not. They are the same. But, as far as I understand, this issue is closed as it has been concluded that such a message is enough for this wierd typechecking cycle. See other comments, especially those by @retronym: {quote}I'm planning to close this one with that error message in a neg test{quote}.
**Update:**
OK, as Jason pointed out, it's that additional warning (to the compile error) that is swallowed by SBT.
