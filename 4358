I agree strongly on point 1.

Instead throwing an exception why not add a lazy parameter that can be used for holes. Then do overload the function with no parameter list or name the other one transposeWithHoleValue (gets around currying amibuigities) and use `error("Need to provide a value for holes when calling transpose on jagged lists").`

If you go the default parameter route you'd have to call list.transpose() with the parens which is a little annoying.

Then if desired people could do: 
`xs  map(Some(_)) transposeWithHoleValue None`
