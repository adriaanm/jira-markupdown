See related discussion about refinement owners in SI-8177.

;tl;dr: CompoundTypeTrees in the tpts of constructor parameters give rise to refinement class symbols owned by the classes owner. These are copied verbatim into the type of the associated accessor method. Subsequent attempts to `asSeenFrom` from this refinement class fail to substitute type parameters of the enclosing class, as the owner chain of the refinement suggests that is is not in scope. I suspect that similar problems could arise in joint/separate compilation as a result of the behaviour described above.

Reopening so we can re-assess for 2.12
