You can as easily write that as
{code}
  new Traversable[T] { def foreach ... } iterator
{code}
There are also methods like Iterator.iterate and Iterator.continually and more: you never have to define next and hasNext yourself unless you want to.  TraversableOnce is a retrofit to eliminate code duplication between Iterator and Traversable, and except for internal use it's most likely less appropriate than one or the other of those.
