According to the Scala spec, :// is not one of the explicitly disallowed operators.  Example usage:

{code}
val :// = "testing"
{code}

Unfortunately, the parser interprets this as {{val :}} followed by a comment.  The lexer should be made aware of the associated parse context (scannerless) to allow this sort of thing.  At the very least, the spec should be clarified.
I think the spec is reasonably clear that :// is not a valid token.
{code}
Tokens may be separated by whitespace characters and/or comments. Comments come in two forms:
A single-line comment is a sequence of characters which starts with // and extends to the end of the line.
{code}
The only way :// could be valid is if you couldn't separate tokens there (e.g. in the middle of a string literal.) Since : is a valid token, :// is a : and a comment.

But it is true the spec should be clarified.  The above lines are from section 1.4, and section 1.1 says "an identifier can start with an operator character followed by an arbitrary sequence of operator characters" without putting any qualifiers on "arbitrary".  Some kind of "except for" clause would be enough.
