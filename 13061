Attempting to compile the following file:
```scala
package a.b.scala
case class Test[T](t : T)
```

gives this error:
```scala
test.scala:2: error: type Nothing is not a member of package a.b.scala
case class Test[T](t : T)
                ^
one error found
```

Also occurs if the case class is in package a.b and package a.b.scala is defined.

Tested against rev 13855
