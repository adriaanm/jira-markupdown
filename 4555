Akka has been the default actor library since 2.10, and Scala actors are very deprecated, so I think this can safely be closed.

Also, Akka has an incredibly good [documentation|http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala.html] and a good [migration guide|http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/actors-migration-guide.html].
