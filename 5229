The original implementation made me too nervous because it created divergent implicit expansions where there were none before, so you have to import it now: import Ordering.Implicits._.

The general issues of Ordering's variance, and the obstacle that implicit search for contravariant types prefers (or would if Ordering were contravariant) "Ordering[Any]" to "Ordering[SpecificThing]" remain unresolved.
