I noticed this as well when implementing the fix for SI-2943.  I don't use scripts so I figured I was doing something wrong.

Note that if you use -savecompiled, it only hangs when the script needs to be recompiled.  The ctrl+break dump shows threads hanging around that are related to forking a process.  It looks like there are two threads that read from the input stream of a forked process.  I assume that it is something about io.Process that is the problem and that the problem is triggered by forking fsc.

So, I think that r22186 merely exposed an issue in io.Process and r22186 is not necessarily an issue itself.
