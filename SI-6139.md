{code}
class Indirection[T](implicit val c: CompanionProvider[T]) {
  def indirect: c.CompanionT = c.provide
}

// error: value foo is not a member of _1.c.CompanionT
new Indirection[Foo].indirect.foo
{code}

this doesn't work because `new Indirection[Foo]: Indirection[Foo]`,
i.e., there's no information about the implicit value that was inferred for `c` in the type of the target of the selection of `indirect`
An example from the mailing lists:

{code}

sealed trait EntityRef {
  type RefId
}

trait ProductRef extends EntityRef {
  type RefId = Boolean
}

object SomeAction {
  implicit def rootRef2Id[T <: EntityRef](ref: T): ref.RefId = ???
  def handle(c: ProductRef) {
     locally(c: Boolean)
  }
} 

Implicit search approximates the type of `rootRef2Id` as `(?) => ?#RefId`. This happens here in Implicits.scala [1].

I have added this example to SI-6139 [2]. It is unlikely we'll touch this in 2.11, so you might need to pursue a different approach.
