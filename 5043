There's no reason to put classes in package objects: I think we should prohibit it, at least in the short term, since you get weird behaviors like this.

{code}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method boolean2ValSI-9273 in package barSI-9264 of type (bSI-11195: BooleanSI-3807)foo.bar.packageSI-9265.ValSI-9272
 and method boolean2ValSI-9273 in package barSI-9264 of type (bSI-11195: BooleanSI-3807)foo.bar.package.ValSI-9272
 are possible conversion functions from BooleanSI-3807(false) to fooSI-9261.barSI-9263.packageSI-9265.ValSI-9272
{code}
So I guess foo.bar.packageSI-9265.ValSI-9272 != foo.bar.package.ValSI-9272.  Is that the package object vs. the package object class?
