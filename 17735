It would be convenient to be able to access a symbol's flags directly. For example, if we want to implement a trait's methods in a macro, but don't have access to a tree for the trait, we currently have to iterate through the trait type's declarations and manually create Modifiers for each by reconstructing the flags from the method symbol's isPrivate, etc. methods.
