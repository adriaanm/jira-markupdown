I have just committed r17144 and closed SI-1565.  The bug originally reported in this ticket works fine now:
{code}
scala> (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b))
res0: (Int, Int) => Unit = <function>

scala> res0(5, 10)
List(5, 10)
{code}
However lex's specific example is thorny:
{code}
a : Int => println("hello")
{code}
That is, I think the specific case of an unparenthesized one-argument function may be best dealt with by special casing the interpreter, because I'm pretty sure disambiguating it in the parser is impossible.
{code}
// is that a function or a self-type? 
scala> class Foo
scala> class Bar extends Foo { self: Bar => println("hi") }
{code}
I'll look at this some more but I think the lion's share of the available improvement is in the patch for 1565.
