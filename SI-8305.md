package.scala

{code}
package urgh {
  trait One extends Base {
    def one = 1
  }

  trait Two extends Base {
    def two = true
  }

  trait Base {
    trait Two[A, B] {
      def three(a: A, b: B): A = a
    }
  }
}

package object urgh extends One with Two
{code}

{noformat}
$ scalac package.scala
{noformat}

Woo, compilation succeeded. Time to run my awesome program!

{noformat}
$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).

scala> import urgh._
error: error while loading Two, class file './urgh/Two.class' has location not matching its contents: contains trait Two

{noformat}
I should note that the {{Two}} which wins is the first one:

{noformat}
$ javap urgh.Two
Compiled from "package.scala"
public interface urgh.Two extends urgh.Base {
  public abstract boolean two();
}
{noformat}
You can witness the problem (or one of them) a lot more easily like so:
{code}
package urgh { trait One }
package object urgh { trait One }
{code}
Like the reported example, that compiles from source, then fails if classfiles are present.
