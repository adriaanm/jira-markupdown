package.scala

```scala
package urgh {
  trait One extends Base {
    def one = 1
  }

  trait Two extends Base {
    def two = true
  }

  trait Base {
    trait Two[A, B] {
      def three(a: A, b: B): A = a
    }
  }
}

package object urgh extends One with Two
```

```
$ scalac package.scala
```

Woo, compilation succeeded. Time to run my awesome program!

```
$ scala

scala> import urgh._
error: error while loading Two, class file './urgh/Two.class' has location not matching its contents: contains trait Two

scala>
```
I should note that the `Two` which wins is the first one:

```
$ javap urgh.Two
Compiled from "package.scala"
public interface urgh.Two extends urgh.Base {
  public abstract boolean two();
}
```
You can witness the problem (or one of them) a lot more easily like so:
```scala
package urgh { trait One }
package object urgh { trait One }
```
Like the reported example, that compiles from source, then fails if classfiles are present.
