Setting some color for 'string' and then some other attributes (bold/italic) for literals will make strings bold and italic too. It has some logic (strings are literals too), but not very intuitive. 
Probably connected: setting a color for 'class' makes traits and types use the same color. And the sample window has wrong code:

{code}
..
class SomeTrait
class SomeObject
{code}

should be

{code}
..
trait SomeTrait
object SomeObject
{code}

It looks like this is an enhancement request rather than a defect. Are there any specific proposals?
