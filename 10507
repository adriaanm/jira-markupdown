Aggressively dealiasing early in the piece also robs people of their abstractions:

{code}
class C {
  type T = Int
  def foo: T = 0
  def bar = foo
}
{code}

Here, we don't want to expose the Int in inferred the return type of `bar`.

Not saying that the proposed patches actually change that exact sample, but that's another thing we have to take care with.
