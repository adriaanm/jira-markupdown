Here are two little problems with fsc error handling.  First, `scalac -Xshow-phases` does not work--it prints out a help message.  Similarly, `scalac foo.scala -Xshow-phases`, where `foo.scala` is an empty file, also does not work but in a different way: there is no output shown at all.

The second problem is that `fsc foo.scala -asdf` gives a curious error message:
{code}
(FakePos(fsc),bad option: '-asdf'
  fsc -help  gives more information)
{code}

There should be no FakePos in the output.

These are little things, but they would be nice to clean up.
The handling of informative messages in CompileServer and in Main was duplicated, and the two copies slowly diverged over time.
The code has now been refactored, cleaned up, and made more general.

The FakePos(fsc) message was due to a missing override def toString.

Both problems are fixed.
