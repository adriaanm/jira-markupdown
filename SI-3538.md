The Numeric (+ Integral and Fractional) and Ordering traits include implicit conversions to allow operators to be used. Eg.

```scala
def testOrdering[T](a: T, b: T)(implicit ev: Ordering[T]) = { 
  import ev._
  a < b
}
```

However, if a context bound is used instead of an explicit implicit (!?) parameter, this becomes more difficult:

```scala
def testOrderingCtx[T: Ordering](a: T, b: T) = { 
  val ord = implicitly[Ordering[T]]               
  import ord._ 
  a < b
}
```

If the following method is added to the Ordering companion object
```scala
object Ordering {
  implicit def ops[A: Ordering](a: A) = implicitly[Ordering[A]].mkOrderingOps(a)
}
```
this can be written more simply as

```scala
def testOrderingCtx2[T: Ordering](a: T, b: T) = { 
  import Ordering.ops 
  a < b
}
```

Similarly, the following could be added to the Numeric, Fractional and Integral companion objects respectively
```scala
implicit def ops[A : Numeric](a: A) = implicitly[Numeric[A]].mkNumericOps(a)
```
```scala
implicit def ops[A : Fractional](a: A) = implicitly[Fractional[A]].mkNumericOps(a)
```
```scala
implicit def ops[A : Integral](a: A) = implicitly[Integral[A]].mkNumericOps(a)
```
There may be obstacles, but here is the kind of improvement I was holding out for.
```scala
implicit def compareComparables[T](x: T)(implicit ord: Ordering[T]): Ordering[T]#Ops = new ord.Ops(x)
```
With that we're down to
```scala
def testOrderingCtx[T: Ordering](a: T, b: T) = a < b
```
Hard to beat.
In r24468 I added implicits which allow the following:
```scala
import Ordering.Implicits._
import Numeric.Implicits._

def f1[T: Numeric](x: T, y: T, z: T)  = x + y + z
def f2[T: Ordering](x: T, y: T, z: T) = if (x < y) (z > y) else (x < z)
```
They need to be imported (but they are in a trait for easy access, so you can e.g. mix that into a package object if you want them accessible everywhere in your project.) I tried to throw in Integral/Fractional too but I couldn't outrun the misdesign's intersection with implicit search.  I don't see this improving much anytime soon and deem this complete.
