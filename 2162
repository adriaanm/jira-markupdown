THe following code will also yield a VerifyError in Scala 2.8 r19180 ... possibly that is why the ticket's name was changed to something more general?

{code}
class Test[A](implicit val m:Manifest[A])
class Foo
class Bar extends Test[Foo]
new Bar
{code}

(note Bar is a 'class' above, not an 'object' as in the prior test cases)
