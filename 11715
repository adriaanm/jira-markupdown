I've reopened since we have more info, but I still can't reproduce with the build.sbt you provide (I did have to add some empty lines between settings as required by 0.13.7) and my existing <sub>/.ivy2 | </sub>/.sbt nor fresh ones.

I used the following plugins.sbt:
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.13.0")
```

Same story for unmodified build.sbt and sbt 0.13.8-RC1
