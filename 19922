On page: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.7/index.html#scala.math.Ordered when the ordering is set to ??By inheritance??, the following is printed (above the [<|http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.7/index.html#scala.math.Ordered@<(that:A):Boolean] method): 
{noformat}
Inherited by implicit conversion orderingToOrdered from Ordered[A] to Ordered[Ordered[A]]
{noformat}
, which is confusing and wrong. See also [this comment|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/386#issuecomment-163521611].
