[Elided very sloppy report, replacing with substance.]
```scala
import scala.actors.Actor._

object Test {
  val impl: Actor = actor {
    loop {
      react { 
        case 1 => impl ! 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Notice scala.actors.Actor is not imported.  scalac crashes during compilation, but only if continuations are enabled.
(In r22539) Added test case for see #3628 in pending.
This has already been fixed.  I have attached a patch that moves phaller's test from pending into files/continuations-neg and corrects the expected output.  It's not a very deep patch, but it does allow this bug to be closed.

Being that this moves files, you'll want to apply it with:

```
patch -p0 -E -i t3628.diff
svn rm test/pending/continuations-neg/t3628.check test/pending/continuations-neg/t3628.scala
svn add test/files/continuations-neg/t3628.check test/files/continuations-neg/t3628.scala
```
(extempore in [r25418](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25418)) Moved test out of pending, closes #3628, no review.
