Oh, and we should stay open to the idea of a conservative partial-revert for 2.10.2; leaving the a progression for 2.11.x. I'm not quite sure how that would play out as SI-6846 itself fixed a regression.

I suppose it would be good to try to construct a simpler test that exhibits the same problem to gauge where this lands on the esoteric-o-meter.

Paul, perhaps could you discuss this one with Adriaan?
