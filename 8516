Here's a simple implementation of :reset -classpath my.jar.  Supplying settings args to reset and replay does a destructive creation, as in the old days.  There's a todo comment for require, which would use fancy tricks for that dynamic feeling.

This is convenient because some settings get baked in, so :settings doesn't take.  And :replay -Xlint is handy to show behavior under different settings.

Also, my impression is that the world belongs to the shapeless.
