Ok, so it's a different bug now, really.   No longer class cast exception, but the CanBuildFrom's are all off.

Here's a relevant snippet with the types inferred:

{code}
scala> val x = collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(1,2,3)
x: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)

scala> x.view
res1: scala.collection.mutable.IndexedSeqView[Int,scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]] = SeqView(...)

scala> res1 map (_ + "0")
res2: scala.collection.SeqView[String,scala.collection.mutable.Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)
{code}


We loose the IndexedSeqView after a map, which tells me either (a) it's not overridden (likely) or (b) it's missing an appropriate CanBuildFrom.    If the answer is (a), I'll have to dig further.  This may be a limitation on IndexedSeqView that *after* a transformation operation, you shouldn't treat it as an IndexedSeq anymore.
