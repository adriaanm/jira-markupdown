it's not about package objects:

{code}
scala> class a { @deprecated("") val x = 1 }
<console>:4: warning: value x in class a is deprecated: 
       class a { @deprecated("") val x = 1 }
                                     ^
defined class a
{code}

the point is that the `@deprecated` annotation gets copied to the field, not to the getter / setter. when the getter passes !RefCheck the deprecation message is issued.

to get the expected behavior:

{code}
scala> class a { @(deprecated @annotation.target.getter @annotation.target.setter)("") val x = 1 }
defined class a

scala> (new a).x
<console>:6: warning: value x in class a is deprecated: 
       (new a).x
               ^
res0: Int = 1
{code}


I'll fix this by allowing the `@annotation.target` meta-annotations directly on annotation class (not only on class type when using the annotation)
