My mistake - wrong changeset number, I meant the "correction" should be between 2.7.1.r15653 and 2.7.1.r15553, most likely. I went through the code roughly but noticed nothing strange there. The background color fixed to system white (there is no sense to change it in the system, that would affect badly many other applications) is really annoying for people using dark backgrounds. Returning to 2.7.1.14646-RC1_0 makes no sense, even if the background color works, there is too many other inconveniences.

For quicker reproduction: background/foreground settings are in Preferences->General->Editors->Text Editors - it works immediately with any java file, and does not with any scala file.
