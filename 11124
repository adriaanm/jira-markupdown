I have the same problem with an inner trait:

{code}
trait A {
  trait Test
  val instance: Test = new Test { }
}

class B extends A {
  override object instance extends Test
}


object Run extends App {
  val b = new B
}
{code}

gives java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&signature in class file B

However, when making trait A a class, the problem disappears on both 2.10.4 and 2.11.5.

The wordaround is to use something along the lines of:
{code}
  override val instance = new Test { }
{code}
