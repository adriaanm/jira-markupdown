I'd like to suggest adding a "`replace`" method to `Regex.Match`, so that a string replacement can be done without having to re-match -- which might even be impossible when iterating over matches.

Here is an example of usage -- a snippet of code that I have adapted to make use of it. The original can be found at http://speaking-my-language.blogspot.com/2009/12/string-interpolation-in-scala.html.

```scala
trait InterpolationContext {
  class InterpolatedString(val s: String) {

    def i = interpolate(s)
  }

  implicit def str2interp(s: String) = new InterpolatedString(s)

  def interpolate(s: String) = {
    var result = ""
    for (m <- "\\$\\{(.+?)\\}".r.findAllIn(s).matchData) {
      val matchString = m.matched
      var identifier = m.group(1)
      try {
        val method = this.getClass.getMethod(identifier)
        result = m.replace(method.invoke(this).toString)
      } catch {
        case _: NoSuchMethodException =>
      }
    }
    if (result.isEmpty) s else result
  }
}

object Test extends InterpolationContext {
  val a = "3"
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("expanded: ${a}; not expanded: ${b}; more text".i)
  }
}
```

I'm attaching a possible implementation of such feature, which also adds a "`replaced`" method which returns, at any time, the present replacement string.
(In r20661) Replacement in matching can now be done by providing function arguments for replacement. Fixes #2761.

Hello!

This is true. However, the underlying Java Matcher requires a Java StringBuffer for the `append*` methods. Neither a Java StringBuilder, nor Scala StringBuilder subclass it, so it seems to me I am unable to provide it something other than a java.lang.StringBuffer.

Hello,

Oh yes, that's right.  How annoying!  Nevermind then.

I have just realized the `replace` is not on the `Match`, but on the `Iterator`. While I think the function-receiving `replaceAllIn` is better than having a `replace` on `Match`, they are not mutually exclusive. So I'd like to understand what was the reasoning here.
Aleksandar, I have been considering r20661, reviewing old stuff, and gathering some input. The solution put forth in r20661 is not the one mentioned in this ticket, but it comes close. There is one problem that the solution in this ticket solves that the one proposed would not solve: efficiency when not all matches are replaced.

Now, what was implemented corresponds to a couple of alternatives put forth in an e-mail I sent to scala-debate called "Enhancement Proposal: Regex Replace", back in december, the fourth.

At that time, the only input I got back with a preference opted for Match => Option[String], and conjured the hypothesis of something converting partial functions into this (which later became to be in the method "lift", added by Martin).

Also, Ijuma has expressed a certain discontent with replaceAllMatchDataIn, due to the excessive verbosity. Personally, I'd like the operators <sub>=, </sub> and ~~, handling most of the present functionality through polymorphism, and something which does not exist yet (boolean matching), but that's something I only intend to put forth more to the future. It strikes me as an interesting coincidence, however, that this method corresponds to option 4, close to option 5, in that e-mail, and is also a new method, as opposed to the polymorphism of replaceAllIn.

So I'm pondering discarding this method, and coming with a different one for option five: replaceSelectively or replaceOption, (Match) => Option[String]. We avoid "all" to reinforce not everything may be replaced, and we make the name shorter by not having to state Match explicitly to avoid Function-erased clash.

It lacks symmetry, I'll grant, but replaceAllIn works for the simple cases, while this one acts as power users last resort. Besides, the current Regex library doesn't have symmetry going for it anyway.

If, on the other hand, you think this should be subjected to more discussion (I *did* try to raise a discussion on debate...), I ask for replaceAllMatchDataIn to be removed until such a date as we feel comfortable with any decision. The function-receiving replaceAllIn ought to be kept as is, however, as it is a natural extension of replaceAllIn, and is very useful.

The more I think about it, the more I like the name `replaceSome`. The english meaning fits, and it also fits that it replaces only when the function returns `Some`, doing nothing when it returns `None`.

I brought the subject up on debate again, to see if some discussion can be generated.
