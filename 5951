If you really think there is a bug involving the one-element case, you should produce the code which handles that case differently.  Or does your next comment indicate you realize there is no such issue? In any case please don't reopen this, there's no bug.
```scala
  def sum[B >: A](implicit num: Numeric[B]): B = foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)
```
