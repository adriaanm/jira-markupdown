It appears some local members are not always initialized properly.  I was not able to come up with a small isolated test-case for the behavior but the pattern is this:

```scala
object Foo {
  private def iterate(n: Int) = new Iterator[Int] {
    private val _iter = MyIterator.iterate(n)
    override def hasNext = _iter.hasNext
    override def next()  = _iter.next()
  }
}
```

The bytecode generated for the anonymous inner class does not properly initialize the _iter member so it is left to its initial "null" value and calling hasNext() results in a NPE.

In the code above, `MyIterator.iterate(n)` is guaranteed to result in a non-null Iterator instance, e.g.,

```scala
object MyIterator {
  def iterate(n: Int) = new MyIterator(...)
}

class MyIterator(...) extends Iterator[Int] {
  ...
}
```

Curiously, converting the anonymous inner class to a named inner class avoids the issue:

```scala
object Foo {
  private def iterate(n: Int) = new FooIterator(n)

  class FooIterator(n: Int) extends Iterator[Int] {
      private val _iter = MyIterator.iterate(n)
      override def hasNext = _iter.hasNext
      override def next()  = _iter.next()
    }
  }
}
```
