in the example below, the namespace of 'attr' should be "http://example.org/foo"

<root xmlns="http://example.org/foo">
  <node attr="foo"/>
</root>

The method getNamespace is defined in UnprefixedAttribute as:
  final def getNamespace(owner: Node): String = null

I think it should be
  final def getNamespace(owner: Node): String = owner.getNamespace(null)
Replying to [comment:2 ittayd]:
> it is unprefixed, so it has the default namespace. 

Look, all I've got to go on is what the guy who wrote the code says.  Four years ago in r4058 he checked in this implementation:
```scala
+  /** returns null */
+  final def getNamespace(owner: Node): String = 
+    null;
```
I'd say "final", "null", and the elaboratory comment "returns null" indicate pretty transparently that it was intentional.  For extra redundancy this comment leads the file:
```scala
/** Unprefixed attributes have the null namespace, and no prefix field
```
And that is what the implementation has been for the 17000 commits since r4058.  So if you want to reopen this ticket, please get buraq to sign off on it.  I can't evaluate the argument on its merits because it would require deeper understanding of xml than I possess or desire.  But I can easily say that changing the behavior of some of the oldest code in trunk is going to require more than someone's claim that it ought to be different.
