After a longish discussion, we think this behavior is surprising, but not a bug. 

The first issue is that a pattern `case Seq() =>` is a sequence pattern that matches **any** empty sequence. On the other hand, `Seq.empty` returns **some specific** default implementation of sequences, and it happens to be a mutable sequence. 

The second issue is that for mutable sequences `equals` is reference equality (there's a long thread on the mailing list about equality for mutable data structures), therefore `Seq.empty` can't match **any** empty sequence.
