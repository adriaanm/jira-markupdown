I saw that according [to the roadmap](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12-roadmap), ****full**** source compatibility to 2.11 is intended. This leaves no other option than keeping the current version, even though the incompatibility can be assumed to be only theoretical. However, `PartiallyOrdered` should at least be deprecated.
