Problem in Scala 2.8.x:

With the change to named parameters r17916 a MethodType has now a list of Symbols for the formal parameters instead of the types. 

When the Reifier is trying to convert such a type to scala.reflect.MethodType it calls
```scala
reflect.MethodType(params.map(reify), reify(result))
```
where `reify` references the reification function for symbols which looks principally good. 

However, in `reify(Symbol)` the symbol isn't reified at all, because it has an owner term set but `NoSymbol` is returned:
```scala
if (sym.owner.isTerm)
      reflect.NoSymbol
```

This makes `scala.reflect.Code` pretty much useless if you have to detect which overloaded method alternative the Scala compiler chose before because all the information is now thrown away and can't be restored.

I attached a short patch which to create correct symbol information. I wasn't quite sure, what the correct Symbol would be so I chose LocalValue(NoSymbol, ...) quite arbitrarily.
(In r20712) close #2886 (applied patch). no review
