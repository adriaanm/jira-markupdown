It was working in 2.11.0-M6 and previous.
Behaviour changed in 210dbc7 / #3346
Here's a smaller, closely related case:

```scala
trait E1[T] {
  def f(that: T) = ()
}

class E2[R, C] extends E1[E2[R, C]]

object MyApp {
  implicit def int2string(value: Int): String = ???
  implicit def coef2rf[D, R, C](value: D)(implicit ev: D => C): E1[E2[R, C]] = ???

  def test: Unit = {

    val y: E2[E1[String], String] = ???
    val i: Int = 0
    i.f(y)
    i.f(y) // chokes on the second occurence only (!)
    ()
  }
}
```
Changing the order of `int2string` and `coef2rf` the the code in the comment just above leads to the failure in the first instance.

The order that implicit candidates are tried is dynamic based on frequency of applicability. See:

```scala
// Implicits.scala
        // most frequent one first
        val sorted = matches sortBy (x => if (isView) -x.useCountView else -x.useCountArg)
```
As Jason suggested, I think you'll have to work around this in your code by defining an ordering.
The example below works for me. I think #3346 is pretty nice to have fixed, so I'd rather not give it up for this.

I'm sorry, but we're out of time for 2.11. I'll leave it open for a couple more days, but, unless I'm missing something, I think we should anticipate closing this as won't fix.

```scala
trait E1[T] {
  def f(that: T) = ()
}
 
class E2[R, C] extends E1[E2[R, C]]

trait Lower {
  implicit def int2string(value: Int): String = ???
} 

object MyApp extends Lower{
  implicit def coef2rf[D, R, C](value: D)(implicit ev: D => C): E1[E2[R, C]] = ???
 
  def test: Unit = {
 
    val y: E2[E1[String], String] = ???
    val i: Int = 0
    i.f(y)
    i.f(y) // chokes on the second occurence only (!)
    ()
  }
}
```
I think there is a double mistake here.

1) the fact that reordering imports can change compilation success is a different issue than the original one.
2) Jason showed that the effect of #3346 on my code can be countered by removing sortBy in Implicits.scala, hence there is no need to revert that change.

In support of 1), removing sortBy does not fix compilation failure on the first occurrence (i.e. when int2string is moved after coef2rf). It does fix failure on the second occurence.

Regarding my code, I have found a workaround of my own, but yours may be good too, I have to check it.

Still, I think this bug (the original one, causing failure on the second identical line) is worth fixing (and simple to fix, see https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3408 about how removing sortBy has no effect on performance). Hence I have created a new pull request https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3540
If there's an error due to a certain sort order, I suspect the bug is that the error isn't reported for all sort orders, not the other way around.
Could you comment on why the proposed workaround isn't viable for you? I would recommend against walking this fine line of exploiting implicit search implementation details.
