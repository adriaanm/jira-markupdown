In 2.7.7.final I was trying to implement an interface defined in Java that had a method parameter named "match" which of course makes the Scala compiler mad :-)

So, I just wrote the parameter name as `match` and that seemed to satisfy Scala just fine. The same technique allowed me to call the `match` method of another object written in Java inside that method too. Thats great!

But it turns out that due to some introspection going on at runtime in the framework I'm using, it is important that down in the bytecode with debugging info the parameter name must exactly match that of the interface being implemented, namely "match" but it is getting compiled down to "match$$1" which throws off the framework.

Seems like I should be able to count on `match` compiling down to just match in the bytecode in the parameter case just as it compiles down to calling the match() method on a Java class not match$$1().
Hmmmm... It appears unrelated to the use of the backticks. I changed it to "matching" instead of "match" with backticks and still my framework complains that the argument name is unexpected:

    def findModulesMatching(repository: String, matching: Map[String, Object]): List[Module] = { ... }

These are the parameters of the method: [repository, matching$$1]

Not sure why the compiler appended $$1 to one of the parameter names and not the other...

Hmm... Well I can work on trying to isolate it down to a small repro case but I can't send you all the source for where I first discovered it because that is for work.

Here is an excerpt of running "javap" command for the .class file compiled by the 2.7.7.final eclipse plugin, where you can see there is indeed the $$ thingee going on:

javap -l -classpath ... RepoHandler

...

public java.util.List findModulesMatching(java.lang.String, java.util.Map);
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 153: 0
   line 155: 6
   line 157: 17
   line 158: 26
   line 178: 54

  LocalVariableTable: 
   Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
   0      64      0    this       LRepoHandler;
   0      64      1    repository       Ljava/lang/String;
   0      64      2    match$$1       Ljava/util/Map;
   0      64      3    repo$$1       LRepository;
   6      58      4    entries       Ljava/util/Collection;
   17      47      5    modules$$1       Ljava/util/Set;

For source code

    def findModulesMatching(repository: String, `match`: Map[String, Object]): List[Module] = { ... }

NOTE: there are backticks around "match" in the Scala source even if they don't show up the way the ticket renders.

Before I try a limited repro I will try compiling this same source with the command-line compiler and see if it does the same thing.


Lets try that again

OK so I get the same thing from the command-line compiler

OK. Here's a the result of compiling the Handler.scala file I just attached. Its pretty minimal in the sense that when I delete things the problem goes away.
