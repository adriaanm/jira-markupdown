This inspired me to come up with this:
```scala
object A {
  @static val x = y
  val y = 10
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(A.x)
  }
}
```

this will print 10 as expected. Now put @static in front of y:
```scala
object A {
  @static val x = y
  @static val y = 10
}
```

and you'll get 0 printed.
