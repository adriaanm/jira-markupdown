Currently, only TupleN classes inherit from ProductN.

Case classes should also inherit from ProductN, where N is the value of the productArity of the case class. 
Basically, it's inconsistent with case class inheritance. Suppose I have

```scala
  case class Foo(foo : String, bar : Int);
  case class Baz(baz : Int, bloop : String) extends Foo(bloop, baz);
```

This would have to extend both Product2[String, Int] and Product2[Int, String], which isn't allowed. 
Ok, I understand the rationale. Case class inheritance really seems to be a minefield (I'm sorry I asked for it back on the pre-trac days :).

Anyway, for my use case I just wanted to have the arity of the case class encoded in the type system. I don't need to know the actual types of the arguments. I was hoping to do something like:

```scala
abstract class Arity
abstract class N1 extends Arity
abstract class N2 extends Arity
abstract class N3 extends Arity
//...

class FiniteProduct[A <% Arity](val p:Product)

implicit def productArity1(p:Product1[_]) = new FiniteProduct[N1](p)
implicit def productArity2(p:Product2[_,_]) = new FiniteProduct[N2](p)
implicit def productArity3(p:Product3[_,_,_]) = new FiniteProduct[N3](p)
//...
//Note that the implicit defs above forget the argument types

def table[P <% FiniteProduct[_]](rows:List[P]) = Do something knowing that all products in rows have the same arity
```

Should I take this to the mailing lists or open another ticket (or forget about this kind of guarantee and sulk)?
(extempore in [r25336](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25336)) As per discussion documented in #1799, brought back the ProductN
traits and synthesized them into case classes. It's -Xexperimental for
now because there may be minor implications for existing code which
should be discussed. And also because I snuck in another "improvement"
but it's probably too dangerous to be touching productIterator directly
and it should go into something else.

  scala> case class Bippy(x: Int, y: Int)
  defined class Bippy

  scala> Bippy(5, 10).productIterator
  res0: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator
                 ^^^----- as opposed to Iterator[Any]

There is an even better idea available than lubbing the case class field
types: it starts with "H" and ends with "List"...

Review by oderksy.
(extempore in [r25725](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25725)) ProductN, and method synthesis toolbox.

- Finished giving case classes a ProductN parent, and flipped it on.
The "finish" part involved not breaking existing code where case classes
manually extend the appropriate ProductN.  (Like, Tuple 1-22.)

- Generalized most of SyntheticMethods to ease method creation
and class manipulation in general.

- Fixed bugs related to the above, like the fact that this used to
be a compile error:

  scala> case class Foo() extends Serializable
  <console>:28: error: trait Serializable is inherited twice
         case class Foo() extends Serializable
                                  ^
It feels like there's a better way to eliminate the duplicate parents,
but after spending a lot of time chasing my tail in that peril-fraught
zone between namer and typer, I don't see an easy path to improve on
it.  Closes #1799.  For that modification to Typers, review by odersky.
The good news is that nobody has figured out the problem. But some of the relevant tickets are #5119, #5082, #5084. Sorry about the uninformative message. The issue is cycles between classes and their companions; there is already a lot of tension there, and ProductN pushed it over the limit between the companion object apply method, the type parameters to the ProductN parent, the synthesized copy method, the fact that the class often refers to aliases which reside in the companion object, and whatever else there is.
I'm hopeful that #5082 untied the knot.
