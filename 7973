A temporary bandaid in
  https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/858
avoids the exception and emits a warning instead (including source code position).

Please give it a try, the information thus gained will help in 
- minimizing the example, and
- finding the root cause of the problem (ie where GenICode emits unbalanced debug scopes for local variables).
