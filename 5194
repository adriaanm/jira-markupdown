But an addendum: now having verified that the symptomatic fix does not break anything we have a test for, we shouldn't let its imperfection keep us from committing it: it's a single spectacularly well-localized line, rather a long ways from the worst hack in the compiler.  This goes double if the proper fix is indeed heavy and code-touchy.

NOW we'll find out who's the bad guy!
