I have long time problem in Scala Eclipse plugin.
If I open scala source file syntax highlighting is lost. 
After editing and saving highlighting comes back.

Today I noticed how this problem is related to source files encoding and comments.
Traditionally my source files are in ISO-8859-1.

Let’s create simple class.

class Simple {

  var alfa = 300		// Comment
}

Save and reopen. Highlighting is OK.
Now change comment.

class Simple {

  var alfa = 300		// Comment ���
}

Save and reopen. Highlighting is LOST.

If I use UTF-8 as source file encoding Highlighting does not disappear even with ‘���’ characters.

So, is it possible to use ISO-8859-1 as source file encoding without losing Highlighting ?


Current configuration:
Eclipse SDK   Version: 3.4.2
Build id: M20090211-1700
ch.epfl.lamp.sdt_2.8.0.r17382-b20090326023419.zip


Thanks

I am using Eclipse 3.5.1 with Scala 2.8r19928 on Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) and I cannot reproduce this bug.

The step I follow are:
 1. Create Scala Project
 2. Set the default encoding to ISO-8859-1 (via Project properties)
 3. Create a Scala file with some arbitrary code
 4. Save the file
 5. Paste the comment _// Comment ���_ from the bug report above
 6. Save, close and reopen the file
 7. Add some code and save the file several times trying to trigger the bug


At all times the syntax highlighting works as expected.
