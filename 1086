I can't really see any way that this is something specific to the interpreter.  I think it is probably just related to general Array craziness.  For example, I can produce the same exception with the following code 
```scala
object O extends Application {
  val arr = Array(0,1,2)
  val x = arr.toArray[Any]
  println(x(0))
}
```
