hi,

i am finding myself often writing something like:
```scala
   var group: Option[ Group ]  = None
```
but also:
```scala
   var group = List.empty[ Group ]
```
or
```scala
   var group = Queue.empty[ Group ]
```
etc.

given that Option already has a method isEmpty which you use to determine if it is None, i was wondering if not the following new method would be a logical consequence:

```scala
   var group = Option.emtpy[ Group ]
```

that at least is more clean than using the apply method which for some reason supports null versus non-null (group = Option[ Group ]( null ))...
(In r22473) Option gets an empty factory like the collections.  Closes #3414, no review.
