hi,

i am finding myself often writing something like:
{code}
   var group: Option[ Group ]  = None
{code}
but also:
{code}
   var group = List.empty[ Group ]
{code}
or
{code}
   var group = Queue.empty[ Group ]
{code}
etc.

given that Option already has a method isEmpty which you use to determine if it is None, i was wondering if not the following new method would be a logical consequence:

{code}
   var group = Option.emtpy[ Group ]
{code}

that at least is more clean than using the apply method which for some reason supports null versus non-null (group = Option[ Group ]( null ))...

(In r22473) Option gets an empty factory like the collections.  Closes SI-3414, no review.
