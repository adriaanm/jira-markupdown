I expect
{code}
  /** One
    * `two` three */ 
{code}
to be equivalent to
{code}
  /** One `two` three */
{code}
but it is instead equivalent to
{code}
  /** One`two` three */
{code}
Is this intended?

This behavior is also seen for italic, bold, underline, superscript, and subscript wiki markup.
Note that this doesn't seem to occur when using the more normal indentation style
{code}
  /** One
   *  `two` three */
{code}

The indentation in the bug is the style recommended by the Scaladoc wiki for authors [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/Scaladoc/AuthorDocs]
Hi, I wrote a patch for fix this issue. {{inline0()}} should not remove skipped "\n".
