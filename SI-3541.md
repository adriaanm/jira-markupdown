I expect
```scala
  /** One
    * `two` three */ 
```
to be equivalent to
```scala
  /** One `two` three */
```
but it is instead equivalent to
```scala
  /** One`two` three */
```
Is this intended?

This behavior is also seen for italic, bold, underline, superscript, and subscript wiki markup.
Note that this doesn't seem to occur when using the more normal indentation style
```scala
  /** One
   *  `two` three */
```

The indentation in the bug is the style recommended by the Scaladoc wiki for authors [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/Scaladoc/AuthorDocs]
Hi, I wrote a patch for fix this issue. `inline0()` should not remove skipped "\n".
