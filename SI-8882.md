The following code fails to compile due to what seems like incorrect type inference when two classes share a higher-kinded type ancestor.

```scala
import scala.language.higherKinds

class A[T[_]]
object B extends A[List]
object C extends A[Option]

// This compiles
val values = Seq[Any](B, C) 
// This doesn't
val values = Seq(B, C)
```

The error:
```
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : B.type
 required: A[_ >: Option with List <: Product]
       val values = Seq(B, C)
                        ^
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : C.type
 required: A[_ >: Option with List <: Product]
       val values = Seq(B, C)
                           ^
```

The expected behaviour, I would think, would be to infer the type of Any, as it would for Seq(B, 42).
I'm going to merge this with #3528. Thanks for the tiny minimization.
