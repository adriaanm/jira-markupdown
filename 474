Imports are relative in Scala, i.e., the compiler searches for `TestClass` in the innermost available package/val/object `a`, which is package `foo.a`. Hence, you are really trying to import `foo.a.TestClass`. Use the `_root_` prefix to make an import absolute:
```scala
import _root_.a.TestClass
```
