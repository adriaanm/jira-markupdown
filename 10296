I was able to instantly reproduce the issue by launching scala via drip (I too am on OSX 10.9) but I use scala all day every day and I've never seen it under any other conditions. So I think it is more likely that you still had some kind of residual drip issue. It could still be a scala bug which is only triggered by drip though.
