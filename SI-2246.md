(originally reported as contrib701, see pos/contrib701, but was masked by #513)

The following code causes a loop in subtype checking:

```scala
trait B {
  type A[T] >: A[A[T]]
}
```

The reason is:

```scala
         sym2.isAbstractType && isDifferentType(tp2, tp2.bounds.lo) && (tp1 <:< tp2.bounds.lo)
```

the checks are  (roughly)

```scala
Nothing <: A[T]
  A[T] is different from A[A[T]]
  Nothing <: A[A[T]]
   A[A[T]] is different from A[A[A[T]]]
   Nothing <: A[A[A[T]]]
      ....
```

I propose to change `isDifferentType` to `isDifferentTypeConstructor`, which only checks the head of a type, ignoring type arguments of TypeRef's.
For now `typeConstructor` is indeed only called with argument `true`, but my patch for type constructor inference calls it with `false`. However, with your approach of comparing type symbols, the case for `true` will go away. I'll remove the definition of `typeConstructor` and re-introduce it when integrating support for tcpoly inference.

I had a look at `isHKSubType0`, and I think the case where `isDifferentTypeConstructor` is called was moot: it can(/should) never return `true`.

```scala
// @assume tp1.isHigherKinded || tp2.isHigherKinded
  def isHKSubType0(tp1: Type, tp2: Type, depth: Int): Boolean = (
    tp1.typeSymbol == NothingClass 
    ||
    tp2.typeSymbol == AnyClass // @M Any and Nothing are super-type resp. subtype of every well-kinded type
    || // @M! normalize reduces higher-kinded case to PolyType's
    ((tp1.normalize, tp2.normalize) match {
      case (PolyType(tparams1, res1), PolyType(tparams2, res2)) => // @assume tp1.isHigherKinded && tp2.isHigherKinded (as they were both normalized to PolyType)
        tparams1.length == tparams2.length &&
        List.forall2(tparams1, tparams2) (
          (p1, p2) => p2.info.substSym(tparams2, tparams1) <:< p1.info) &&
        res1 <:< res2.substSym(tparams2, tparams1)
      
      case (_, _) => false // @assume !tp1.isHigherKinded || !tp2.isHigherKinded 
      // --> thus, cannot be subtypes (Any/Nothing has already been checked)
    }))
```


I've replaced calls to `isDifferentTypeConstructor(tp1, tp2)` with `hasDifferentTypeSymbol(sym1, tp2)` 
where `(sym1 eq tp1.typeSymbolDirect) && sym1.isAbstractType`, and `hasDifferentTypeSymbol` is:

```scala
def hasDifferentTypeSymbol(sym: Symbol, tp: Type): Boolean = {
  // assert(sym.isAbstractType)
  sym ne tp.typeSymbol
}
```

I'm now testing and will commit these changes if everything passes, if that's alright with you.
