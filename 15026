I think the naming of the methods "drop" / "dropRight" is bad and confusing. I can see some similarity to "foldLeft" and "foldRight" which are more clear. I suggest that[[BR]]
[[BR]]
- either "drop" is accordingly renamed to "dropLeft"[[BR]]
- or alternatively, I think renaming "dropRight" to "keep" would greatly enhance legibility.
