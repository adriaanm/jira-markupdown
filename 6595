Martin: only classes can be companions, type alias should not be considered
top-level type aliased (in package objects) conflict with the top-level class that's created speculatively before parsing a class file

synonymous class and type alias in the same scope is not allowed -- can we delay creating the class symbol without knowing we need to? 

object and type alias should be allowed to co-exist (however, class and type alias is not allowed)
