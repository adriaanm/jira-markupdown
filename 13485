The way the new plugin currently works, whenever you enter "case" within a match expression, the line is unindented two spaces.  Thus, it requires a remarkably high number of keystrokes to obtain the following format:
```scala
expr match {
  case 1 => ...
  case 2 => ...
}
```

Is there any way this "feature" could be disabled?  Or, even better, made an option?
