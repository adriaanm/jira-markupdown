If you have a class that extends Enumeration that defines the actual Enumeration and then have a companion object extends from that class, the string values of the enumeration values is improperly handled.  For example:
```scala
class Foo extends Enumeration {
  val A = Value
}
object Foo extends Foo
```
...and then you try to print Foo.A, it'll print "<Invalid enum: no field for #0>" rather than "A".
