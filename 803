As well as the working cases you've liste, I'm able to ctrl-click and navigate from a Scala project to another Scala project, from a Scala project to a Java project and a Java project to a Scala project. Ctrl-click not working relative to an unbuilt or only partially built project is expected behaviour.

If you can put together a small reproducible example of a case where navigation fails, please reopen this with the project(s) attached.
