> It would make sense to move them, when (if ever) Scala gets type constraints a la C#. Or maybe someone finds a clever way to code this using implicits..

could it be as simple as this?
{code}
def max[A](Iterable[A])(implicit f : A => Ordered[A]): A = ...
{code}

an existing example of this technique in the standard library is this, from List.scala:
{code}
  def flatten[B](implicit f : A => Iterable[B]) : List[B] = ...
{code}
