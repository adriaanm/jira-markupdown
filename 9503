I'm pretty sure that bridges have to be based on the Scala typesystem. Brian's JVMLS talk on the matter was really helpful to me to understand why its non-trivial to just do them in the VM (and I think the same arguments prevent us from making it a back-end only affair).

I actually got part of the way there to installing additional bridges in mixin: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/3452-rebased (please excuse the expasperated messaage-free commits at the end of the sequence!) but was lucky enough that a test (or the library) alerted me to a corner case that resulted from spreading responsibility for bridges across two phases. The root complexity is, as you point out, running mixin after erasure. Martin told me he's going to try it **way** earlier next time around, all the way back in extension methods.
