Using both, eclipse plugin as well as scala, from today's revision (2.8.0.r22036-b20100526020129).

The valid use of "@ _*" is correctly compiled by scala but fails to be parsed in the eclipse plugin.
Example:
```scala
object RemainingArgs {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {  }
  
  	val aString = "Eclipse plugin cannot not handle this"
  	val Array( who, what @ _* ) = aString split (" ")
  	
}
```
I have also encountered the similar problem with scalac and on REPL,

```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r22036-b20100526020129 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.

scala> val List(x@_*)=List(0)
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple pattern
       val List(x@_*)=List(0)

```
Replying to [comment:4 lukas.pustina]: Good catch ... done.
this isn't specific to the Eclipse plugin. the 2.8.0.RC3 command line compiler gives:
```scala
  ~> scalac28 S.scala
S.scala:6: error: illegal start of simple pattern
  	val Array( who, what @ _* ) = aString split (" ")
                                  ^
```
(In r22159) Reverts r21973, the patch I characterized as "hacky but no-risk"
in my commit message, for causing #3480.  Closes #3480.  I'd say
no review but who can trust a guy who throws around "no risk"
with such abandon.
