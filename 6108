That's a different bug, really, but I'm not in any position to tell you whether to open a new bug or not.

The solution you provided is still suboptimal, however, because whenever you call "next", it will only return after the the _following_ line has read. In other words, you fixed it for first/second line, but it will still happen with second/third, third/fourth, etc. For an example of the sort of problem this can give, see SI-4599.

I think the following would fix it for {{next}}:

{code:scala}
  override def next(): String = {
    if (unread) {
      nextLine = bufReader.readLine
    }
    unread = true
    nextLine
  }
{code}
