if Text("My name is ") followed by Text("Harry") the space following the word "is" will be incorrectly trimmed out.  Adjacent Text nodes need to be combined before whitespace is removed.

{code}
scala> import scala.xml._
import scala.xml._

scala> <div>{Text("My name is ")}{Text("Harry")}</div>
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <div>My name is Harry</div>

scala> Utility.trim(res0)
res1: scala.xml.Node = <div>My name isHarry</div>
{code}

This is important when modifying XML and then trimming it.  For example we might start with <div>My name is <user:name/></div> and then replace the <user:name/> Elem with "Harry" thus leading to the adjacent Text nodes.
I think the semantics that were intended for trim are "collapse the whitespace". That means you can't traverse the tree node by node making decisions about one at a time. You have to examine sequences of text nodes. 

{code}
  @Test def testTrim() {
    val a = new Text("a")
    val sp = new Text(" ")
    val b = new Text("b")
    val data = <data>{ Seq(a, sp, b) }</data>
    println(data) // prints <data>a b</data>
    val trimmed = Utility.trim(data)
    println(trimmed) // prints <data>ab</data> - wrong. 
  }
{code}

You can't trim anything off anything here.
