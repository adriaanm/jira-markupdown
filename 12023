Hi John, I'm not the author of Scalite although I would love to steal the praise ;)
I have worked a lot with both curly-braces (Java, Scala, Javascript, HTML, JSON) and indentation-based (Python, Coffeescript, Haskell, HAML, YAML) languages and I prefer indentation-based syntax as well due to:
- fewer discussions about formatting
- fewer lines of code/noise
- easier visual tracking of nesting
- less noise in Git commits (e.g. trailing commas in list definitions)

I don't think that taking the number of Scalite users as an indicator for desirability of this is a fair assessment, because as I mentioned currently your choice is "ordinary Scala syntax + IDE and many tools" vs. "Scalite syntax - IDE and many tools".

So IMO, it would be great to track how many users share the same opinion/desire (given tooling support were given for the indentation syntax) somewhere.
