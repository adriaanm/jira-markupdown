[~sethtisue] that is something I could not do, but it seems very similar to SI-5366.

This only happened when running all the tests. If I ever did testOnly it would work just fine. Completely weird.

I know this is very few information. But all my tests would never replicate this in an isolated way.

Edit: I only found that SI-5366 was related after I created this issue. I could not get it by the title.
