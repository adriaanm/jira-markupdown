When running the auction.scala example on OS X (10.4.10) these errors appear:

 - When running from the command line (2.6.0-RC3):
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: examples/actors/Auction (wrong name: examples/actors/auction)

and
 - When running in the Eclipse plugin (2.6.3):
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main

Some examples such as pingpong.scala run but others such as computeserver.scala do not. 
Claim "worksforme" is wrong when running the example on MacOS X (He Philipp! Did you try it ?!)
Fixed by renaming class **Auction** to **AuctionActor**
