Several Spark users reported this today and it's breaking our build. I narrowed this down to the following: a trivial project build on Scala 2.10.2 can not resolve artifacts correctly:

{code}
$ echo "scalaVersion := \"2.10.2\"" > build.sbt
$ sbt compile
...
[warn] 	module not found: org.scala-lang#scala-library;2.10.2

{code}

The same code works for 2.10.1 and 2.10.3. The issue seems to be that maven is returning 404 errors for the entire 2.10.2 directory.

{code}
# returns 404
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.10.2/
# works
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-library/2.10.3/
{code}

The error message from sbt seems to imply the artifact or POM can not be downloaded, but from what I can tell, the most likely issue is that the parent directory containing them cannot be listed. I can download the pom and jar easily without any issue. 

As a workaround, if you have access to the machine where the build is running, you can manually populate your ivy cache with the needed jars:

{code}
$ cd ~/.ivy2/cache/org.scala-lang/
$ mkdir -p scala-library && cd scala-library
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterklipfel/scala_koans/master/ivyrepo/cache/org.scala-lang/scala-library/ivy-2.10.2.xml
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterklipfel/scala_koans/master/ivyrepo/cache/org.scala-lang/scala-library/ivydata-2.10.2.properties
$ mkdir -p jars && cd jars
$ wget https://github.com/peterklipfel/scala_koans/raw/master/ivyrepo/cache/org.scala-lang/scala-library/jars/scala-library-2.10.2.jar
{code}
Yes, this very weird, and we don't all get the same results: from my location, I can't even download the jar directly, while apparently you can (different mirrors...).

As a workaround, you can have it download from Sonatype with (in build.sbt):
{code}
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases")
{code}
That workaround isn't working for me ... I'm still seeing [this|https://travis-ci.org/milessabin/shapeless/jobs/31491523] Travis build failure, following [this|https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/commit/4edfc14d89cc2569fe7648d0f634e36ce070f18d] commit.
Things are going back to normal: Travis is finally able to download scala-library and scala-compiler 2.10.2, see [this build for example|https://travis-ci.org/scala/scala-parser-combinators/jobs/31638650].
None of the workarounds I found here or elsewhere was preventing build failures for me, which motivated me to figure out how to suppress the transitive dependency which led to the downloading of redundant 2.10.2 (not to mention 2.10.0 and probably others depending on the plugin selection) artifacts. In project/plugins.sbt:
{code}
 def plugin(m: ModuleID) = Defaults.sbtPluginExtra(m, "0.13", "2.10") excludeAll ExclusionRule("org.scala-lang")

 libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   plugin("me.lessis"    % "bintray-sbt"     % "0.1.2"),
   plugin("com.typesafe" % "sbt-mima-plugin" % "0.1.6")
 )
{code}
