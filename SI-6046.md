For example, the method signature for Map[P,Q].map is:

class Map[P,Q]
def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That 

...however, in the apidocs, the signature is given as:
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That 

The first signature is the congruent with functioning code in 2.8.x and 2.9.x libraries. At first glance this problem seems to be inherent in the generation of the apidocs from the source.
We need to have alpha-renaming in scaladoc to fix this systematically. OR, to fix this particular occurrence, we need to rename the Map type parameters to [K,V] for key and value, making the signature look like:
{code}
def map[B, That](f: ((K, V)) ⇒ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[K, V], B, That]): That 
{code}
and the usecase:
{code}
def map[B, That](f: ((K, V)) ⇒ B): Map[B] // which is incorrect again, see SI-3448
{code}

What do you think?

*And now the long explanation why this signature gets there:*
Method map in scala.collection.Map comes from TraversableLike (which implements the declarations in FilterMonadic and GenTraversableLike):

{code}
trait TraversableLike[+A, +Repr] {
  ...
  def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = {
    val b = bf(repr)
    b.sizeHint(this)
    for (x <- this) b += f(x)
    b.result
  }
  ...
}
{code}

Now, map is inherited into scala.collection.Map by way of: 

{code}
trait Map[A, +B] extends Iterable[(A, B)] with ...
trait Iterable[+A] extends ... with IterableLike[A, Iterable[A]] 
trait IterableLike[+A, +Repr] extends ... with TraversableLike[A, Repr] with ...
{code}

But as you can see, {{Map}} extends {{Iterable[(A, B)]}}, and thus substitutes {{A}} to {{((Map's)A, (Map's)B)}}. And now it's obvious how the signature is generated:

{code}
def map[B, That](f: ((Map's)A, (Map's)B) => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = ...
{code}
I vote against such a symptomatic fix. See  SI-6057 for unexpected collateral damage of renaming type params
Not sure I understand what's happening in SI-6057, but it looks like an error that should be fixed and that shouldn't stop us from renaming.
