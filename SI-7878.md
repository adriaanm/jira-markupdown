I assume it should be safe to use named parameters, even when considering that it is possible to redefine vars in a class as defs instead. Redefining the var as a def instead should not break the code where named parameters are used to specify the parameter value. However, this is not possible: 

```java
package test

object Main extends App {

  val p1 = new Person(lastName = "Bob",firstName = "Svend")
  
  println(p1.firstName) // prints "Svend"

  val p2 = new Person2(lastName = "Bob2",firstName = "Svend2")
  
  println(p2.firstName) // prints "method 'Svend2'"
  p2.firstName_=("X2")
  //p2.firstName = "X2" // not possible because of the parentheses in def firstName(), but the parentheses are required in order to redefine 'firstName' paremeter
  						// kind of ruins the idea of using named parameters along with the flexibility of being able to redefine vars into defs
  						// the compiler error: "reassignment to val"
  
  println(p2.firstName) // prints "method 'X2'"
  
  // works fine, but not as elegant and requires boilerplate getters/setters - also, named parameters are different from actual members 
  val p3 = new Person3(xlastName = "Bob3",xfirstName = "Svend3")
  p3.firstName = "X3"   
  println(p3.firstName) // prints "method 'X'" 
}

class Person (var firstName : String,var lastName : String)

class Person2 (firstName : String,var lastName : String)
{
  private var _firstName : String = firstName // without def firstName() parentheses this will cause compiler to fail
  
  def firstName() = "method '"+_firstName+"'"
  
   def firstName_=(value:String) : Unit = _firstName = value 
}

class Person3 (xfirstName : String,var xlastName : String)
{
  private var _firstName : String = xfirstName 
  
  def firstName = "method '"+_firstName+"'"
  
   def firstName_=(value:String) : Unit = _firstName = value
}
```
"even when considering that it is possible to redefine vars in a class as defs instead"

This is not not allowed. What is happening here is this: you have a constructor parameter "firstName", which may or may not become a class member depending on whether it is used outside the constructor. When you only assign it to a var, then it is not used outside the constructor so it goes away: thus does 'def firstName()' survive. If it is referenced from a method, including 'firstName()', then it gets a field, at which point it is a conflicting definition because you can't overload nullary methods with empty-parameter-list methods.

This is not redefining anything - there is no member "firstName" to redefine, there is only an initial value passed in the constructor (which could be named anything.)
