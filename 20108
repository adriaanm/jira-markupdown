{code}
class C {
  /**
   * @throws java.util.NoSuchElementException when there's none
   */
  def foo = 0
}
{code}

generates a warning that cannot be silenced

{noformat}
Test.scala:2: warning: Could not find any member to link for "java.util.NoSuchElementException".
  /**
  ^
one warning found
{noformat}

also the position of the warning should be improved, currently it's the beginning of the doc comment.
