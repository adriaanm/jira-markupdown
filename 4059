This is all it takes to hit that assertion:
{code}
package object expr {
  object LExpr { }
  class LExpr { }
}
{code}
And this also crashes the compiler.  You can't overload in package objects and apparently you can't stash companions either.  These limitations are no big deal, but it is a problem that the main route to finding out about them is crashing and/or things not compiling for no obvious reason.
