The following shouldn't compile:
```scala
scala> ().asInstanceOf[Int]
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.runtime.BoxedUnit cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer
  at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(BoxesRunTime.java:105)
  ... 32 elided
 
scala> println(().asInstanceOf[Int])
()
```

It is clear that it can't work in the first case because Unit can't be cast to Int. The second case is even more misleading because the cast is optimized away. A compilation error should be the best possible thing in both cases.
