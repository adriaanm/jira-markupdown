2.10.0-RC1 compiler crashes where 2.9.2 and 2.10.0-M7 succeed.
Did not attach error report to RC1 since I was not able to in jira.

In the attachment you can see the error report.

I will try to isolate a piece of code that still shows the crash.

If you can't manage total isolation, at least give us a hint.  Show us how and where Ordering[(X, Y)] is used:
{noformat}
[error] (compile:compile) java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: unexpected constructor erasure scala.math.Ordering[(X, Y)]{val $outer(): Series.this.type} for anonymous class $anon
{noformat}

Looks like this was cleared up with the fix for SI-6648 (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1615).

I'll revert the logging to an assertion.

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1868
Changed the 'Fix version' back to 2.10.0, which is when we shipped the workaround.

The ticket remains open until https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1868 is merged, which will remove the now-obsolete workaround for 2.11.
