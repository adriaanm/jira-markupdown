In section 8.2 we read:

{quote}
A type variable pattern is a simple identifier which starts with a lower case letter.
However, the predefined primitive type aliases unit, boolean, byte, short, char,
int, long, float, and double are not classified as type variable patterns.

However, the primitive type aliases mentioned have been removed. The last sentence should be deleted from the spec.
