Currently

Buffer.+ adds value to this and returns this. But operation + should not have side effect, i. e. + should not change this.

I think <ins>= should be changed to return this, and </ins> should return new buffer:

```scala
/** Append a single element to this buffer and return the identity of the buffer */
def +=(elem: A): Buffer[A]

/** Append a single element to this buffer and return new buffer */
def +(elem: A): Buffer[A]
```

So current code

```scala
buffer + 1 + 2 + 3
```

will be:

```scala
buffer += 1 += 2 += 3
```
I think you are referring to `collection.mutable.Buffer`. It would be nice to have an immutable `Buffer` as well, but for the mutable one I think the current behaviour is ok. Other collections in `mutable`, like `Map`, behave similarly. If you'd like to contribute an immutable Buffer, we'd be very happy to include it in the library. ;-)
I agree with Stepan. That use of + in violation of its usual meaning is quite counter-intuitive. <ins>= doesn't seem quite right either, given the convention in Scala to return Unit. Maybe it should be changed to something like </ins>!.
The library was designed to make it easy to switch from `immutable` collections to `mutable` ones. The behavior of '+', while a bit unintuitive to a new user, is still consistent with the rest of the library, and not weirder than chaining '+='. I still think the solution most in line with the current design is to have an immutable Buffer.
