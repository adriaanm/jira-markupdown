Given the following:
```scala
abstract class A[T <: A[T]] {
  def foo: X[T]
}

class B extends A[B] {
  def foo = new X[B]
} 

class X[T <: A[T]]

object Test {
  def test: X[_] = {
    val a: A[_] = new B

    def f[T <: A[T]](x: X[T]) = x

    f(a.foo)
  }
}
```

compilation fails as: 
```scala
Test.scala:18: error: inferred type arguments [_$$2] do not conform to method f's type parameter bounds [T <: A[T]]
    f(a.foo)
    ^
```
even though it is not possible for any instance of A to fail to satisfy this bound. Explicitly specifying the existential type allows correct compilation:
```scala
object Test {
  def test: X[_] = {
    val a: A[T] forSome {type T <: A[T]} = new B

    def f[T <: A[T]](x: X[T]) = x

    f(a.foo)
  }
}
```

It seems like A[_] is naively being expanded to A[T] forSome {type T} instead of respecting the bound declared in A. Minor, but unexpected.
What you write corresponds to what is stated in the Scala specification (section "Placeholder Syntax for Existential Types").

The syntax {{A[_]}} is equivalent to {{A[T] forsome { type T >: scala.Nothing <: scala.Any }}}. When you explicitly specify {{ val a:A[_] }} you are telling the compiler to assume that that one is the type of {{a}}.

You can just write ` val a = new B ` instead, and type inference will give you the specific type you are looking for.
```scala
The syntax A[_] is equivalent to A[T] forsome { type T >: scala.Nothing <: scala.Any }.
```

In this case, shouldn't the declaration 
```scala
val a: A[_]
```
be a type error?
