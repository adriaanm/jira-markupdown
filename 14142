When pressing Ctrl+Shift+T or using content assist eclipse doesn't seem to see the scala files within the same project if they do not have an open editor somewhere. I think that this is because ScalaStructureBuilder etc. is only run on open files and the ScalaCompilationUnits must be being destroyed when the editor on them is closed.

It does seem to work ok if they have an open editor somewhere. I am not exactly sure how the build process works within a project so I think that a solution might be to run a build on the project yielding the ScalaCompilationUnits ~~~~or~~~~ use the .class files in the bin folder for the project. Research needs to be done to figure out how this works for java files. My hunch is that for .java files it is cached somewhere in the .metadata of the workspace so that when a workspace is opened all the files for java don't need to be recomputed. I will try doing a -clean open on a workspace with a lot of java files with a break point laid down in JavaElement and see if the breakpoint triggers. 

alternatively eclipse might be using the bin folder, however I find this somewhat unlikely since if this was the behaviour then it should work for .scala files after they make the jump to .class files, which is currently does not.
