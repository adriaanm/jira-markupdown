https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9632 and https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9682 stand as examples of why the JarFile API is really really buggy (especially on Windows),

Java 7 introduced a new API for dealing with zips/jars http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/io/fsp/zipfilesystemprovider.html which is also much higher performance.

It would be good if scala 2.12 could make use of these NIO APIs, since the target platform has shifted to Java 8.
