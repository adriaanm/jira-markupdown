If we have two projects _A_ and _B_ and _A_ depends on _B_ (we have added _B_ as a required project to _A_ 's build path) when we update _B_ (by adding classes, methods etc) those updates are not available to _A_ unless we do a clean & build for _A_.

I am using eclipse 3.5.1 and sdt 2.8.0.r19367-b20091102034447
