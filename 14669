If we have two projects *A* and *B* and *A* depends on *B* (we have added *B* as a required project to *A* 's build path) when we update *B* (by adding classes, methods etc) those updates are not available to *A* unless we do a clean & build for *A*.

I am using eclipse 3.5.1 and sdt 2.8.0.r19367-b20091102034447
