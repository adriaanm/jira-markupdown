Suggestions:

1. Would it be useful to have have a key binding <Esc> in order to delete the characters entered so far?

2. Would it be useful to have the key binding <Ctrl-<Backspace>> to delete word-wise the characters entered so far?

3. Would it be useful to have the key bindings <Ctrl-<Arrow right>> and <Ctrl-<Arrow left>> to move word-wise back and forth?
Some of those suggestions works for me (in Ubuntu Linux).

<Esc-<Backspace>> or <ctrl-w>

Works for me.

These common keybindings work too:

{code}
<ctrl-a> - jump to the beginning of line
<ctrl-e> - jump to the end of line
<ctrl-k> - kill rest of the line
<ctrl-d> - delete next char
{code}


Attached is a patch to add a `:shortcuts` command to the REPL.  It reads the default bindings file from the `jline.Terminal` for the current reader and prints the comments.  It isn't ideal, but it seemed like the best option.  Because it uses JLine's API, it should be cross-platform, although I haven't tested it.

The patch also modifies the REPL to resolve the ambiguity when one command is a substring of another by selecting the exact match if there is one.  Alternatively, `:shorctuts` could be renamed `:keybindings` or something else that doesn't conflict with `:sh`.

{code}
scala> :help
...
:shortcuts     print JLine shortcuts
...

scala> :short
Keybinding mapping for JLine. The format is:
[key code]: [logical operation]
CTRL-B: move to the previous character
CTRL-G: move to the previous word
CTRL-F: move to the next character
CTRL-A: move to the beginning of the line
CTRL-D: close out the input stream
CTRL-E: move the cursor to the end of the line
BACKSPACE, CTRL-H: delete the previous character
8 is the ASCII code for backspace and therefor
deleting the previous character
TAB, CTRL-I: signal that console completion should be attempted
CTRL-J, CTRL-M: newline
CTRL-K: erase the current line
ENTER: newline
CTRL-L: clear screen
CTRL-N: scroll to the next element in the history buffer
CTRL-P: scroll to the previous element in the history buffer
CTRL-R: redraw the current line
CTRL-U: delete all the characters before the cursor position
CTRL-V: paste the contents of the clipboard (useful for Windows terminal)
CTRL-W: delete the word directly before the cursor
DELETE, CTRL-?: delete the previous character
127 is the ASCII code for delete
{code}
(In r24146) Added a :keybindings command to the repl which shows what
each ctrl- key does.  Thanks to mark harrah for the patch even
though I wrote it afresh.  Would be interested to know if it
outputs anything remotely sensible on platforms which aren't
OSX.  Closes SI-3245, no review.
