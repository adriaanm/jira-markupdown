This fix is in Par-Test, to try java.home after $JAVA_HOME fails.

If my JAVA_HOME is JRE 6 (because java on my Linux is v6, even though javac is v7), then running under v7 should not fail (when we know perfectly well what java.home is).

However, if JAVA_HOME is a JDK 6, we don't bother probing every tools.jar to see if it is one we'd care to associate with.  Someone who does that knows what he or she is doing (unlike me, see above).

The other untried unheuristic is to use the location of the command-line javac (as above) to locate the JDK. (Come to think of it.)
