The following code:
{code}
object Test {
  def fn[@specialized T, @specialized U](t : T => Int, u : U => Int) : T = null.asInstanceOf[T]
}
{code}
gives the compiler error:
{code}
src\stream\Test.scala:4: error: double definition:
method fn$$mDc$$sp:(t: (Double) => Int,u: (Double) => Int)Double and
method fn$$mDc$$sp:(t: (Double) => Int,u: (Float) => Int)Double at line 4
have same type after erasure: (t: Function1,u: Function1)Double
  def fn[@specialized T, @specialized U](t : T => Int, u : U => Int) : T = null.asInstanceOf[T]
      ^
one error found
{code}
It compiles fine if the return type is not parametric or the second type parameter is removed.

Tested with Scala compiler version 2.8.0.r21907-b20100512020118.
(In r21933) Closes SI-3433. Unused specialized type parameters on methods are ignored. No review.
I don't understand this resolution. The error occurs even if the type parameter is used in the method body. For example:
{code}
  def fn[@specialized T, @specialized U](t : T => U, u : U => T, v : T) : T = u(t(v))
{code}

Sorry, I have to get this straight. :) The SID says that a method is specialized when its type contains *at least* one (not all) specialized naked type parameter. To me that indicates that my second example should have compiled correctly as T is naked.

Things are very confusing IMHO:
{code}
  // One non-naked type parameter, works fine
  def fn1[@specialized T](t : T => Int) : Int = 1

  // Two naked type parameters, works fine
  def fn2[@specialized T, @specialized U](fn1 : T => Int, fn2 : U => T, t : T, u : U) : Int = 1

  // Two type parameters, one naked, doesn't work
  def fn3[@specialized T, @specialized U](fn1 : T => Int, fn2 : U => T, u : U) : Int = 1

  // Same as fn3 except T is only specialized for Int, works fine
  def fn4[@specialized(Int) T, @specialized U](fn1 : T => Int, fn2 : U => T, u : U) : Int = 1
{code}
Clearly something is not right here.
I want to get this straight as well, but you seem to prefer talking 'in private' in the footnotes of a ticket, instead of using the wisdom of other people on the scala mailing lists :)

Unfortunately, I don't get what you mean by 'works' and 'doesn't work'. None of the examples crash; some of them issue warnings, but using your example, 'works' does not mean 'no warning'. Moreover, there are no warnings for your second example. So I will try to explain what happens, hoping I am clearer this time.

Here's the output of running (trunk) scalac on your examples:
{code}
doubledef.scala:5: warning: type T is unused or used in non-specializable positions.
  def fn1[@specialized T](t : T => Int) : Int = 1
      ^
doubledef.scala:11: warning: type T is unused or used in non-specializable positions.
  def fn3[@specialized T, @specialized U](fn1 : T => Int, fn2 : U => T, u : U) : Int = 1
      ^
doubledef.scala:14: warning: type T is unused or used in non-specializable positions.
  def fn4[@specialized(Int) T, @specialized U](fn1 : T => Int, fn2 : U => T, u : U) : Int = 1
      ^
three warnings found
{code}
When a warning is issued, the compiler strips `@specialized` from the unused type parameters, and tries to specialize again. So, if you want, the SID is correct in saying 'specialized versions are created when at least one parameter is specialized'. For example, `fn4` generates the following definitions (notice partial specialization on type U):

{code}
    <specialized> def fn4$$mVc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Unit) => T, u: Unit): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mZc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Boolean) => T, u: Boolean): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mBc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Byte) => T, u: Byte): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mSc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Short) => T, u: Short): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mCc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Char) => T, u: Char): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mIc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Int) => T, u: Int): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mLc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Long) => T, u: Long): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mFc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Float) => T, u: Float): Int = 1;
    <specialized> def fn4$$mDc$$sp[T >: Nothing <: Any](fn1: (T) => Int, fn2: (Double) => T, u: Double): Int = 1
{code}

I agree that it's not intuitive/too restrictive to not specialize when a `@specialized` type parameter is used at a specialized position in a type constructor (in this case, `Function1`), and we plan to change that, but it's not yet implemented.

What am I missing?
