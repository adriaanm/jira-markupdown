A workaround: turn the Block-that-was-in-constructor-argument-position (say, "Block-B") into "{ val dummy = Block-B; dummy }" and compilation goes fine:

{noformat}
class Foo(a: Any);

class IP extends Foo( {
    val dummy = {
       def poorMansMH1 = ""
       object X {
         poorMansMH1
       }
     }

    dummy
  }
)
{noformat}
