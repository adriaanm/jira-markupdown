Well, hmm. I'd be wary of heuristics here as the results could vary a lot depending on the environment. And, the more moving parts, the more potential for error. I'd suggest the simplest, most robust possible fix for 2.10.x, namely the fold, and then leave the door open for later refinement in 2.11, on a separate ticket. But I can see it's debatable.

I would argue that the performance of `Vector.++` is only likely to be a performance bottleneck if it is called repeatedly on the same Vector; that typically concatenation proceeds left-to-right; and that under those conditions, `big ++ small` is the main case and `small ++ big` is an edge case; it's the former that will dominate performance in typical use. Finally, if anyone is really harmed by the constant-factor slowdown in the `small ++ big` case, they can always use VectorBuilder themselves and do it their way.
