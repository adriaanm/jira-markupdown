```scala
trait A { 
  def foo: Int
  def bar: Int
}
case class B( foo: Int )( bar: Int ) extends A 
```

fails with compiler error: "class B needs to be abstract, since method bar in trait A of type => Int is not defined"

Explicitly adding a 'val' for the 'bar' field makes the code compilable:

```scala
case class B( foo: Int )( val bar: Int ) extends A 
```

Not sure if this is by design. I discovered this when trying to store the element type of an array into a case class using a secondary parameter list with an implicit ClassManifest[T]. Having automatic field generation for the secondary parameter list seems to be useful for such cases. 
As designed.

See #5009, a bug related to this behaviour, for more background.

BTW, It's best to ask on the mailing list if you're not sure whether something is a bug.
