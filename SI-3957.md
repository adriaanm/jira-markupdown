It is possible for a `Double` and a `Float` to be equal but have different hash
codes:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.r23230-b20101012020216 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_21).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> 1.5 == 1.5f
res0: Boolean = true

scala> (1.5).##
res1: Int = 1073217536

scala> (1.5f).##
res2: Int = 1069547520
```

If I understand the rules correctly, Scala requires two values (even primitives)
that are equal to have the same hash code.

I'm guessing that you could fix that by altering this code in `ScalaRunTime`:

```scala
  @inline def hash(dv: Double): Int = {
    val iv = dv.toInt
    if (iv == dv) return iv
    
    val lv = dv.toLong
    if (lv == dv) return lv.hashCode
    else dv.hashCode
  }
```

to this:

```scala
  @inline def hash(dv: Double): Int = {
    val iv = dv.toInt
    if (iv == dv) return iv
    
    val lv = dv.toLong
    if (lv == dv) return lv.hashCode

    val fv = dv.toFloat
    if (fv == dv) fv.hashCode else dv.hashCode
  }
```

and that the additional overhead is irrelevant (hashing floating point values
is perverse to begin with).
(In r23679) Fixes an inconsistency in primitive hashcode calculation.
I did have a test trying to spot exactly this situation, which
says something about either me or about testing or about
me and testing.  Closes #3957, no review.
