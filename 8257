I've found example very similar to Option example above, but I think even simpler. This was without realizing there was such ticket. I'm adding this as an example as suggested on mailing list.

{code}
class Wrapper(val value: Int) extends AnyVal
abstract class Test { def check(the: Wrapper): Boolean }
new Test { def check(the: Wrapper) = true }
{code}
{code}
error: bridge generated for member method check: (the: Wrapper)Boolean in anonymous class $anon
which overrides method check: (the: Wrapper)Boolean in class Test
clashes with definition of the member itself;
both have erased type (the: Int)Boolean
              new Test { def check(the: Wrapper) = true }
                             ^
{code}
