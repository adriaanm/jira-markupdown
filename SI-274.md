The interpreter does not print out symbol variable names correctly:
{code}
scala> val :-> = "hi!"
$$colon$$minus$$greater: java.lang.String = hi!
{code}
I think it should print the decoded variable name crrectly:
{code}
scala> val :-> = "hi!"
:->: java.lang.String = hi!
{code}
Ideally it would even add a space in this case:
{code}
scala> val :-> = "hi!"
:-> : java.lang.String = hi!
{code}

It looks like it will require something more than a smarter printer, as 2.6.1-RC-1 seems to be okay with the following input:

  {code}
scala> val $$colon$$minus$$greater = 3;
$$colon$$minus$$greater : scala.Int = 3
{code}

So perhaps the thing to do is to add a new "real name" property somewhere to variables (if it doesn't already exist).
