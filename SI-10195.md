The smallest example I was able to distill involves a type lambda:

{code:scala}
sealed trait Foo[F[_]]
case class Bar[F[_]]() extends Foo[F]

object Test {

  val foo: Foo[({ type Out[X] = String })#Out] = ???

  foo match {
    case Bar() => // error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type
                  //  found   : Bar[F]
                  //  required: Foo[[X]String]
  }
}
{code}

It is reproducible also without type lambdas, but the example is slightly more involved (some simpler cases do work):

{code:scala}
sealed trait Foo[F[_]]
case class Bar[F[_]]() extends Foo[F]

trait TC[A, B] {
  type F[X] = B
}

object TC {
  implicit val intInstance: TC[Int, String] =
    new TC[Int, String] {}

  implicit class Ops[A, B](a: A)(implicit val tc: TC[A, B]) {
    def getFoo: Foo[tc.F] = ???
  }

  1.getFoo match {
    case Bar() => // error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type
                  //  found   : Bar[F]
                  //  required: Foo[[X]String]
  }
}
{code}

In both cases, it seems it got the shape of type arguments right, but doesn't unify F[_] with [X]String.
