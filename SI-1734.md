Sometimes between r16665 and r16922 separate compilation broke. It has to do with traits and private fields, but I don't have a small example. I have the impression it can be easily reproduced while working with the trunk compiler.

It happens all the time. For instance, recompile 'Types.scala' (no change required) and then run the resulting compiler:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AbstractMethodError: scala.tools.nsc.Main$$compiler$$3$$.scala$$tools$$nsc$$symtab$$Types$$_setter_$$scala$$tools$$nsc$$symtab$$Types$$$$emptySymMap_$$eq(Lscala/collection/immutable/Map;)V
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$class.$$init$$(Types.scala:2587)
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.SymbolTable.<init>(SymbolTable.scala:12)
	at scala.tools.nsc.Global.<init>(Global.scala:34)
	at scala.tools.nsc.Main$$compiler$$3$$.<init>(Main.scala:57)
	at scala.tools.nsc.Main$$.compiler$$2(Main.scala:57)
	at scala.tools.nsc.Main$$.process(Main.scala:72)
	at scala.tools.nsc.Main$$.main(Main.scala:87)
	at scala.tools.nsc.Main.main(Main.scala)
```

This seriously reduces the usefulness of the Eclipse plugin.

Revision 16665 (when I branched for scala-specialized) does not have this issue.
I can reproduce what you're seeing with those steps, but all I infer from that is an illustration of binary incompatibility across different scala versions (which I see all the time) which I would not characterize as "separate compilation broken".  Yes, if I use a recent scalac to compile Types it won't work with the older code, but it works if I compile it separately with build/quick/bin/scalac, which is as much as I have come to expect.  Am I missing something?

I know for sure my fix to #1535 broke binary compatibility - that's too recent to be the issue here, but it's an example of why I don't see this as unexpected.
