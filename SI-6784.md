{{import scala.swing._}} gives you {{implicitConversions}} and {{reflectiveCalls}} whether you want them or not.  Perhaps the library is unusable without {{reflectiveCalls}}--I'm not sure.  But isn't {{implicitConversions}} at least a mistake?  If you don't want conversions, it's annoying; and if you do, it's also annoying because you get a conflict between {{language.implicitConversions}} and {{swing.implicitConversions}} (if you have both).
It looks like it was meant as an implementation detail of the package, rather than part of the outward facing API.

Oops. I assume they would cause problems even if they were private[swing], because of #3160. Which doesn't really explain why I didn't manage that much. It is with a heavy heart that I do this, but honor demands that I hand in my resignation as "fix all the warnings" guy.
