When comparing two values of type `Unit` with `==` the compiler warns that said comparison will always yield `true`. However, this is not the case when exactly one of the arguments is `null`:
```
scala> null.asInstanceOf[Unit] == {}
<console>:8: warning: comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true
              null.asInstanceOf[Unit] == {}
                                      ^
res0: Boolean = false
```
