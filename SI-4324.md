E.g. the title of the `MouseClicked` doc shows

`case class MouseClicked (source: Component, point: Point, modifiers: Modifiers, clicks: Int, triggersPopup: Boolean, peer: MouseEvent)`

even though `peer` is actually in a separate argument list. Which is unhelpful since it looks like this title is supposed to show the form of `unapply`.
Test case:
```scala
case class M(i: Int)(s: String) {
  def f(i1: Int)(s1: String) = ()
}
```

The only broken signature is the one on the top of the page (case class M(i: Int, s: String) extends Product with Serializable). 
Seems related to html generation.
Fixed in [8779ade6](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/8779ade6f57ef15a04babf9715bc7ca4cbbdc425).
