It seems that in order to use a (compiled) Regex instance to split a string, you have to call java.util.regex.Pattern.split, that's wrapped inside Regex:

{code}
scala> val wSplit = "[ \"',./-]+".r
wSplit: scala.util.matching.Regex = [ "',./-]+

scala> wSplit.pattern.split("Split me-into words")
res0: Array[java.lang.String] = Array(Split, me, into, words)
{code}

I'd like to suggest to either add a split method directly to Regex, or to overload !RichString's split method to accept a Regex instance (and not only a String or Char).  (Following the above example, that would mean making "Split me".split(wSplit) possible).

I guess it would merely involve adding something like

{code}
def split(s: String): Array[String] = pattern.split(s)
{code}
to Regexp and/or

{code}
def split(r: Regexp) : Array[String] = r.pattern.split(self)
{code}
to !RichString.

(I know it's only a very marginal improvement, but I think it would be nice to have, for instance when writing small text processing scripts.)
