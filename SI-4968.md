Once again I'm frustrated with the mkString function in the library.

The issue is that that three-parameter version could be great but is in fact almost completely pointless.  All it does is this:

`noformat`
mkString(begin: String, sep: String, end: String) = begin + mkString(sep) + end
`noformat`

When I need to **unconditionally** add something before and/or after a string, I can just use the + operator.  It doesn't get any easier than that, and that's the way people unconditionally concatenate strings in Java and Scala both.  I don't even save any typing with mkString since it's not any shorter than the corresponding expression using +:

`noformat`
foo.mkString("start","sep","end")
"start"+foo.mkString("sep")+"end"
`noformat`

What I most often find myself wanting to do is something like this:

`noformat`
val sql = "select * from table" + conditions.mkString(" where", "and", "")
`noformat`

Or this:

`noformat`
val path = "/a/b/c" + pathComponents.mkString("/", "/", "")
`noformat`

In other words, I want to only add the begin and end part if the collection is not empty.  Having mkString work this way would be much more useful.
Exact duplicate of #3591, which you opened and which was closed as wontfix.
Yes--I entered a new issue in order to inspire further discussion.

Why can't there be a four-argument version, in which the fourth argument is the representation of the empty collection?  That would both serve my needs and also retain the semantics of the existing function.  It would be a trivial implementation:

def mkString(begin: String, sep: String, end: String, empty: String) = if (isEmpty) empty else mkString(begin, sep, end)

Please don't open tickets to "inspire discussion." Discussion is for mailing lists.  Opening new tickets which have already been classified as wontfix only serves to fritter away my time.
