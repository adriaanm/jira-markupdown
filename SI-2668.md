Given following example:
```scala
object T {
  trait Show[-A] {
    def show(a: A): List[Char]
  }

  sealed trait MA[M[_], A] {
    val v: A
  }

  implicit def ShowMA[A](a: Show[A]): MA[Show, A] = error("TODO")

  var a: Show[Int] = null

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val x = ShowMA(a).v
    val y: Nothing = x
  }
}
```
Why it won't compile?
According to local type inference we see that Nothing for A is optimal, because Show[Int] <: Show[Nothing].
Might I suggest you ask questions like this on the mailing list first? There you have literally thousands of people that read your questions, here I'd be surprised if there's more than a dozen.

Type inference avoids inferring Nothing whenever possible, since it usually does not produce interesting results.
Note that "Nothing for A is optimal, because Show[Int] <: Show[Nothing]." is backwards: why would you want to infer a type that includes more values than needed for the program to type check? (That's a rhetorical question.)

The constraint we're solving is A <: Int, since Show[Int] <: Show[A] for the call to ShowMA to be well-typed. Thus, the most precise type we can pick for A is Int, since A is in a *covariant* position in the method type of ShowMA. (On the other hand, if we would simply pick Nothing, type inference could be much faster.)
