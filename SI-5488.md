So, while working on #3575 I noticed that AnyRef specialization didn't seem to be working. I created a simple test of AnyRef specialization, noted the failure with master, then tried compiling an example with Scala 2.9.1 and it worked.

Here's the program:

```scala
class C[@specialized(Int, AnyRef) A](v:A)                                                                                   
                                                                                                                            
object Test {                                                                                                               
  def main(args:Array[String]) {                                                                                            
    println(new C(123).getClass.getName)                                                                                    
    println(new C("abc").getClass.getName)                                                                                  
  }                                                                                                                         
}
```

The output on 2.9.1 is:

```scala
C$mcI$sp
C$mcT$sp
```

Whereas on master it is:

```scala
C$mcI$sp
C
```

I know that there was a change recently from using the (totally arbitrary) T to the (Java standard) L for referring to Object/AnyRef, as well as other AnyRef bugfixes. I'm currently trying to do a bisect to figure out when this example stopped working, but haven't figured it out yet.
I can confirm that this code worked as of commit a2ce52f83, with the following output:

```scala
C$mcI$sp
C$mcT$sp
```

So this bug was introduced after that point.
Wait, what's the point of specializing a single type parameter on AnyRef?

If I make it realistic, it crashes 2.9, but works a little bit in trunk.
```scala

class C[@specialized(Int, AnyRef) A, @specialized(Int, AnyRef) B](v:A, w:B)                                                                                  
                                                                                                                            
object Test {                                                                                                               
  def main(args:Array[String]) {                                                                                            
    println(new C(123, 123).getClass.getName)                                                                                    
    println(new C("abc", 123).getClass.getName)                                                                                  
    println(new C(123, "abc").getClass.getName)                                                                                  
    println(new C("abc", "abc").getClass.getName)
  }                                                                                                                         
}
```
```

Every nontrivial thing I try crashes 2.9, no wonder I wasn't setting the bar too high.

Here's a nice realistic one.
```scala

class C[@specialized(Int, AnyRef) A, @specialized(Int, AnyRef) B, @specialized(Int, AnyRef) C](f: (A, B) => C)

object Test {
  def main(args:Array[String]) {
    def show(x: Any) = println(x.getClass.getName)
    
    show(new C((x: Int, y: Int) => 1))
    show(new C((x: Int, y: Int) => "abc"))
    show(new C((x: Int, y: AnyRef) => 1))
    show(new C((x: Int, y: AnyRef) => "abc"))
    show(new C((x: AnyRef, y: Int) => 1))
    show(new C((x: AnyRef, y: Int) => "abc"))
    show(new C((x: AnyRef, y: AnyRef) => 1))
    show(new C((x: AnyRef, y: AnyRef) => "abc"))
  }
}
```
Only works for III.
```scala

C$mcIII$sp
C
C
C
C
C
C
C
```
If I create LL/LLL/etc specializations, the compiler crashes during mixin finding duplicate members.  I don't think it makes any sense to create L specializations but not LL, LLL, etc. so the upshot is that your test case still behaves the same even though this is fixed.  Mine on the other hand prints
```
C0$mcIII$sp
C0$mcIIL$sp
C0$mcILI$sp
C0$mcILL$sp
C0$mcLII$sp
C0$mcLIL$sp
C0$mcLLI$sp
C0
```
If there is sufficient motivation we can look into whether it makes sense to generate those all-AnyRef specializations, but I have no more time for this right now.
