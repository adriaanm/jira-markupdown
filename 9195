Ah, OK! It's about not changing the parser.

Still, I'm under the impression that defining C should probably be allowed by default, so this wouldn't work:
```scala
trait B extends A[B]       -->    trait B { type X = B }
trait B extends A[_ <: B]  -->    trait B { type X <: B } //or trait B { type X = _ <: B }, which seems the same
```
even though it's nicer

and we'd need *something* like this:
```scala
trait B extends A[=B]      -->    trait B { type X = B }
trait B extends A[B]       -->    trait B { type X <: B }
```

(Not enthusiast about the = syntax, but I am sure that picking some syntax is easier than getting soundness).
