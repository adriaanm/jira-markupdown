From UIElement.scala
```scala
def preferredSize_=(x : Dimension) : Unit

@deprecated("Use implicit conversion from Swing object instead")
def preferredSize_=(xy : Tuple2[scala.Int, scala.Int]) : Unit
```
If we write for instance
```scala
prefferedSize = (100, 100)
```
we get a warning about deprecated method. It says we need to use the implicit convertion. But we can't. For applying an implicit conversion there must be no method with Tuple[Int, Int] parameter. Only in this case scala-compiler would use "pair2Dimension" as implicit. But we have the method (marked as deprecated).

This way we can't use overloaded method with Tuple and we can't use the implicit conversion for 'Dimension' one. 

This is the same in many places of swing scala-library where methods with Tuple parameter are marked as deprecated.
(In r21810) Fixed #3358. Added explicit expected types to cachedWrapper calls, deprecated explicit resizing of UIElements.
