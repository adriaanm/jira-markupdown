The same object d below has different scala hash code
when it is seen as static type Double and when it is seen as static type Any .

```scala
def testHashHash {
  val d = (BigInt(1) << 64).toDouble
  val a: Any = d
  println("d.hashCode="+d.hashCode)
  println("d.##="+d.##)
  println("a.##="+a.##)
  assert(d.## == a.##)
}
```

This is because BoxesRunTime.hashFromDouble(java.lang.Double n) and ScalaRunTime.hash(dv: Double) don't match.

Minimized further:

```
scala> val d = (BigInt(1) << 64).toDouble
d: Double = 1.8446744073709552E19

scala> val a: Any = d
a: Any = 1.8446744073709552E19

scala> scala.Double.box(d).hashCode()
res0: Int = 1139802112

scala> scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.hash(d)
res1: Int = 1602224128

scala> scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.hash(a)
res2: Int = 1139802112
```


Actually, `a` and `d` have the same `hashCode`. It is `##` which returns different results than `hashCode` for boxed numeric types (and for `null`) as documented.

```scala
scala> val d = (BigInt(1) << 64).toDouble
d: Double = 1.8446744073709552E19

scala> val a: Any = d
a: Any = 1.8446744073709552E19

scala> d.hashCode
res22: Int = 1139802112

scala> a.hashCode
res23: Int = 1139802112
```

So if this behavior is changed, do not forget to update the docs of `##` as well.
```
## isn't supposed to give different answers based on the static type of the argument.
That (x: Any).## != (x: Foo).## is definitely a bug.  This is already recognized in the doc for ##.
"if two value type instances compare as true, then ## will produce the same hash value for each of them."
```
`runtime.BoxesRunTime.hashFromDouble(d)` still returns the wrong value. Should that also be fixed, or is this method no longer used anywhere (in the context of `##`)?
I claim that `hashFromDouble` should also check whether the argument can be represented correctly within a float and then return that hashCode.
```scala
scala> runtime.BoxesRunTime.hashFromNumber(d)
res16: Int = 1139802112

scala> runtime.BoxesRunTime.hashFromNumber(d.toFloat)
res17: Int = 1602224128

scala> d == d.toFloat
res18: Boolean = true
```
