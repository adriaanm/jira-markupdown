Hi,


when I format code I'd it to produce something like:
{code}
def a:Int = {....
}

override def b:String = {....
}

def c:BigInt = { ....
}
{code}

instead it does something like:

{code}
def a:Int = {....
}

override def b:String = {....
                }

                def c:BigInt = { ....
                }
{code}
it seems that the closing brace is placed on the same tab stop as the 'def' and any following 'def' on the same tabstop as the last closing brace. Shouldn't override count as the start of the definition in this case?
