Lately I've had several problems with Java code in Scala projects. There seems to be several problems relating to Java code seeing Scala code. Using nightly 2.8.0.r19784-b20091123020210, I coded the following on a new Scala project:

Foo.scala:
{code}
object Foo {
    def hello = println("Hello world")
}
{code}

Bar.java:
{code}
public class Bar {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Foo.hello(); // "Foo cannot be resolved"
    }
}
{code}

I've seen other similar issues, but this is the only one I have time to provide a test case for.
