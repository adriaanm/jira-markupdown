I +/- implemented this (via a macro!) [here|https://github.com/paulp/psply/blob/master/src/main/scala/PatternMacros.scala]. It's tricky because the parser generates the wrong tree if you provide type arguments in a constructor pattern - you get an AppliedTypeTree instead of TypeApply, so it must be entirely thrown out and rebuilt.
