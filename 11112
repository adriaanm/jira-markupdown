If I had to guess, I would start from [Improved BitSet implementations](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2d0f82898dc6e3998db425dbab571ba297deda41).

I hit this problem in 2.11.7, and can confirm it in 2.10.1, 2.11.0, 2.12.0-M2 as well. No problem in 2.9.3 (which does not include the aforementioned commit). This is just a guess.
