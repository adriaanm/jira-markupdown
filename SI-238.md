Anonymous functions with by-value parameters can be defined as types:
{code}
val f: (=>int)=>int = null
{code}

But not as values:
{code}
((a: =>int) => 4)
{code}
{code}
identifier expected but '=>' found.
  ((a: =>int) => 4)
       ^
{code}

It's not so pretty, but this works:

{code}
scala> (a => 0): ((=> Int) => Int)
res5: => Int => Int = <function1>

scala> res5(sys.error(""))
res6: Int = 0
{code}
