I stumbled on the same bug (I guess) and added a [simplified sample project at github](https://github.com/michael72/scalaAnnotationBug). I really would like to be able to check for special annotations in classes in macro code.
The above workarounds applied in the macro (also the one mentioned in 7424) do not seem to work.
