The kind of position assigned to the qualifier `d` in the below example is incorrect, and this result in incorrect hyperlinking and semantic highlighting in the Scala IDE

{code}
object X {
      val d = new D
      d(10) // <-- hyperlinking on `d` should jump to the declaration just above
    }

import language.dynamics
class D extends Dynamic {
  def applyDynamic(name: String)(value: Any) = ???
}
{code}

Hyperlinking on `d` should resolve to the declaration of `d`, not the `applyDynamic` method in class `D`.
This ticket and https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8125 are very much related.
