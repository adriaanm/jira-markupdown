Issue arises whenever (a) a class parameter in a derived class uses the same
symbol as a field or function in a base class and (b) that base class symbol
is subsequently accessed in the derived class. The derived class parameter
causes the compiler to auto-generate a field of the same name that shadows 
the base class symbol. Any reference to that symbol in the Derived class, 
intended to refer to the base class field, then inadvertently (a) causes 
duplicate definition of the field and (b) unexpectedly (but correctly) refers 
to the auto-generated field in the derived class.

Code example:

    class Base( val x : String )
    class Derived( x : String ) extends Base( x ) { override def toString = x }

Since the 'Base' class has 'val' to generate the field and the derived class
does not, the developer clearly intends to use the 'Derived' 'x' only for
pass-through to Base, and therefore expects the reference in 'toString' to
yield the Base value. Instead, the reference in 'toString' causes the compiler
to automatically generate a field 'Derived.x' that shadows the 'Base.x' field,
resulting in an error. The compiler behaves correctly, but the result is a 
programming error.

Usage scenario (with var fields for clearer illustration of the risks):

    class Base( var x : Int ) { def increment() { x = x + 1 } }
    class Derived( x : Int ) extends Base( x ) { override def toString = x.toString }

    val derived = new Derived( 1 )
    println( derived.toString )     // yields '1', as expected
    derived.increment()
    println( derived.toString )     // still '1', probably unexpected

Since this issue arises whenever anyone uses the default way to initialize
base class fields from a derived class in Scala, the scenario would appear to
be extremely common and result in lots of programming errors (easily fixed, 
but still) for newer users.
 
An easy work-around for this issue exists (use differing names for the derived
class parameter, like '_x', 'theX', 'initialX', etc.), but this introduces 
unwanted extra symbols. 


Solution A (Minimal): issue a warning whenever the compiler infers that a 
class parameter requires an auto-generated field in a derived class that 
would shadow a symbol already defined in a base class.

Solution B: the work-around, still required with Solution A, is to come up
with a new symbol name each time one initializes a base class field. This 
scenario comes up all the time and polluting the namespace with workaround 
field names like '_x' and 'theX' seems undesirable. Instead, it might be nice 
to have a way to suppress automatic field generation if the developer 
determines that the derived class symbols would otherwise end up hiding a base 
class symbol (e.g., following the warning of Solution A). Maybe a useful
addition to Scala would be a modifier like 'noval' (or 'passthrough' or 
'temp', or whatever - in addition to 'val' and 'var'), like this:

    class Base( var x : Int ) { def increment() { x = x + 1 } }
    class Derived( noval x : Int ) extends Base( x ) { override def toString = x.toString }

    val derived = new Derived( 1 )
    println( derived.toString )     // yields '1', as expected
    derived.increment()
    println( derived.toString )     // still '2', as expected

BTW, this ticket was posted in response to a suggestion by @jsuereth in the related thread on StackOverflow.com, which can be found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6515931/idiomatic-scala-way-to-deal-with-base-vs-derived-class-field-names 
It's not helpful that your first code sample doesn't generate a field in Derived.  There is a very serious bug here, which is related to #3194 but worse.
```scala
class A(var x: Int) {
  def increment() { x = x + 1 }
}
class B(x: Int) extends A(x) {
  def y = this.x
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = new B(100)
    x.increment()
    assert(x.x == x.y)
  }
}
```
That assertion fails.  That is very bad.  It would be bad enough if "def y = x" asserted, which is what is being reported here, and which is a problem in its own right.  (And of course it does.) But to have "this.x" silently using the initial constructor parameter in this potentially common scenario with no warning or anything is a correctness disaster.
OK, and just for completeness' sake the answer for the idiomatically correct workaround that Aaron Novstrup provided to my original question on StackOverflow (use an abstract field on the base class), modified a bit to match your example code above:

        abstract class A { var x: Int; def increment() { x+=1 } }
        class B (var x: Int) extends A { override def toString = x.toString }
        val b = new B(0)
        assert( b.x == 0 )
        b.increment()
        assert( b.x == 1 )
Fancier example for a more visceral horror show.
```scala
// In A, x and y are -1.
class A(val x: Int) {
 val y: Int = -1
}

// In B, x and y are 99 and private[this], implicitly so
// in the case of x.
class B(x: Int) extends A(-1) {
 private[this] def y: Int = 99

 // Three distinct results.
 def f = List(
   /* (99,99) */  (this.x, this.y),
   /* (-1,99) */  ((this: B).x, (this: B).y),
   /* (-1,-1) */  ((this: A).x, (this: A).y)
 )

 // The 99s tell us we are reading the private[this]
 // data of a different instance.
 def g(b: B) = List(
   /* (-1,99) */  (b.x, b.y),
   /* (-1,99) */  ((b: B).x, (b: B).y),
   /* (-1,-1) */  ((b: A).x, (b: A).y)
 )
}

object Test {
 def f(x: A)  = /* -2 */  x.x + x.y
 def g1(x: B) = /* -2 */  (x: A).x + (x: A).y
 def g2(x: B) = (x: B).x + (x: B).y
 // java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method B.y()I from
class Test$

 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
   val b = new B(99)
   b.f foreach println
   b.g(new B(99)) foreach println

   println(f(b))
   println(g1(b))
   println(g2(b))
 }
}
```
Don't panic! The only real problem I can see here is that the `private[this] def x` in `B` should not override the inherited `x` yet it does. I believe the same error is in order here as if `x` had been declared `private def x`. For `private[this] val x` (which is *far* more common) the test is not necessary because fields don't override on the JVM. That's a relief because adding the test would probably cause lots of programs to break.


(extempore in [r25875](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25875)) Warn about surprising shadowing.

It's hidden behind -Xlint and pretty specific, but makes me feel
better anyway.  References #4762, no review.
Nobody commented on runtime overhead of field duplication, which is annoying to avoid.
```scala
class Base( val x : String )
class Derived( x : String ) extends Base( x ) { override def toString = x }
```

The above code, for instance, will produce two 'x' fields in \code{Derived}, apparently. I found that variations of this code, however, will not, but I have been unable to gain control of the issue other than by trial and error.
Allowing the reading of private[this] fields in different instances is in direct violation of the spec.  If that part is wontfix, I would like to see the specification updated before the ticket is closed.
