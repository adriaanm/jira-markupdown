The synthetic synchronized method has this signature:
{code}
def synchronized [T0] (arg0: T0) : T0 
{code}
This is not logical.  If it isn't (arg0: => T0) then the method isn't likely to accomplish much.  (The implementation treats synchronized as a primitive and apparently ignores the signature.)

Also, it makes me uncomfortable that synchronized goes completely unmentioned in the spec.  If String.+ can inspire epic poems, then surely something as critical as synchronization can win a pittance.  (The ticket already exists: SI-494.)
