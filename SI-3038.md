Using Scala 2.8.0.r20828 and Java 1.6

Because the bitmask for lazy vals is shared by classes in an inheritance chain, adding a private lazy val breaks binary compatibility/separate compilation.  Consider A.scala and B.scala:

A.scala
{code}
class A {
   lazy val x = 1
}
{code}

B.scala
{code}
class B extends A {
   lazy val y = 2
}
{code}

and a test class in C.scala
{code}
object C {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val b = new B
      println( b.x )
      println( b.y )
   }
}
{code}

Compiling all files and running C prints
{code}
1
2
{code}

Change A.scala to use a private lazy val:
{code}
class A {
   lazy val x = x2
   private lazy val x2 = 1
}
{code}

Recompiling A.scala and running C prints
{code}
1
0
{code}
Any attempt to address this should also encompass SI-1573 and SI-1574.  Possibly the lowest impact would be to have a separate bitspace for private lazy vals (and yet another one for transient ones? Hello @transient private lazy good-times!)
As pointed out by Mark, the solution to this ticket can possibly fix SI-3059 as well.
This should be fairly easy now that fix for SI-3895 is in place. Note that the actual example above works now, but it reappears if you move x2 before x. Because of the inheritance such situations will happen for public/protected lazy vals but private lazy vals will use private bitmap once I fix this.
(In r23435) Added separate bitmaps for private and transient lazy vals. Closes SI-3038, SI-1573. Review by dragos.
I had to fix a couple of initialization issues that checkinit forced me to do and that weren't a problem before because the bitmap was serialized even for @transitive. For that I needed to change the setters in checkinit so that they also update the bitmap.
