thanks to minimizer and fixer!

I wish I had thought of this when I saw that _1, _2 commit.
I had this sneaky suspicion it would somehow affect this part of the pattern matcher, but couldn't put my finger on it...

I think something along the lines of your second patch would be best.
It is indeed puzzling that we get that refined type.
Maybe we should be using members rather than decls?

I'll have a look
