in trunk as of april 22 2010:

{code}
scala.swing.Window:

37  override def contents_=(c: Component) {
38	    super.contents_=(c)
39	    peer.pack() // pack also validates, which is generally required after an add
40	  }
{code}

As can be seen, 'pack()' is called when changing the content of a Window. This is generally NOT what you want. Pack() has the function to resize a window to fit its contents. It's an optional feature. It is normally NOT desired when the programmer sets the size explicitly (using size = ...). It is in general NOT desired when the window has a size set before. 

This can cause the window of the app to be suddenly resized when it sets e.g. a new mainpanel in it. E.g. a bank-app; Window resizes when the initial overview screen is installed; resizes again (!) when this is replaced by some detail screen. 

To make things worse, imagine the end-user to resize the window to it's liking, which will be undone when the content of the window changes! (caused by this 'pack()')! That would def. be regarded as a bug.

It MIGHT be a nice initial, one-time, fallback auto-behaviour in the case when the window doesn't have a size set yet, but is requested to be displayed. (The pack() call should be moved to that function then and some condition state-checking should be added to the class).[[BR]]
BUT EVEN THEN, I am not sure that there are no valid cases for wanting to display a window with a 'zero' size (if that's the default for a window). 

Hi Ingo,
you write:


{code}
The vast majority of use cases for contents_= is to set the initial contents of a window and there you want a pack or at least a validate. Changing this now would break quite some code. 
{code}
You could replace the pack() call to a revalidate() call (and perhaps a repaint(), if I remember well).
{code}

{code}
Moreover, I would consider changing the entire content of a window in the middle of an app run bad style anyways. 
{code}
Could you explain that?
To me it seems the most clean and straightforward way. In full accordance with the swing specs.

{code}
If you really want to do that, you should be able to do so with one level of indirection: add a panel and change it's contents instead of the window's contents.
{code}
and not needing borderplate work-arounds like this.
In normal Swing I can just cleanly replace the contents. (Which is supported, check the API docs).

Ofcourse I understand that you want your DSL as simple as possible, and like to get rid of an explicit pack(), which people tend to forget.
That's why I propose you could look to use pack() (and/or validate()) conditionally, not in the contents update method, but at a 'just before displaying' point.
In the other case programmers set the size of a window explicitly (by using size = ...).

I appreciate all the work that has gone in the scala Swing API. It makes swing programming a lot easier and cleaner. But this peticular pack() call hurts more than that it's helpful. 
(Oops, messed up formatting, again..)
