affects version 2.10 M7 as well.

Using the direct link (as working in 2.9.x):

```scala
./doc/scales/xml/package.html#writeTo%5bT%5d(T,Writer,Option%5bXmlVersion%5d,Option%5bCharset%5d)(SerializerFactory,SerializeableXml%5bT%5d):Option%5bThrowable%5d
```

is redirected to:

```scala
index.html#scales.xml.package
```

The direct anchor to writeTo... is, however, dropped.

Vlad has shown the new direct syntax is:

```scala
index.html#scales.xml.package@packageobject
```

which works fine in M7.

This affects all object members including package objects
