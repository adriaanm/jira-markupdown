It's well known that the following idiom should disable String-+:

{code}
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _, _}

object Test {
  new Object() +"abc"
}
{code}

Only, it doesn't anymore. You need to write:

{code}
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _, StringAdd => _, _}

object Test {
  new Object() +"abc"
}
{code}
The problem is that any2stringadd has spawned an evil twin in the form of the class StringAdd which is now an implicit class. I am not sure why StringAdd has to be an implicit class in the first place.
