JSR 308 brought annotations on type parameters such as
```java
class SomeBean {
     Optional<@Base64 String> bs;
}
```

After a quick byte-code analysis ({{javap -v ... | grep Base64}}) the following scala code does not seem to compile properly:
```scala
case class SomeScalaBean(bs: Optional[String @Base64]) 
```

This was asked on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38833827/how-to-annotate-a-type-parameter-in-scala
