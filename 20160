JSR 308 brought annotations on type parameters such as

{code:java}
class SomeBean {
     Optional<@Base64 String> bs;
}
{code}

After a quick byte-code analysis ({{javap -v ... | grep Base64}}) the following scala code does not seem to compile properly:
{code:scala}
case class SomeScalaBean(bs: Optional[String @Base64]) 
{code}
