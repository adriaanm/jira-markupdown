The following was exctrated from the Coursera Reactive class assignment:

{code}
// nodescala/package.scala
import scala.concurrent.Future

package object nodescala {
  implicit class FutureCompanionOps[T](val f: Future.type) extends AnyVal {
    def always[T](value: T): Future[T] = Promise[T].success(value).future
  }
}

// nodescala/NodeScalaSuite.scala
package nodescala

import scala.concurrent.Future

class NodeScalaSuite {
  Future.always(517) //<-- error reported
}
{code}

The reported error is: "value always is not a member of object scala.concurrent.Future"

I've managed to create a presentation compiler test that demonstrates the problem, will be pushing a patch with the failing test soon.
