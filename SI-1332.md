Defining new refined instances of an abstract case class with equal parameter values, the instances are equal, but their hashCodes are not. This seems against the spec.

scala> abstract case class C(id: String)
scala> val A1 = new C("A") {}
scala> val A2 = new C("A") {}

scala> A1 == A2
res1: Boolean = true

scala> A1.hashCode == A2.hashCode
res2: Boolean = **false**
Another example of case classes only meeting half the equals contract:
```scala
scala> case class Foo(xs: Int*)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(1,2,3) == Foo(1,2,3)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> Foo(1,2,3).hashCode == Foo(1,2,3).hashCode
res1: Boolean = false
```
Equal objects must have equal hashcodes! I think this is a serious bug.
(In r21080) Test case for case class equality.  Closes #1332.  No review.
