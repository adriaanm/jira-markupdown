Hi,

We created a DSL with Scala that uses the builder pattern. When we use it, we chain methods:

method1.method2.method1.method2...

As our DSL describes scenarios for load testing, some of these scenarios can be very large:

val scn = scenario("name").method1.method2.method1.... (up to 500 times in some cases)

The problem is that when we have a great number of methods chained, the scala compiler crashes with a StackOverflowError. This is understandable but even with 3Mo allocated for the stack and splitting the chain does not solve the problem.

To explain a bit more, when I say split the chain I mean doing something like:

val chain1 = chain.method1.method2.method1
val chain2 = ...

val scn = scenario().insertChain(chain1).insertChain(chain2)
I advise not making it infer a type from 500 method invocations deep.

val scn: WhateverTypeItIs = scenario(...)
