=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
import collection.mutable._

val x: ArrayBuffer[String] = ArrayBuffer("a", "b", "c")
val y: IndexedSeq[String] = x.view map (_ + "0")
```

This code compiles but produces a `ClassCastException` in the last line:
```scala
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.SeqViewLike$$$$anon$$3 cannot be cast to scala.collection.mutable.IndexedSeq
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
A compiler error or working code.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
Yep, [seems like](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/83d815622e3e76083496cffa9efb1e7c8fc3e5d3) the essential part which is the expected type is missing in the test.
A bit of more info: this is specific to mutable.IndexedSeq which returns a mutable.IndexedSeqView if `.view` is called. 

For some reason for this line

```scala
val y: IndexedSeq[String] = collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(1,2,3).view.map[String, IndexedSeq[String]](_ + "0")
```

this is inferred in typer:

```scala
 val y: IndexedSeq[String] = scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.apply[Int](1, 2, 3).view.map[String, IndexedSeq[String]](((x$1: Int) => x$1.+("0")))(mutable.this.IndexedSeq.canBuildFrom[String]);
```

so it is using a CanBuildFrom from IndexedSeq which isn't what usually happens with views where a call like this would fail because of a missing CBF.

<embarassing confession>I don't really understand what's going on in the collections </embarassing confession> but is it possible that mutable.IndexedSeqView is just missing the usual boilerplate for `map` et al.?
Ok, so it's a different bug now, really.   No longer class cast exception, but the CanBuildFrom's are all off.

Here's a relevant snippet with the types inferred:

```scala
scala> val x = collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(1,2,3)
x: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)

scala> x.view
res1: scala.collection.mutable.IndexedSeqView[Int,scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]] = SeqView(...)

scala> res1 map (_ + "0")
res2: scala.collection.SeqView[String,scala.collection.mutable.Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)
```


We loose the IndexedSeqView after a map, which tells me either (a) it's not overridden (likely) or (b) it's missing an appropriate CanBuildFrom.    If the answer is (a), I'll have to dig further.  This may be a limitation on IndexedSeqView that **after** a transformation operation, you shouldn't treat it as an IndexedSeq anymore.

Ok, a bit more information.   We're running a fowl of variance restrictions (and correctness) here.

(1) mutable.IndexedViewSeq  will **actually** manipulate the underlying collection at the view given. 
(2) Any mapping operation drops from mutable.IndexedSeqView to SeqView.   This in inherent in the fact that any mapping operation returns a **new collection** for mutable collections.  This is actually expected and 'ok'.  Otherwise what should the following do?

```scala
val x = collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(1,2,3)
val y = x.view map (_ + "0")
val z = y.update(0, "O NOES")
```

(3) the "indexed" part of the type implies fast indexed lookup.  That's not the case for views that have transformations.


It may be confusing to drop from an mutable.IndexSeqView to SeqView, but given the three points above,  I'm thinking we have "correct" behavior here.   

I'll try to flush out all the ClassCastExceptions and make sure you can't accidentally assign to IndexedSeq once you loose the "Indexed"-ness.

You're not just loosing the IndexedSeq-ness (remember Seq has indexed operations for slower indexing), you're **also** losing mutability of the original collection.  You can't allow the view to chain mutation back into the original.   

SO yes.  You're no longer a mutable.IndexedSeq after a map/flatMap/etc.
More related brokenness reported by Dima Golubets:

```scala
scala> Array(1, 2, 3, 4).view
res60: scala.collection.mutable.IndexedSeqView[Int,Array[Int]] = SeqView(...)
OK

scala> Array(1, 2, 3, 4).view.map{x => println(x); x}
res61: scala.collection.SeqView[Int,Array[Int]] = SeqViewM(...)
OK

scala> Array(1, 2, 3, 4).view.map{x => println(x); x}.map{x => println(x); x}
res62: Seq[Int] = SeqViewMM(...)
WTF? Why Seq?

After that point I can't call a force method. But I want to get some results so lets try:

scala> Array(1, 2, 3, 4).view.map{x => println(x); x}.map{x => println(x); x}.take(1).toList
1
1
res64: List[Int] = List(1)
OK..

scala> Array(1, 2, 3, 4).view.map{x => println(x); x}.map{x => println(x); x}.take(1).toArray
1
1
1
1
res65: Array[Int] = Array(1)
Double view evaluation!
```

Note that double view evaluation isn't forbidden by the contract, but views should perhaps be a little smarter about the choice of algorithm
Not sure whether this is a separate bug or not, but it could be related:
I'm trying to work with a string as a view. From my perspective this should return SeqView:
```scala
"abc".view.updated(0, 'A')
```
But it returns Seq, the same as in previous comment. It looks like it's missing appropriate CanBuildFrom.
```scala
Seq('a', 'b', 'c').view.updated(0, 'A')
```
works fine. 

It looks very similar to some of the code reported above, but this time it is about immutable structure.

Scala 2.11.2
I am not sure there is a simple fix of the sort that should go in for RC1.  To fix this (without exposing a bunch of other equivalent holes) I had to rewrite a lot of the views library to make it differently-consistent.  The problem is that the function given to `map` is not invertible, so you can't very well change the original values.  But it's also confusing that some methods detach you from the original collection while others do not.

I recommend punting until 2.13, @adriaanm @szeiger (at which point I may have time to get my tentative fixes in).
