BTW the test scenario that harrah provided in scala/bug#2590 works as expected in r19510, but the problem here is not that class *B* will not get recompiled when we add *A* back.

The problem in this bug is that if we have classes A and B (even in the same file) and B uses A, if we delete A and recompile (by saving the file in Eclipse) we don't see any errors in B (although the *A.class* file gets deleted from the filesystem).

As I've written in a previous comment this happen for types (class/object/trait) and not for methods (def/val/var).
