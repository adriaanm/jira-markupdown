When compiling code that contains non-exhaustive matches on case classes with multiple parameters like the test case below, the compiler uses excessive system resources. For the test case below, on my system {{scalac}} peaks to using over 2 GB of memory (when run with {{-J-Xmx4G}}) and does not finish compiling after running for 10 minutes. Adding a default case to make the match exhaustive or compiling with {{-Xno-patmat-analysis}} allows compilation to finish in reasonable time with compiler version 2.12.0, but was not necessary with version 2.11.8.

*Test case:*
{code}
case class C(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int, d: Int, e: Int, f: Int)
object C {
	def bug(c: C): Int = c match {
		case C(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) => 0
		case C(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) => 1
		case C(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) => 2
		case C(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) => 3
		case C(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) => 4
		case C(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) => 5
		case C(6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6) => 6
		case C(7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7) => 7
		case C(8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8) => 8
		case C(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9) => 9
	}
}
{code}
The difference between 2.11.8 and 2.12.0 is that we have started to treat case classes as one-case-ADTs for the purposes of the analysis. If we introduce a sealed parent type, I get a OOME in 2.11.8:

{code}
sealed trait T
case class C(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int, d: Int, e: Int, f: Int) extends T

object Test {
  def bug(c: T): Int = c match {
      case C(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) => 0
      case C(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) => 1
      case C(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2) => 2
      case C(3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) => 3
      case C(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4) => 4
      case C(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) => 5
      case C(6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6) => 6
      case C(7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7) => 7
      case C(8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8) => 8
      case C(9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9) => 9
  }
}
{code}

The bottleneck seems to be:

In which the compiler doggedly attempts to produce an exhaustive list of counter examples. Were it possible to create these  We can tell in advance that this is impractically large, the question is what to do instead in degrade to a useful counter example message.
