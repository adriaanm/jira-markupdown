At least that's the most specific explanation that I've found yet.

From https://gist.github.com/jrudolph/d5213d32d425fce0d88a:

{code}
  def run() =
    {
      @tailrec def rec(count: Long): Boolean =
        if (count == 0) true else rec(count - 1)
 
      rec(1000000L)
    } && true
{code}

Here's the original report:

Parboiled2 relies heavily on expressions like this.
