I would support making no-unicode-translation the default inside triple-quoted strings only.  Having unicode translated is handy for certain * cough * Scalaz * cough * libraries that use unicode characters.  If you want to stick a unicode CR inside your comment, that's up to you.  However, triple-quoted strings are supposed to be _literals_.  The \uABCD thing breaks that expectation spectacularly for e.g. Windows filenames which is exactly the sort of place where you want it to work.

Since Java has no string literals, there are no Java expectations to meet in this regard.

There could be a compile-time flag to turn on unicode escapes even in string literals if you really want it.  Otherwise, this is a gotcha waiting to happen for Windows users.
