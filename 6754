What is the status of this issue?

The deprecated annotation is removed in [0], and scala/bug#6571 said "closing as meta-bug â€“ the individual tickets will still be fixed if they haven't already". However, this issue still happens in Scala 2.10.5. So I am not sure it is deprecated or revived right now? Please provide the information so that we can decide continuously use it or change to third-party library, thanks.
