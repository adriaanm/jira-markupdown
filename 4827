Here it is a bit further reduced, to the point that it looks like some crazy person's stream of scala consciousness.
{code}
def f: Unit = try return finally while(true) ()
{code}
This equivalent variation does not crash.  (I'm not surprised they compile differently, but equivalent in meaning.)
{code}
def f: Unit = try {} finally while(true) ()
{code}
