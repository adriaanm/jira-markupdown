Copy&pasting what I reported to scala-internals list:

https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/pMTwrmZbPy0/discussion

I just made a discovery that in trunk's Scala library there's one use of structural type. It's being used in implementation of Iterator.span (Iterator.scala:508).

I'm pretty sure that structural type in that place is not intended and is there only because type inference inferred structural type. Given the fact that structural types are not very efficient on JVM I consider this as a bug that might affect the performance. Patch below fixes that problem.

(grek in [r25283|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25283]) Get rid of structural type in Iterator.scala

Implementation of Iterator.scala defined a structural type
by mistake. By naming a class we get rid of that structural
type.

Fixes #4791. No review.
