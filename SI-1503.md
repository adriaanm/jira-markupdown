I've added a test to pending/run/castsingleton.scala:

{code}
object Test extends Application {
  case class L();
  object N extends L();

  def empty(xs : L) : Unit = xs match {
    case x@N => println(x); println(x);
  }

  empty(L())
} 
{code}

The problem is that the compiler inserts a cast of xs to N.type, which is unsound: The pattern match will succeed for any L, because N == L(). 
After some discussion the conclusion is that the specced behaviour for this is broken.

The suggested fix is that stable identifier patterns defined behaviour will be modified so that something matches it if and only if it is equal to that stable identifier *and* is an instance of the static type of that identifier. Thus in this case L() will not match the pattern N because it is not an instance of N.type. 
Yes, shouldn't have closed the ticket.

I also thought of this approach, but I did not think you'd want to have different semantics for matching solely based on the presence/absence of a binding - that is, if I'm understanding correctly we're saying given this:
{code}
    case N => true
case x @ N => true
{code}
the first will match and the second won't, given the same scrutinee of L() from the test case.

I am assuming that is indeed what you mean - I am all for it and will implement it in the near future.
Yes, that is indeed a disadvantage. I also thought of another approach, which is cleaner, but the worry is that it might break old code: We need to work out carefully what is known about the type of a variable in a binder. The variable certainly has the pattern's expected type. And some patterns also contribute type information. The intersection of these two types would then be the type of the variable.

For instance:

val foo: List[String]

foo match {
  case n @ Nil => ... // expected type: List[String], pattern type: ?
  case c: ::[_] =>    // expected type: List[String], pattern type: ::[?]
  ...
}

In the first case, the best type for n is List[String], the expected type.
In the first case it would be List[String] with ::[?], and by some other piece
of not yet implemented type checking inference we could infer this to be equal to
::[String].

I think this would be the most logical approach. But I am not sure how many old programs would break, because some variables would get assigned weaker types than before.

Anyway, it looks more and more like there is a paper in this. Things are far from trivial. 

Noting for the record that I reverted this patch after martin reported it changed the behavior of this snippet, because Byte doesn't have the static type of Char:
{code}
val buf: Array[Byte]

def processVerbatim(i: Int, end: String): Int = {
      val END = end.charAt(0)
    
     def processCode(pre: String, i: Int): Int = {...
        buf(i) match {
          case END if startsWith(i, end) =>
            // return
}                                                                               
    
{code}
Interestingly I can't reproduce this in a simple example, but I did reproduce the behavior in verbfilterScala.scala, and I did verify that reverting the patch for this ticket restored the original matching behavior.
I don't know how this even looked fixed.
{code}
case object Foo {
  def bippy = 1
  override def equals(other: Any) = true
}

object Test extends App {
  ("": Any) match { case p @ Foo => p.bippy }
}
{code}

Just to add an example that doesn't require extending a case class or writing a constant equals:

{code}
scala> (IndexedSeq(): Any) match { case n @ Nil => n.mapConserve(x => x) }
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.immutable.Vector cannot be cast to scala.collection.immutable.List
{code}
Geez, you don't even need mapConserve. Pattern matcher will be glad to arrange the CCE for you. Full service! Very classy.

java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.immutable.Vector cannot be cast to scala.collection.immutable.Nil$

Fix originally proposed for SI-5024:  https://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commits/ticket-5024, see also SI-4577.
This only breaks programs built on a type-lie, as far as I can tell.

I've implemented Martin's alternative proposal, which calls for determining the type implied by a pattern matching a certain value. Usually, this is the pattern's type because pattern matching implies instance-of checks. 

However, Stable Identifier and Literal patterns are matched using `==`, which does not imply a type for the binder that binds the matched value. The behavior change due to this fix is that programs that used to crash with a CCE now get a weaker type instead (and no cast). They may still type check, or they may not.

`case x@Foo => x` should be changed to `case x: Foo.type => x` if type propagation is important -- NOTE that I also intend to fix SI-4577, so that matching will use `eq` for singleton types, not `==` (so that the types are not a lie).

I very much question the suggestion that this program is "built on a type lie" or that changing the inferred type from a List of Ints to Any isn't going to break anything.
{code}
object Test {
  def f(xs: Any) = xs match {
    case xs @ Nil => xs
    case _        => List[Int]()
  }
}
{code}

It is, but that's scala's bug, not theirs. The author of that method wrote it in in a perfectly obvious way, which has worked forever; it's probably the explicitly recommended way in one or more official scala things. They only ever call the method with Lists, not Vectors, which they've never heard of. It will never fail - until it is broken out from under them to fix a bug not of their making and which they could never have anticipated.

-Xstrict-inference might be a good place for this one if its too risky for broader release.

Just as a reminder, we also need to fix the regression noted in SI-5900/SI-7886 before 2.11.0-RC1. That might involve rolling back the changes of SI-7886 (unsound pattern inference). That patch actually only superfically improved the state of play.

These sort of unresolved questions suggests to me that the schedule for RC1 isn't realistic and that we need another month or so.
I was thinking -Xfuture for this one.

PS: I'm against further delays. Let's fix what we can (only) fix in 2.11.0 now, reverting where necessary. Everything else goes to 2.11.1 or 2.12. 

Is it possible for the compiler to offer more guidance in addition to the current warnings? 

For example, in doing {{case x@N => ...}}, the compiler could offer:
bq. you probably want {{case x:N.type => ...}}

Currently it just says something is dangerous buy offers no alternatives.
In 2.12.x the example in this ticket produces a non-exhaustive match warning,
