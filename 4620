Please, please rethink your decision. In some situations the need for a custom error message might not be important. In such situations the use of the filter method in for comprehensions would be a perfect fit.

In addition, I am really astonished. In general, the Scala APIs offer a wealth of methods, not all of them always being strictly necessary. The same is true for "Parser". For example there a three methods in the Parser class named ">>", "flatMap", and "into" offering the same functionality. So why not offering a filter method that would really increase the capability?
