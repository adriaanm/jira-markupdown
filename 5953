This is not a regression, just that you used '[]' instead of '()', so the expression isn't valid.

{code}
scala> :t (List(1,2,3))
List[Int]
{code}

This might instead be reclassified as a request to show compiler error messages for :t.  It is possible Paul intentionally suppressed error detail, so he can comment on that.
