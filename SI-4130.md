=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

As discussed in the thread [http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8472 sc.isLetter], the REPL will change the way commands are interpreted depending on the names of files that may happen to be present in the file system.

After some discussion during a meeting, it was concluded that giving higher priority to files can lead to results that are unexpected or needlessly frustrating for users.

Suggested alternatives are hiding this behavior under the ":power" mode, or lowering the priority so that files are considered only if nothing else of the same name is in scope.
Yeah, like I said in the thread it's not by design.  I was already fixing it.

(In r24040) The repl becomes more intense about making sure you wanted file
completion before offering it.  Closes SI-4130, no review.
