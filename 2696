Possibly depending on what you expect to work, I'm pretty sure this isn't fixed.
{code}
scala> val m = scala.collection.mutable.HashMap(Float.NaN -> "hi")
m: scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[Float,java.lang.String] = Map(NaN -> hi)

scala> m(Float.NaN)
java.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: NaN
	at scala.collection.MapLike$$class.default(MapLike.scala:191)
{code}
I don't see how it's fixable at the location where you put the nan code, or how to avoid the check in the boxesruntime equals method.  That's what I was referring to in comment SI-5.
