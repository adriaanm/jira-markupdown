The following mixture of attempting a phantom-type constraint + specialization explodes at compile time:

```scala
trait C
class Foo[@specialized(Int) T, A] {
  def bar[B >: A <: C]: T = ???
}
```

With the following exception:

```scala
error:

```

Remove any one of the type bounds makes the code succeed.  Removing the @specialize annotation also makes the code succeed.
More generally, you're not allowed to do a call such as this one:

```scala
class Foo[/*@specialized(Int) */T, A] {
  def bar[B >: A <: AnyRef]: T = throw new Exception
  
  bar[A]
}
```

since it's possible that `A` is not a subtype of `AnyRef` at all in certain contexts. So, generating a bridge `bar$mcI$sp` for `bar` will contain an expression which is not type-safe. Meaning that instead of the compiler failing, an error should be reported here.
