Double semi is especially useless, pace the original reporter.
```scala
;; looks like a walrus in certain fonts, I think
;; two eyes and cute little tusks
;; or possibly that weird spider with the beady eyes
def iam = "walrus"
```

That works if Scala doesn't adopt forever syntax, `for (;; )`. Extra space to avoid winky emoji.

I often accidentally insert `//` in my shell scripts, so it would be great if double hash were also supported. It could resolve to `this.##` if that typechecks and a line comment otherwise.
