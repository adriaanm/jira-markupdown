 SLS 5.3 says that "Members of final classes or objects are implicitly also final, so the final modifier is redundant for them." But observe the different bytecode generated below.

There's already a ticket #1458, "non-final vals on objects will not be inlined for use in case statements", but that ticket is in the context of "case", and was consolidated under #2398, which is also only about "case". But the same issue exists elsewhere.

```scala
  ~> cat S.scala                                               
object S1 {
  final val x = 3
  val y = 3
}

object S2 {
  def x = S1.x
  def y = S1.y
}
  ~> /usr/local/scala-2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease/bin/scalac S.scala
  ~> javap -classpath . -c -private S1\$$
public int y();
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	getfield	SI-24; //Field y:I
   4:	ireturn

public final int x();
  Code:
   0:	iconst_3
   1:	ireturn

  ~> javap -classpath . -c -private S2\$$
public int y();
  Code:
   0:	getstatic	SI-26; //Field S1$$.MODULE$$:LS1$$;
   3:	invokevirtual	SI-28; //Method S1$$.y:()I
   6:	ireturn

public int x();
  Code:
   0:	iconst_3
   1:	ireturn
```

Note not only is different bytecode generated in S1, but the difference is propagated to S2.

This seems odd at best, wrong at worst (given the SLS wording), and anyway I'm guessing the difference wasn't intended, based on extempore's comment in #1458: "The usage of isFinal vs. hasFlag FINAL... should be investigated throughout the compiler."
FYI to any interested: here is iulian's comment on #1456 which explains why this happens:

Indeed, constant propagation works using constant types, like Char('3'). The type of a value definition is widened to its underlying type, unless the value is declared final. I guess the clean solution would be to make the type checker assign constant types for non-final values when they are defined inside an object definition (thus being implicitly final).

However I have tried at least twice to do this (not recently) and it's not so easy.  You get a whole boatload of subtle behavioral changes by messing with it.
(In r21147) Clarified syntax and rules for constant expressions. Closes #3142. Review by extempore.
Constant expressions are necessary for smooth Java interop. It's important to have an explicit syntax for them, because they affect binary compatibility. That's why a long long time ago we discussed this issue at length and opted for the explicit final syntax.
