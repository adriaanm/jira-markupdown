A simple execution of {{baseClasses}} indicates it return things that are not classes:

{code}
scala> reflect.runtime.universe.typeOf[String].baseClasses foreach println
class String
trait CharSequence
trait Comparable
trait Serializable
class Object
class Any
{code}

(as a side note, I'd rather it returned {{AnyRef}} than {{Object}})

I understand that, since the return type is {List[Symbol]}, calling it {{baseTypes}} would be misleading, but {{Symbol}} is not a {{Class}} either, and {{trait}} is definitely something I wouldn't expect to be listed on a method called {{baseClasses}}.
