Given the following source files:

`src/pack/Queue.java`

```scala
package pack;
public interface Queue { }
```


`src/pack/BlockingQueue.java`

```scala
package pack;
import java.util.Queue;
public interface BlockingQueue<E> extends Queue<E> { }
```

`src/pack/Test.scala`

```scala
package pack
trait Test {
  val b: BlockingQueue[Nothing]
}
```

feeding the three files into scalac gives the following error:

```scala
lamppc11:main luc$$ mkdir out
lamppc11:main luc$$ ~/scala/git/target/pack/bin/scalac src/pack/*.java src/pack/Test.scala 
src/pack/BlockingQueue.java:5: error: pack.Queue does not take type parameters
public interface BlockingQueue<E> extends Queue<E> {
                                          ^
one error found
```


In the supertype of `BlockingQueue`, `Queue` should resolve to `java.lang.Queue`, not to `pack.Queue`.

Compiling the java files first and feeding only the scala file to scalac works.
(In r24105) workaround for see #3936, allows building everything inside intellij. no review
I hit this bug today. is it considered low priority, or was it simply overlooked?

on the one hand, it's easy to work around. on the other hand, working around it involves modifying valid Java sources.
I just stumbled across this bug. As the java class triggering this issue was generated with jaxb from an xsd, it can't be trivially worked around by just editing the java source (jaxb is called by the build process, so changes would be overwritten).

Fortunately, I have no java code referencing scala code, so just compiling the java code with javac first works for me. Still, I think this issue could cause problems in real world projects.
Is this issue different from #7232 (which seems fixed now)?
I just sent a pull request containing exactly the example given by Lukas: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2677

It fails with 2.10.1 and works with 2.10.2 and current master. This is all I checked, so I didn't really verify that #3936 is a duplicate of #7232. However, I think it's safe to close #3936.
Duplicate of #7232
