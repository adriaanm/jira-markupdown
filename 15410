I suggest two swing utilities:

1. Textarea collecting System.out

The trait OutputCatcher gives a textarea
the capability to catch outputstreams
```scala
val outArea = new TextArea with OutputCatcher {
	catchSystemOut
}
```

and from now on println commands send their text
into the textarea.

DemoCatcher = an example of a TextArea catching System.out


2. interpreter running in TextArea

The ScalaArea (subclass of TextArea) feeds user input to the REPL
and catches the results from the REPL

DemoScalaArea = TextArea with Scala interpreter inside

Unfortunately I don't know how to activate auto completion.

Source code ist attachted. To run the demos
```scala
scala demo.DemoCatcher
scala demo.DemoScalaArea
```
