Implicit conversion for fully-applied types work, but the compiler crashes on a implicit conversion that takes a **->** type constructor as parameter.

Can we either make this work, or more likely signal an error on definition of these kinds of conversions?

Test in `pending/pos/t0716.scala`
Martin, this is essentially a dup of #445

The type inferencer should not try to infer higher-kinded types. It's on my TODO list, but I need some time to fix this, as I don't know the type inference code base well enough.
