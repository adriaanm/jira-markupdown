In case it has any bearing on your evaluation, you may want to know the actual motivation for the complicated logic in stringOf.  It is summarized as:
{code}
// Given:
List(Array(1))
// How to print as above and not as:
List([I@18f55759)
{code}
100% of the logic spins out of the inability to change Array's toString method.  It does not arise from some high-minded attempt to improve everybody's toString method.

Your "HasStringRepr" idea is haskell's Show typeclass.  It would be my preference to use Show (and Eq) in preference to universal equals and toString wherever possible, but there is not general agreement on this point and there are performance implications.
