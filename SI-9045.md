In the code

```scala
case class AffineImageShape(axes: Seq[Int]) {
  def this(axes: Array[Int]) = this(axes)
}
```

The error is

```
Error:(4, 34) called constructor's definition must precede calling constructor's definition
```

This is true but it would be more helpful to say

```
Error: constructor calls itself
```
