This looks at least related to SI-3634, which involves raw types. I'm pretty sure though, that there are also other duplicates about this ...

The source code in the source jar defines:

{code}
public class PriorityBuffer extends AbstractCollection implements Buffer, Serializable { ... }
{code}

So basically:

 - this involves raw types, which are not supported in Scala
 - Sun/Oracle reserves the right to remove support of raw types from javac in the future

 => this will most probably be a WON'T FIX
 => it is Apache's duty to fix it (but considering that the last release was 2008, I consider the library to be not maintained)

@Daniel: Your best chance is to file a bug in Apache's bug tracker for it.
