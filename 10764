@Grzegorz- Well the 'claims' were substantiated with citations. I mean Brian Goetz said they are much more performant, I just reference his talk. I wonder if they overfitted some performance use case...

@Jason- I don't really think something kicking in would've had a large effect, this benchmark uses a single core.
Also, the reason I used lists is because I want to use them idiomatically, the way they will be used.
However I was thinking of doing another benchmark in isolation (using Scala however), but given the bytecode would look the same I think what you've done would be very similar, so thanks for doing it!
