After a (too) long discussion on the mailing list it looks like  lists with generics are only availabe as raw lists to Java.

Here's a simple example:
{code}
object ScUtil {
  def getAList() : java.util.List[java.lang.Double] = {
    	 return java.util.Arrays.asList(List(new java.lang.Double(0.0)):_*)
     }
}
{code}
If I call this function from Java the return type is only *List* instead of *List<Double>*.

{code}
public class ScTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List x4 = ScUtil.getAList();//better List<Double>
  }
}
{code}

Maybe the same is true for other collections or even all generic types but haven't test it. Because generics are one of the most important features in Java in my opinion it's very important to fix it.

Maybe it's related to SI-3070

Yes, this is a duplicate of SI-3070. As a workaround for now you can configure Eclipse's Java compiler to report unchecked generic type operations as warnings rather than errors.
