[Pull request 139|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/139] closes the issue by documenting the behavior and providing a `quoteReplacement` method on Scala's `Regex` object.

The behavior makes sense for the other replace methods, and I think it would be more surprising to have this one behave differently than having it behave like it does. The workaround is not too inconvenient, and proper documentation goes a long way towards addressing the issue.
