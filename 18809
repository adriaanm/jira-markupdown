At the moment Assign is context sensitive due to the fact that it can't be distinguished from named argument:
{code}
def f(x: Any) = x 
var x = ...
f(x = 2) 
{code}
In order to minimize ambiguity we can force people who really want to have assign in that position should add extra parens or curly braces to disambiguate:
{code}
f(x = 2) // named arg
f((x = 2)) // assign
f { x = 2 } // assign
{code}
This would allow us to replace AssignOrNamedArg tree with just NamedArg.
