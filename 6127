This is one of the bugs with DelayedInit. The first instantiation of C should have the same output as the second instantiation of C and similarly for the others.

I'm all for your alternative if we could get it introduced, but as it is DelayedInit exists now but requires bug-fixes...a new feature to the language I find doubtful at least in 2.10. I think it's reasonable for DelayedInit to be fixed before you can consider 2.10 to be out of RC considering this is a glaring bug that needs to be fixed.
