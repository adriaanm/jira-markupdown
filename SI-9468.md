Welcome to Scala version 2.11.7 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_60).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> (".*".r findAllIn "foo").toList
res0: List[String] = List(foo, "")

scala> (".*".r findAllMatchIn "foo" map { _.matched }).toList
res1: List[String] = List(foo, "")
```

IMHO, the empty string at the end of each list is superfluous because the entire string has already been matched.
Compare this with:

```scala
scala> (".*".r findAllIn "").toList
res2: List[String] = List("")
```

Here, the empty string is the only match of the regex in the string, so this is correct.
The behaviour is actually correct (unless I'm missing something). You'd get the same behaviour if you were to use just the `java.util.regex.Pattern/Matcher` classes (which are wrapped by the Scala classes anyway).
The `.*` means any character (including empty string) any number of times (including zero).
If you wanted the empty string out of the result list you could use `.+` instead.
`X*` certainly matches empty input. I'm not sure if there are words to clarify the behavior in the doc. For instance, someone asked that it specify that matches are "non-overlapping", so that language was added.

Here's an imperative look:

```
scala> 
import java.util.regex._

scala> val m = Pattern.compile(".*").matcher("foo")
m: java.util.regex.Matcher = java.util.regex.Matcher[pattern=.* region=0,3 lastmatch=]

scala> m find 0
res0: Boolean = true

scala> (m.start, m.end)
res1: (Int, Int) = (0,3)

scala> m find 3
res2: Boolean = true

scala> (m.start, m.end)
res3: (Int, Int) = (3,3)
```

There are different ways to achieve a given result, and various forums for regex golf.

```
scala> "x*?".r findAllMatchIn "xxyx" map (_.matched) toList
res4: List[String] = List("", "", "", "", "")

scala> "x*?(?=.)".r findAllMatchIn "xxyx" map (_.start) toList
res5: List[Int] = List(0, 1, 2, 3)

scala> "x*(?=.)".r findAllMatchIn "xxyx" map (_.start) toList
res6: List[Int] = List(0, 2, 3)

scala> "x*|.".r findAllMatchIn "xxyx" map (_.start) toList
res7: List[Int] = List(0, 2, 3, 4)

scala> "x+|.".r findAllMatchIn "xxyx" map (_.start) toList
res8: List[Int] = List(0, 2, 3)

scala> "x*".r findAllMatchIn "xxyx" filter (_.start < 4) map (_.matched) toList
res9: List[String] = List(xx, "", x)
```
