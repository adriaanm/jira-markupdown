I have a Mac OS X 10.5 laptop on which I also run an Ubuntu 8.04 VM. When I run the Scala 2.7.5 REPL in Mac OS X, it always seems a bit slow in starting up and in responding to input. What's strange though is that running it in a Linux VM on the same machine makes it faster. This might not be a problem with Scala, but it may be worth taking a look at because it's pretty consistent.

It's hard to capture timings for interactive use of the REPL, but it seems that starting it up can take 1-2 seconds and then typing something like 1+1 can take 2 more seconds to run. I did however capture some deterministic timings by running `scala -e 'print(1+1)'` on both platforms. The timings after allowing for some period of warmup are as follows:
```scala
# Mac OS X
$$ time scala -e 'print(1+1)'
2
real	0m1.689s
user	0m0.795s
sys	0m0.139s

# Ubuntu VM
$$ time scala -e 'print(1+1)'
2
real	0m0.912s
user	0m0.092s
sys	0m0.240s
```

The JVM version is 1.6.0_07 on Linux and 1.6.0_13 on OS X.
