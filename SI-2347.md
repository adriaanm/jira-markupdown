In trunk, ArrayBuffer has a dangerous sizeHint method:
```scala
    override def sizeHint(len: Int) {
        val newarray = new Array[AnyRef](len min 1)
        Array.copy(array, 0, newarray, 0, size0)
        array = newarray
    }
```
The new array will be smaller than size0 if len is.  The documentation should scream loudly that it's not allowed to sizeHint less than the current size, or (len min 1) should become (len min 1 min size0)
