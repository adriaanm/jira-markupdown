build.sbt:
```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.0-RC1"

addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.0.0-SNAPSHOT" cross CrossVersion.full)

resolvers ++= Seq(
    Resolver.mavenLocal,
    Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots"),
    Resolver.sonatypeRepo("releases"),
    Resolver.typesafeRepo("releases")
    )
```


sbt console-quick will explode.

Don't know if it has to do with macro paradise or not. Guessing not, but tagging as macros just in case.
