scala.swing.Frame exposes no way to set a GraphicsConfiguration, which is essential for writing full-screen Swing apps.  

Because the only way to set this is through the JFrame constructor (naturally inaccessible to s.s.Frame clients), we can't drop back to the peer, and scala.swing must be discarded.

This can be simply supported by adding this code to the Frame (and preferably MainFrame) classes: 

```scala
class Frame(gc: java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration = null) extends RichWindow {
  override lazy val peer: JFrame with InterfaceMixin = new JFrame(gc) with InterfaceMixin with SuperMixin

...
}

```

```scala
class MainFrame(gc: java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration = null) extends Frame(gc) {
...
}
```

(imaier in [r25494](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25494)) Added GraphicsConfiguration to window, frame, dialog constructors. Closes #3853.
