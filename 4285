several weird things seem to be happening: the implicit `this` in `self: SomeImplA{type A = this.ImplA}` points to the refinement, not to `SomeImplA`. Even after correcting this to `self`, the program won't type check.

Anyway, I guess this is as spec'ed after all, since it's the class's _self type_ that must conform to the inherited self types, not the class's type.
