String interpolation treats everything as a raw string.  (But the escape parser is buggy.)
I'm not sure what {{s"""\t"""}} ought to do.  The format specifier says it's simply formatted as opposed to raw, i.e. {{raw"""\t"""}} or {{raw"\t"}}.  But the triple quotes say it's raw.

In case of ambiguity, you will find a life jacket under the seat in front of you.  The person to your right, however, should use their seat cushion as a floatation device.

It's simple enough to fix the bug (note: octal parsing is buggy also), but the correct behavior is nonobvious without a nontrivial change to something.
It is pretty much intentional indeed. Strings in Scala offer either multiline capability or escape characters, but not both at the same time, nor neither at the same time.

String interpolators make it possible to have any particular combination, by letting multiline be decided by the number of quotes, and escaping be decided by the interpolator.

Though I do see the potential for confusion, and I'm certain plenty will arise from it, I think it was the right choice. I wouldn't be bold enough to make it, but I find it easy to support Odersky on this. :-)

This particular ticket is not a bug, because there's nothing for the \ before $ to escape. If you use the raw interpolator, it will work. If you double the backslashes, it will work. Everything is according to spec, and, at most, a better error message is required. I'd call it enhancement.

I know I should really have a pull request or at least a diff.  But anyway, here's fixed code that

(1) Throws the correct exception on an error

(2) Does not fail on a short octal at the end of a string {{s"\4"}}

(3) Uses the {{append(str, a, b)}} string builder method, which should be faster than substring (no object creation required)

{code}
  def treatEscapes(str: String): String = {
    lazy val bldr = new java.lang.StringBuilder
    val len = str.length
    var start = 0
    var cur = 0
    var idx = 0
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr.append(str, start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
    while (idx < len) {
      cur = idx
      if (str(idx) == '\\') {
        idx += 1
        if (idx >= len) throw new InvalidEscapeException(str, cur)
        if ('0' <= str(idx) && str(idx) <= '7') {
          val leadch = str(idx)
          var oct = leadch - '0'
          idx += 1
          if (idx < len && '0' <= str(idx) && str(idx) <= '7') {
            oct = oct * 8 + str(idx) - '0'
            idx += 1
            if (idx < len && leadch <= '3' && '0' <= str(idx) && str(idx) <= '7') {
              oct = oct * 8 + str(idx) - '0'
              idx += 1
            }
          }
          output(oct.toChar)
        } else {
          val ch = str(idx)
          idx += 1
          output {
            ch match {
              case 'b' => '\b'
              case 't' => '\t'
              case 'n' => '\n'
              case 'f' => '\f'
              case 'r' => '\r'
              case '\"' => '\"'
              case '\'' => '\''
              case '\\' => '\\'
              case _ => throw new InvalidEscapeException(str, cur)
            }
          }
        }
      } else {
        idx += 1
      }
    }
    if (start == 0) str
    else bldr.append(str, start, idx).toString
  }
{code}

It does not address the issue of it being weird that {{s"""\n"""}} gives you a carriage return.  It also does not address the issue that {{s"\""}} doesn't do what you think it will.
Rex's suggestions:

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1690

To the original reporter: you should use {{raw"c:\foo\bar"}} or {{raw"""c:\foo\bar"""}} to avoid string escape processing. But beware, unicode escapes, e.g {{\u1234}} are still processed as they happen much much earlier. So {{raw"c:\users"}} doesn't work. You can actually turn off unicode escape processing with the compiler option {{-Xno-uescape}}. Or make your life easier, and use '/' in strings as path separators.
I've submitted Rex's suggestions as https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1690.

Santosh: you can use {{raw"c:\foo\$filename"}} to avoid interpreting '\' as an escape character.

But beware, {{\uNNNN}} is always treated as a unicode escape, unless you use the non-standard compiler option {{-Xno-uescape}}. I always use '/' as a path separator in literal strings to avoid these issues; even on Windows this is allowed.
