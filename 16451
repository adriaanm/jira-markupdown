It seems there is a bug in Predef:

{{def readLine(text: String, args: Any*) = Console.readLine(text, args)}}

When I think it should be:

{{def readLine(text: String, args: Any*) = Console.readLine(text, args: _*)}}

The first version causes the args to be be wrapped in {{WrappedArray}} when called like this: {{readLine("hello %s%n", "world")}}

See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7693872/predef-readline-behaviour

I'm not sure why {{WrappedArray}} but a quick test in REPL shows the second version would work and also it makes sense to use the type ascription to use the seq as a repeated parameter.
