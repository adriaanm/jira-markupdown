instantiating a mixin object, for instance a "new WeakHashMap with SynchronizedMap" inside a code block whose result is used as a super-constructor parameter causes a java.lang.VerifyError. The same code works fine when removing the "with SynchronizedMap" mixin or when calling the code block as a "static" method on a companion object, but when written directly into the super call it fails.

The attached Test.scala App demonstrates this by implementing three subclasses of the same parent class, one for each described variant, and then instantiating them. The third case in the test is the broken one and causes the error upon execution.

The error is "java.lang.VerifyError: (class: Child, method: <init> signature: ()V) Expecting to find object/array on stack"
