Sorry, I should have provided this information on the first time. My OS is Win XP, I am running Scala 2.7.5final (but had the same error on 2.7.4) with a Sun JVM 1.6.0_13. I have reproduced the error on Win2000 as well. 

For copying I provide the code once more in one block:
{code}
    import scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList
    val llist = new LinkedList(0, null)
    for (i <- 0 until 1000000) {
      llist.append(new LinkedList(i, null))
    }
{code}

I start the scala command line and copy the code. That's it. The optimisation for tail recursions is on by default, right?
