For the below code, the compiler issues no warning; only the runtime catches the `MatchError`:

```scala
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

val (c : Int, p: TermName) = {
 val (c1 : Int, p1: List[TermName]) = {
  (5, List(null))
 }
 (c1, p1)
}
```

When importing `TermName` explicitly, a warning is issued:

```scala
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe.TermName
...

warning: abstract type pattern reflect.runtime.universe.TermName is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
```

However, as it is known that `TermName <: NameApi`, the latter being an abstract class, I believe that the correct warning would have been a `fruitless type test` warning.
The wildcard import also imports `TermNameTag`, which is an implicit of type `ClassTag[TermName]`. The pattern matcher uses this to perform a type test on an otherwise abstract type.

Here's a look at this independentally of the reflection API.

```scala
trait T {
  type A
  implicit def ATag: scala.reflect.ClassTag[A]
}

class Test1 {
  def scrutinee: Any = ""
  def test(t: T) = scrutinee match {
    case _: t.A => // warning: abstract type pattern t.A is unchecked
  }

  def test2(t: T) = {
    import t.ATag
    scrutinee match {
      case _: t.A => // no warning, translated to `if (ATag.runtimeClass.isInstance(scrutinee)) ...`
    }    
  }
}
```
Thanks for the clarification; sorry for not thinking about this.
So you are also saying that in this case, the most I should've expected is a `Match is not exhaustive` warning?
