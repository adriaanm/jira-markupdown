Related to that, I just noticed that in this commit:

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b9e01a04618764cceb251830400b1a74ff8f02d3

a part of the test just got commented out. That part of the test was supposed to check if legacy list deserialization works.
The commit message says:

> Hmmm, the giant blob of binary data embedded in a test

As I was unsure what are binary compatibility requirements exactly say on serialization, I've implemented legacy deserialization for lists deserialized from 2.9.x.
It seems that just prior to that change, somebody changed something in `List` and legacy deserialization stopped working (could this have also been due to a different JVM version?).

I've just implemented a fallback for legacy deserialization for lists serialized with 2.10.0.
I can send it in, however, I see no way of writing a test for it other than the one I've had in `test/files/run/t5374.scala`.
