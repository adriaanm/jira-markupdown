=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
case class Ev[T](x: T)

object Yupi {
  implicit val strEv: Ev[String] = Ev("str")

  def ohno[T](implicit m: Manifest[T], e: Ev[T]): T = e.x
  def ohyes[T](implicit e: Ev[T], m: Manifest[T]): T = e.x

  val x = ohno
  val y = ohyes

}
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
I'm not sure if this code should compile at all but what I would expect is deterministic result (code compiles or compiler fails with the same sort of problems reported).


=== What do you see instead? ===
Either:
{code}
mac-grek:tmp grek$$ scala implicits.scala 
/Users/grek/tmp/implicits.scala:9: error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: this.Ev[T]
  val x = ohno
          ^
one error found
{code}

or:
{code}
mac-grek:tmp grek$$ scala implicits.scala 
/Users/grek/tmp/implicits.scala:9: error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: this.Ev[Nothing]
  val x = ohno
          ^
/Users/grek/tmp/implicits.scala:10: error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: this.Ev[Nothing]
  val y = ohyes
          ^
two errors found
{code}

I couldn't find any way to reliably trigger first or second behaviour. The only thing that seems to be consistent is that scalac tends to 'stick' to one of behaviour for a while so if you want to reproduce it you might want to have one hour between subsequent runs of scalac.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.0, 2.8.1., 2.9.0.RC2 (all three behave in the same way)
  - Java: build 1.6.0_24-b07-334-10M3326, 64bit
  - Operating system: MacOs 10.6.7
As far as I know there is no random number generator in the compiler, so there must be some deterministic way of triggering this. We just don't know what it is yet. I bet  *something* was different in the environment between those two runs.

Maybe it's caches filling up, or other limits being reached, but I find it hard to believe it's just a matter of using the compiler daemon at certain time intervals. Are you sure your classpath was the same (with the same contents) everytime? Maybe you had some stale classfiles laying around? Can you try with fsc as well (I sure hope this can't be reproduced with scalac!). 

There must be a deterministic way to trigger both results; lacking that, I'm afraid it's going to be nearly impossible to fix. (I did try to repro, will try again in an hour...)
