Using the attached context diff it is possible to build the scala library for cldc 1.0. Some of the workarounds for cldc were outdated. 
But there is a problem left. In List.scala (methods private def writeObject(out: ObjectOutputStream) and private def readObject(in: ObjectInputStream)) a serialization mechanism is used that is not available on the cldc platform.

It would be useful to have a serialisation mechanism that builds on more fundamental java (or scala) mechanisms to stay compatible with J2SE and CLDC 1.0. Otherwise it is not possible to exchange list based data between mobile and non-mobile java applications.
