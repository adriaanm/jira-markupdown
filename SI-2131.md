Hello,

Eclipse 3.5 ; Scala 2.7.5 , Ubuntu 9.04

When I use Refactor -> Move on a class Eclipse will move the class ok, but it somehow still remains a reference to it just in the old package. I can only use the moved class in classes of the old package if I use its full name (like com.pfalabs.core.Master). 

Even if I import the new class like 'import com.pfalabs.core.Master' it still tries to use the old class some how.
What is more interesting is that is holds a reference to the old version. If I update the class at some point, Eclipse will complain about non existing methods on the class that is not there any more.

To recap:

- I have a 'Master' class in the 'com.pfalabs.core' package.

- A 'Slave' class in the same package: 'com.pfalabs.core'.

- Refactor - Move the 'Master' to another package 
'com.pfalabs.service' 

- Add a new method to the 'Master' class. Let's call it 'newTest'

If I try to use this new method in the 'Slave' class - wich appears to use the old class, Eclipse will complain (error) about the non-existent method on 'Master'
If I try to import it by package: 'import com.pfalabs.service.Master' Eclipse will complain (only a warning) about the import hiding the real class.

The only way I can use the Master class now is to reference it by its full name like 'com.pfalabs.service.Master' wherever I define a val.

Eclipse restart doesn't seem to fix this

thanks

Yes, of course it should work. But your telling me that a clean build makes the problem go away tells me something about what the problem actually is, and also makes me confident that work that's ongoing on trunk will solve it properly.
