The comment on Position.includes says that "This holds [if] this is a range position", but in the implementation of RangePosition, it's only checked whether the other position `isDefined` and not `isRange`, so it can be true if the other position is an OffsetPosition.

Whatever the correct behavior is, either the code or the documentation should be fixed.
(In r24401) Clarify documentation of Position.includes, closes SI-2874. No review.
