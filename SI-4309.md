=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
scala> Char.MinValue to Char.MaxValue
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
It printed all characters (using these "boxes with numbers" if not available).


=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
[line elided for control chars: possibly a scala signature]
```


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r24343-b20110224020040
This spams the console as of 2.10, but the Range.toString is truncated at half a kay.
```scala
scala> $intp.isettings.maxPrintString = Int.MaxValue
$intp.isettings.maxPrintString: Int = 2147483647

scala> Char.MinValue to Char.MaxValue toList
