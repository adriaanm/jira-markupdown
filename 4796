The try blocks in the example only contains a single statement: an assignment to x.  So, either construction fails and x is uninitialized, or it succeeds and x is initialized.  You might as well just write:
{code}
  val x = new Integer(0)
  println(x)
{code}

Usually, you would perform some operation on x after construction and I assume you are claiming the usual idiom is insufficient:
{code}
val x = <construct>
try { f(x) }
finally { cleanup(x) }
{code}
