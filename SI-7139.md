{code:title=test/A.scala}
package test {
  object A
}
package object test {
  type A = Int
}
```scala
{code:title=repl}
scala> val a = test.A
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : test.A.type
 required: Any
Note that A extends Any, not AnyRef.
Such types can participate in value classes, but instances
cannot appear in singleton types or in reference comparisons.
 + "a: test.A.type = " + scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.replStringOf(`a`, 1000)
                                                                                      ^
```
Variation:
{code:title=A.scala}

package test {
  object A {
    def apply(n: A) = n
  }
}
package object test {
  type A = Int
}
```scala
{code:title=repl}
scala> import test._
import test._

scala> A(0)
res0: test.A = 0

scala> A(0)
<console>:11: error: test.A.type does not take parameters
              A(0)
               ^
```
This issue isn't limited to the REPL, it also causes compilation issues in multi-module builds. We saw the following symptom:

```
[error] bad symbolic reference to io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction.Functions encountered in class file 'SQSAction.class'.
[error] Cannot access type Functions in object io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction. The current classpath may be
[error] missing a definition for io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction.Functions, or SQSAction.class may have been compiled against a version that's
[error] incompatible with the one found on the current classpath.
[error] /work/aws-scala/sqs/src/test/scala/io/atlassian/aws/sqs/SQSSpec.scala:48: value ok is not a member of object io.atlassian.aws.sqs.SQSAction
[error]         _ <- handles.headOption.map { h => SQS.changeVisibility(url, h, Duration(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) } getOrElse SQSAction.ok(())
[error]                                                                                                                              ^
```
A workaround should be:

```scala
package test {
  object A0
}
package object test {
  type A = Int
  val A: A0.type = A0
}
```
Reproduction with the resident compiler:

```scala
% scalac sandbox/test.scala
% scalac -Xresident

nsc> sandbox/test2.scala

nsc> sandbox/test2.scala
sandbox/test2.scala:2: error: type mismatch;
 found   : p.X.type
 required: AnyRef
Note that X extends Any, not AnyRef.
Such types can participate in value classes, but instances
cannot appear in singleton types or in reference comparisons.
  private[this] val res1 = (null: p.X.type)
                                    ^
```
