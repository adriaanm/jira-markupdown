When creating a New Scala Project, the Working Sets drop down list is empty, and clicking Select shows an empty box. From here, if one tries to click New, it will complain that working set already exists.
After project is created it's easy to assign a working set by right clicking the project and selecting Assign Working Sets. But this is an extra step.
This is a duplicate of ticket SI-2703.
