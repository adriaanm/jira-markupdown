From what we currently understand we cannot go forward with this ticket. What we really need is a minimized example, showing the undesired / missing behavior, and a clear statement of what the desired result is.

More concretely, I can't see what annotations are needed in which classfile and on which method precisely. We need something along the lines "compile trait X and class Y extending X, and obtain classfiles X and X$class and Y. we need annotation a on method m in classfile C, but it's not there".

Then we can discuss how it is possible to get there. Saying "it doesn't work with hibernate" is not enough, our knowledge of hibernate is close to zero.
