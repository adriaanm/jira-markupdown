See the two instances I have below (taken from REPL)

Native XML handling, preserves the newline character.
```scala
scala> <foo key="val
     | ue" />
res0: scala.xml.Elem = 
<foo key="val
ue"/>
```

XML.loadString, however, converts to a newline.
```scala
scala> XML.loadString("""<foo key="val
     | ue" />""")
res3: scala.xml.Elem = <foo key="val ue"/>
```

As such, the XML blocks are not equal.
```scala
scala> res0 equals res3
res6: Boolean = false
```

Newlines NOT inside of attributes are preserved in both instances are are equal as such.
```scala
scala> <foo>
     | bar
     | baz
     | </foo>
res4: scala.xml.Elem = 
<foo>
bar
baz
</foo>

scala> XML.loadString("""<foo>
     | bar
     | baz
     | </foo>""")
res5: scala.xml.Elem = 
<foo>
bar
baz
</foo>

scala> res4 equals res5
res7: Boolean = true
```
