Actually I was wrong, it's this which is used: "com.github.seratch" %% "awscala" % "0.5.+"

also here is the s3 object:


{code:java}
implicit val s3 = S3(config.getString("amazon.key").get, config.getString("amazon.secret").get)(awscala.Region.Ireland)
{code}

I just played around a little bit, and it doesn't seem to be the java conversion.
Commenting out all of that makes the compiler still fail with only the changes to the case classes.
I also use upickle (which is a macro library to convert case class to json) 

http://lihaoyi.github.io/upickle-pprint/upickle/
with this version: "com.lihaoyi" %% "upickle" % "0.3.6"
