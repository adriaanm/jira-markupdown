Another in the thrilling series of language features which require the application of rocket science just to get them to leave you alone. All I want is the class object, must it be so hard? See also #8039 for what is in some sense the dual nightmare.

```scala
class A {
  // Splitting out the implicit class doesn't help.
  implicit class Foo[A](x: A) { def bar(f: A => Seq[A]) = f(x) }

  // Okay, fair enough this doesn't work. Overly specific type is
  // inferred and then dooms us later.
  def f1 = classOf[List[_]] bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
  // a.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : Seq[Class[_]]
  //  required: Seq[Class[List[_]]]
  //   def f1 = classOf[List[_]] bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
  //                                                  ^

  // Apparently Class[_] is STILL too specific. Can anyone suggest a
  // less specific type which is still a Class?
  def f2 = (classOf[List[_]] : Class[_]) bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
  //  found   : Seq[Class[_]]
  //  required: Seq[Class[_$3]] where type _$3
  //   def f2 = (classOf[List[_]] : Class[_]) bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
  //

  // Giving it a type parameter home doesn't help either.
  def f3[A](x: Class[A]) = x bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
  // found   : Seq[Class[_]]
  // required: Seq[Class[A]]
  //  def f3[A](x: Class[A]) = x bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
  //                                                  ^

  // At this point we've blown way past the "worth the trouble"
  // boundary, but for the record it compiles this way.
  def f4 = new Foo[Class[_]](classOf[List[_]]) bar (_.getInterfaces.toSeq)
}
```
And if you're tempted to suggest something like
```scala
  implicit class Foo[A](x: A) { def bar[A1 >: A](f: A => Seq[A1]) = f(x) }
```
The problem is that this method is called repeatedly/recursively.
Let's look at through this example. I'm avoiding the placeholder syntax for existentials to highlight the different types.

```scala
trait C[A] { def bar(f: A => A) }

trait M[A] { def m: M[Y] forSome { type Y } = ??? }

object Test {
  def c[A](a: A): C[A] = ???

  def x1(m: M[Int]) = c/*[M[Int]]]*/(m).bar(_.m) // found M[Y] where type Y, required M[Int]

  def x2(m: M[Int]) = c/*[M[X]]]*/(m : M[X] forSome { type X }).bar(_.m) //found M[Y] where type Y, required M[X] where type X

  def x3(m: M[Int]) = c[M[Z] forSome {type Z}](m).bar(_.m)
}
```

I don't believe that you can provide an argument to method `c` that will lead to inference of the type argument explicitly provided in `x3`, which is the only one that will end up allowing `_.m` to typecheck.
I take it you mean "don't believe that you CAN provide an argument to method `c`..."

It seems you are correct. It would need to leave some slack in the first type inferred for the second one ever to conform to it.
