There is a logic error which causes an NPE in AbstractFile.scala with the `exists` method. The current code:

{code}
  /** Does this abstract file denote an existing file? */
  def exists: Boolean = (file eq null) || file.exists
{code}

This causes an NPE if file is NULL since it proceeds to check "file.exists." This logic is incorrect anyways.

I've attached a patch which fixes this.

I apologize in advance for all the whitespace removal, my editor automatically removes trailing whitespace D:
