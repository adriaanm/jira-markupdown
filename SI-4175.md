=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===

Consider this code (by amacleod):
{code}
implicit def IntToMonth(n: Int) = Month(n)

case class Month(m: Int)
case class YearMonth(y: Int, m: Month)

val someYearMonth(2000, 1)
val someYearMonth(2000, January) //Both work


YearMonth(2011, Month(1)) match {
  case YearMonth(2011, 1) => println("now") //This doesn't
  case _ => println("not now")
}

/*
<console>:15: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(1)
 required: Month
         case YearMonth(2011, 1) => println("now")
*/
{code}



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

I added an implicit conversion from Int to Month to make it possible to use YearMonth with two Ints.
This works as expected.

I expected that the implicit will work the same in the pattern match. 

=== What do you see instead? ===

The implicit method is ignored and a type mismatch is reported.

=== Additional information ===
Refried pointed me to a related discussion on the mailing list: http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/implicit-conversions-and-pattern-matching-td1986793.html

The difference is that in the case of the mailing list the behavior of the whole pattern match would change (Conversion of the whole class to another class).

In this example code is rejected by the compiler with a type mismatch although an implicit method which could fix it is in scope. (Conversion of an "case class" argument, where the expected type is known at compile time.)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r24003-b20110118020144
  - Java:  OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.10
Was the above said before or after the pattern match rewrite?

implicit arguments and enrichment should both work in extractors now
I've tested this works for enriching a custom stringcontext with an unapply method (don't rememebr the details)
