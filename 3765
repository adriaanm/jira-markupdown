I'm sure there are more cases where we generate javasigs that aren't up to snuff
part of the problem is I don't know what the spec of these things is (there is some obscure pdf by sunacle that Iulian pointed me to)
another aspect is that we can't test these things using partest (yet)
need to compile a scala file, then run javac -Xprint on all the generated classes and ensure the sigs are ok

for this example, and class `A$$X$$1`, the fix for this ticket ensures it looks like (note the `null` for the outer pointer argument's name...) 
```scala
$$ scalac a.scala
$$ javac -cp .:$$SCALA_HOME/lib/scala-library.jar  -Xprint 'A$$X$$1'

  public class X$$1 extends A<java.lang.Object> implements scala.ScalaObject {
    public X$$1(A<U> null);
  }
```
