You've got my vote.  The currently necessary "var x: Foo = null; try {...}" pattern is a blight on the language.  The attempt to use Option is well-intentioned but a non-starter: yes null is discouraged, but it's also in the language and this is the kind of place where you suck it up and use it.  No upside to introducing more special rules.

I suggest this be considered in concert with scala/bug#2807 because they both involve characteristics unique to try/catch/finally blocks, where including them in a generalization has unfortunate consequences and if we're willing to bend the rules a little when exceptions go flying we can remove some thorns from our paws.
