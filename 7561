Actually, the latter assignments are not translated by the compiler to invocations of `updateDynamic`. If we look at the tree after typers, it looks as follows:
```scala
    private[this] val foo: A = new A();
    Test.this.foo.updateDynamic("xxx")(3);
    scala.this.Predef.println(foo.xxx = 3);
    private[this] val x: <error> = foo.xxx = 3.==()
```
