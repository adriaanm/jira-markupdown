= problem =
Startup and class loading times are slow, e. g. when starting the REPL.

= analysis =
One possibility to improve startup time is using the VM's faster type-checking bytecode verifier, which will become mandatory with class file version 51.0 (Java 7).

At the moment scalac emits classfiles with version 49.0 which leads to the usage of the old (and slow) type-inferencing verifier.

Using the new (and faster) type-checking verifier requires emitting classfiles of at least version 50.0 and adding the new (and mandatory as of 51.0) classfile attribute StackMapTable to created classfiles.
