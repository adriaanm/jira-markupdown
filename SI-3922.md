```scala

scala> (0 to Int.MaxValue) foreach println

scala>
```

Nothing prints in above sample.

If the range starts at 1 instead of 0, each integer in range prints as expected (did not verify that it completed to conclusion).

Any start value of 0 or less silently fails (to surprise of user).

Range created using syntax in REPL sample is a scala.collection.immutable.Range.Inclusive with scala.collection.immutable.Range.ByOne.

Using just a scala.collection.immutable.Range directly via explicit new Range(0, Int.MaxValue, 1) works.

Problem occurs in REPL and in app compiled using Eclipse plugin.
Sorry, #3232.
