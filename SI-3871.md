I'm finding all kinds of interesting bugs working on the tree and icode checkers.  The following should not compile, but does.
{code}
class Base {
  def mkNew() = {
    val s = new Sub2
    s.foo = true
    s
  }
}

class Sub2 extends Base {
  protected var foo = false
}
{code}
If this is in doubt, I offer two pieces of evidence.  One, the spec:
{code}
Protected members of a class can be accessed from within

– the template of the defining class
- all templates that have the defining class as a base class
– the companion module of any of those classes.
{code}
The superclass is none of the above.  Secondly, the java behavior prohibits it.  Have to put them in separate packages because java protected allows package access, but note that the scala version (unsurprisingly) has the same behavior either way.
{code}
// J.java
package bong;

import bing.S;

public class J {
  public S bippy() {
    S s = new S();
    s.bip = true;
    return s;
  }
}
// S.java
package bing;

public class S extends bong.J {
  protected boolean bip;
}
{code}
{code}
% javac -d out */*.java
bong/J.java:8: bip has protected access in bing.S
    s.bip = true;
     ^
1 error
{code}

Coming back around to the first sentence, the reason I know about this is that after babying the icode checker back to life, it started telling me about all kinds of stuff which looks wrong to it.  And it seems generally to be correct.  I'm guessing that somewhere in the late stages the compiler starts ignoring everyone and brute forcing its way to the access it wants, trusting itself to do the right thing even after access has been relaxed in some places because of the JVM.  And obvious brokenness arises from being too strict, but being too relaxed can lay hidden indefinitely, and so it does.

Here one place at least where the compiler actually depends upon the incorrect behavior - it seems likely there are more.  Symbols.scala, in class Symbol:
{code}
final def newOuterAccessor(pos: Position) = {
  val sym = newMethod(pos, nme.OUTER) 
  sym setFlag (STABLE | SYNTHETIC)
  if (isTrait) sym setFlag DEFERRED
  sym.expandName(this)
  sym.referenced = this
  sym
}
{code}
And class TermSymbol:
{code}
  class TermSymbol(initOwner: Symbol, initPos: Position, initName: Name)
  extends Symbol(initOwner, initPos, initName) {
    protected var referenced: Symbol = NoSymbol
{code}

It's not a matter of explanation. This one test case passes, but I see no relationship of the code to the spec. So how do we know it's correct? In fact I tend to believe it isn't (but I did not have the time to figure out a counterexample either, sorry).

To explain: Protected is very subtle, and we can not hope to even approximate to have enough tests for it now. The best course of action is to do what's in the spec.


(In r23298) Closes SI-3871. I think this implements the right set of rules, corresponding to the spec. Bonus: better error messages if protected access fails. Review  by extempore.
