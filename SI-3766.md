Been doing some more profiling with 2.8.0.final, and found a hotspot.

Current:

```scala
  override def sizeHint(len: Int) {
    if (len > size && len >= 1) {
      val newarray = new Array[AnyRef](len)
      Array.copy(array, 0, newarray, 0, size0)
      array = newarray
    }
  }
```

array and newarray are statically known to be Array[AnyRef]. The reflective guard `srcClass.isArray && dest.getClass.isAssignableFrom(srcClass)` in Array.copy is always true. This `.isArray` call accounted for 5% of the execution time in the profiling run.

Proposed:

```scala
  override def sizeHint(len: Int) {
    if (len > size && len >= 1) {
      val newarray = new Array[AnyRef](len)
      Platform.arraycopy(array, 0, newarray, 0, size0)
      array = newarray
    }
  }
```

The doc comment for `Array.copy` still refers to boxed arrays, this should be updated.
(In r22779) use arraycopy instead of Array.copy in ArrayBuffer's sizeHint. close #3766, review by extempore.
(In r22780) Revert ArrayBuffer's sizeHint as I had a typo anyway and it needs more thinking. see #3766, see #3767.

This reverts commit bf87118d701df2313a9f680e327ce066765c10d3.
(In r22785) use arraycopy not Array.copy in Arraybuffer.sizeHint. close #3766, #3767. no review.
