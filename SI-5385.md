A source file without blank/newline at the end has incorrect positions for trees that run until the end of the file.

An example: a file {{class A}} without a trailing space has the end position 6 for the PackageDef, ClassDef, Template, etc. If I insert a space at the end of the file, the positions correctly end with 7.

I have several workaround for this in the scala-refactoring library, but every few weeks I find another case where I don't handle this properly, so I'd prefer a proper fix in the compiler :-)
