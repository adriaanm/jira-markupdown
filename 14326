I wrote a small benchmark (attached) to compare performance of actor.receive vs. actor.react.

With scala 2.7.2-final (windows):

- using the receive allows max. 255 actors, otherwise the remaining actors are not "processed" by the scheduler (??) - see output

- react works OK

With scala 2.7.5-final (windows):

- "receive" method does not decrease the number of "processed actors" (sounds strange, but read source code first) after 1 or 2 

- "react" still works fast, but SLOWER than in 2.7.2, especially if actors are started after sending message.

I used Intellij IDEA with scala "optimize" compiler flag.
