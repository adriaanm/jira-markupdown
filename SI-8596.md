When compiling this code with -Yrangepos I get a compiler error. Without -Yrangepos it works.

class TypeTreeObjects {
  class Container {
    def typeParamAndDefaultArg[C](name: String = "sammy"): String = name
  }
  new Container().typeParamAndDefaultArg[Any]()
}

I have created a standalone repo which shows the error, although all you need is the above code + a sbt file.

[~dotta] do you have a few spare cycles to take a look at this one? If not, please assign back to me.
