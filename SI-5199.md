The following code:

trait T1 { this: App =>
  println("arguments in T1: "+ args)
}

trait T2 { this: App =>
  delayedInit {
    println("arguments in T2: "+ args)
  }
}

trait T3 extends DelayedInit { this: App =>
  println("arguments in T3: "+ args)
}

object Main extends App with T1 with T2 with T3 {
  println("arguments in Main: "+ args)
}

generates the following output:

arguments in T1: null
arguments in T3: null
arguments in T2: [Ljava.lang.String;@7bccf12f
arguments in Main: [Ljava.lang.String;@7bccf12f

I understand why T1 gives null and why T2 gives non-null. But I'm confused by T3. The DelayedInit documentation says:

Classes and traits inheriting the `DelayedInit` marker trait will have their initialization code rewritten as follows.
<code> becomes delayedInit(<code>)

Note that it explicitly says that traits are rewritten, so I would expect that T3 would work just like T2?
Fixed the inconsistency in the API docs: [pull request|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/489]

And you're right, this is spec'ed and not a bug. I suggest opening up a discussion on scala-internals for related questions/suggestions.
