The suggested message by the way is not correct.
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long
 required: Int
```
An Int is not required.  Many types are possible, as described (opaquely) in the given error:
```scala
?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(1L) <: Any): ?}  
```
So it's not entirely obvious how to characterize the error.  Heuristics not so popular in these parts.
