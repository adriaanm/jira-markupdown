At minimum it should be a compile time error, as per the other invalid format errors.

I think it might be worth a trip to scala-language or scala-sips to find a consensus. Personally, I'm not strongly attached to the 2.10.x behaviour. One way or another, we should explicitly tests this, document the decision in the Scaladoc for `f`, and in http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html.
