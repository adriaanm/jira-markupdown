A lot of the copyright notices are still
(c) 2002-2013
or
2011-2013
or otherwise ending in 2013.

These should be updated to 2014 (even though 2015 is right around the corner).
Indeed! Here are some semi-recent PRs that updated them in the past. Would be great to keep standardizing or, better yet, automating this.
