This works fine:

{code}
scala> def f(i: => Option[Int] = None) = i
f: (i: => Option[Int])Option[Int]
{code}

but not this:

{code}
scala> class Foo(i: => Option[Int] = None)
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : None.type (with underlying type object None)
 required: => Option[Int]
       class Foo(i: => Option[Int] = None)
{code}

This really unfortunate because I have a class that would benefit from being able to specify None as the default value for a by-name Option.

There is a similar problem with other by-name types.  For example this works:

{code}
scala> def f(i: => Int = 3) = i
f: (i: => Int)Int
{code}

but not this:

{code}
scala> class Foo(i: => Int = 3)
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(3)
 required: => Int
       class Foo(i: => Int = 3)
{code}

It seems like the compiler is failing to handle default values for method and constructor arguments in the same way.
(In r20658) close SI-2929. review by community (see typedValDef in Typers.scala, the BYNAMEPARAM flag was missing).
