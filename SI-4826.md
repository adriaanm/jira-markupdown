Scaladoc already processes Java sources and produces Scaladoc for them.
It just ignores the doc comments.

Many of our Scala codebases have at least some Java in them for various reasons.
It'd be SUPER AWESOME (well, "nice" at least) if Scaladoc could generate full documentation for these
mixed codebases, including all doc comments.

It appears this was added briefly by Donna in r22605, then reverted in r22619.

That sounds like you're trying to generate Scaladoc from _Javadoc_ comments in Java sources.

What I had in mind was to generate Scaladoc from _Scaladoc_ comments in Java sources.

I'm sure there are advantages both ways. But a huge advantage of the latter approach is that I would think it would be easier to do, since Scaladoc already understands Scaladoc format, but doesn't know the Javadoc format.

Without going back and looking, I'm not sure which approach r22605 actually took.
