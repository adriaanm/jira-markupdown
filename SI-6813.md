Following pattern match:

```scala
scala> import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> Flag.IMPLICIT match { case f: FlagSet => "flag"; case l: Long => "long" }
warning: there were 1 unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
res2: String = long
```

Should return "flag". Class tag (FlagSetTag) is imported and in scope so it looks like pattern matching bug.
```scala
type FlagSet = Long
```
It would sure be news to me if the pattern matcher had any chance of distinguishing "FlagSet" from "Long".
Hey guys. I think I just ran into this one too with a new case, or at least one that hasn't been explicitly mentioned yet. 

In short: I'm getting the dreaded warning when using a subtype of an object that I have aliased in a pattern match, which in my case involves an `unapplySeq` call. Real world code snippet:

```scala
case Path.Segment(prefix, tail) â‡’ ...
```

where `Path` is a type alias defined in a package object as:

```scala
  type Path = spray.http.Uri.Path
  val Path = spray.http.Uri.Path
```

Any progress on this issue?

Scala version: 2.11.6
