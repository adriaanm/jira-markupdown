Looks like the situation before this commit was pretty messed up: if we enabling `-Ytyper-debug` we actually SOE as well. This suggests that we are catching and recovering from the SOE elsewhere. All if which is pretty reminiscent of scala/bug#6685 (which was probably worth it for the classic "I feel like showering with lye." reaction: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1684

Diffing the -Ytyper-debug output from the before and after revisions above yields: https://gist.github.com/retronym/d5c4e292749fe97ae7e2
