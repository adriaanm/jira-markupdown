Attached is a patch to add a `:shortcuts` command to the REPL.  It reads the default bindings file from the `jline.Terminal` for the current reader and prints the comments.  It isn't ideal, but it seemed like the best option.  Because it uses JLine's API, it should be cross-platform, although I haven't tested it.

The patch also modifies the REPL to resolve the ambiguity when one command is a substring of another by selecting the exact match if there is one.  Alternatively, `:shorctuts` could be renamed `:keybindings` or something else that doesn't conflict with `:sh`.

Keybinding mapping for JLine. The format is:
[key code]: [logical operation]
CTRL-B: move to the previous character
CTRL-G: move to the previous word
CTRL-F: move to the next character
CTRL-A: move to the beginning of the line
CTRL-D: close out the input stream
CTRL-E: move the cursor to the end of the line
BACKSPACE, CTRL-H: delete the previous character
8 is the ASCII code for backspace and therefor
deleting the previous character
TAB, CTRL-I: signal that console completion should be attempted
CTRL-J, CTRL-M: newline
CTRL-K: erase the current line
ENTER: newline
CTRL-L: clear screen
CTRL-N: scroll to the next element in the history buffer
CTRL-P: scroll to the previous element in the history buffer
CTRL-R: redraw the current line
CTRL-U: delete all the characters before the cursor position
CTRL-V: paste the contents of the clipboard (useful for Windows terminal)
CTRL-W: delete the word directly before the cursor
DELETE, CTRL-?: delete the previous character
127 is the ASCII code for delete
