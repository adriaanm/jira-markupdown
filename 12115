I always thought the use case was this:

Bob: "Hmm, I need to find that mappy thingy, I know it's in scala somewhere"
[clicks focus on "scala"]
Bob: "It should be part of the collections"
[clicks focus on collections]
Bob: "Alright, I'd like it to be immutable"
[clicks "immutable"]
Bob: "Ah there it is"

So that's why I figured it was implemented like it currently is. Which also legitimises the way focusing on the scala package works. The discrepancy between hide and focus, however, is perhaps somewhat strange.

One idea would be to ask ourselves what we really want focus to do. Should it eliminate the other packages or should it allow us to navigate the library like traversing directories? If the latter, should we call it something else?

Other things we could ask ourselves is, how often is it used - is it better removed? Do people use the search function instead?

You can achieve the same thing by typing `scala.annotation.meta` in the filter-field.
