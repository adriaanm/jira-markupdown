Thanks to Matthew Farwell for minimizing and sending me this issue. It looks  particularly ugly inside the IDE, but it's not specific.

The following file fails compilation after 42 seconds with a 176KB error message:

{code}
package foobar;

import org.scalatest.prop.TableDrivenPropertyChecks._

class PresentationCompilerTest {
  def foobar() = Table((1))
}
{code}

It uses `scalatest`. Use the following `build.sbt` for 2.11.0-M4:

{code}
scalaVersion := "2.11.0-M4"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "2.0.M6-SNAP35" cross CrossVersion.full
{code}

Same outcome with 2.10.2
