The RMI compiler produces errors when processing the classes generated from the source below:
{code}
@remote
trait Hello {
  def sayHello: List[String] // String, Array[String] are ok
}
class HelloImpl extends java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject with Hello {
  private val hostname = java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost.getHostName
  def sayHello: List[String] = List("Hello from "+hostname)
}
{code}
