Agree that `it()` is a lot shorter and would be far less frightening-looking to Java people than `MODULE$$`.

Another advantage of providing a method instead of just a field is that Java has type inference for generic methods. For example, this Java code doesn't compile, since javac doesn't know about declaration-site variance or Nothing:
{code}
scala.Option<String> x = scala.None$$.MODULE$$;
{code}
but this Java code does compile:
{code}
scala.Option<String> x = scala.Option.apply(null);
{code}
because the type inference kicks in (as described at http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/TechnicalDetails.html#FAQ401). I think the inference would also kick in for an it() method. (Wouldn't it? I hope so.)
