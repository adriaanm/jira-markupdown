A few years ago, `Ordered` was made a sub-class of `Comparable`.

One issue remained: `Ordered` used an abstract `compare`, while `Comparable` had an abstract `compareTo`.
This was approached by implementing `compareTo` in `Ordered` in terms of `compare`.

Some issues remain with that solution:

- It is impossible for a class to implement `Ordered` if that class made `compareTo` final. (Example: `java.lang.Enum`)
- It is necessary to implement {{Ordered}}'s {{compare}} again, even if a super-class has a perfectly fine implementation of {{Comparable}}'s {{compareTo}}, which would be sufficient for {{Ordered}}.

Proposed solution:

{{Ordered}} implements {{compare}} in terms of {{Comparable}}'s {{compareTo}}.
A detailed overview of the existing usages will be necessary to figure out the least disruptive way of fixing this issue.
I think we should have a look whether we can alias Ordered to Comparable on the JVM, and add some warning, and let the compiler move the implementation from `compare` to `compareTo` in people's code.
