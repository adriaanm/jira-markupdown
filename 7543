It's not an application but a value context.

If you use parens, to make it a(), it's easy to see how the disambiguation is explicit.

To answer your question, I suppose downstream errors are not considered in overload resolution; though it would be interesting if error messages could be improved to consider them.

Maybe someday:
scalac -Yexplain-overload-resolution -Ydeep-explanations
