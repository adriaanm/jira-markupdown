I think this seems right: often you want to have Scala and Java projects/modules logically grouped into a larger "project" and Scala's preference to use Resource Working Sets (in the New Scala Project Wizard etc.) makes this more complicated.

I think Scala should just use Java working sets.
What problem are you reporting? I use Java working sets with Scala projects all the time. It Just Works.
