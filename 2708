@moors - I hardly think that is a fair comment. You provided an example which was less readable than mine and did not (I feel) adequantely address the problem. I wasn't aware of the other way of expressing this (I've never seen any code use the syntax before, including in the scala library), so hardly realized that I needed "training".

It doesn't seem unreasonable for those less experienced in scala to register and argue for RFE's; I don't entirely appreciate the scolding :-/
