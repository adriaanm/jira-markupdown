=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
def foo[T](a:T, b:T):T = a
def test = foo(ListBuffer(), List()) 
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Type of test is `Seq[Nothing]`

=== What do you see instead? ===

`type mismatch;  found   : scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Nothing]  required: Seq[Nothing]{def companion: scala.collection.generic.GenericCompanion[Seq[Any]]`

=== Additional information ===
```scala
def test = foo(ListBuffer():Seq[Nothing], List()) 
```
Works as expected
```scala
def test = foo[Seq[Nothing]](List(), ListBuffer()) 
```

Works as expected
```scala
trait R[T]
class A[T] extends R[T]
class B[T] extends R[T]

def test = foo(new A(), new B()) 
```

Works as expected: type of test is R[Nothing]
=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
