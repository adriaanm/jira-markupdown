Another comment from Bryan on scala-user:

{code}
The documentation from BasicTransformer for buffer seems inconsistent with
the implementation of it.

  /** Returns a new node buffer with the first <code>pos</code> elements
   *  from <code>ns</code>.
   *
   *  @param pos ..
   *  @param ns  ..
   *  @return    ..
   */
{code}
