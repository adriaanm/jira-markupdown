That sounds painfully optimistic to me.  Even if it were true, it wouldn't make any difference: if we don't work with java, it's our problem no matter where the blame might be pinned.  But I don't think it's true.  Either our signatures/descriptors are wrong/internally-inconsistent or we are missing bridge methods.  I was trying to avoid a new batch of bridge methods when I worked on SI-3452 but maybe they can't be avoided.
