In both the 2.9.1 and the current nightly API doc, methods like {{toString}} and {{##}} that have zero parameter lists are shown as having a single, empty parameter list. That's incorrect; these are distinct method types.

For example toString is shown as: {{def toString (): String}} when it should be simply {{def toString: String}}.
