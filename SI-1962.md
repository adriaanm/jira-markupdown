Given a classfile `A.scala` in the current directory, the compiler finds the classfile for compiling, but the interpreter crashes when running the generated code.

This only happens when the interpreter is launched manually, not through the "scala" shell script.

```scala
$$> java -cp build/pack/lib/scala-library.jar:build/pack/lib/scala-compiler.jar:lib/fjbg.jar scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner

scala> new A()
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: A
        at .<init>(<console>:5)
        at .<clinit>(<console>)
        at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:4)
        at RequestResult$$.<clinit>(<console>)
        at RequestResult$$result(<console>)
        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)
        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImp...
```

This is a bit annoying because it happens when running the interpreter in eclipse.

Adding the following two parameters (as it's done when using the "scala" script) helps:

```scala
-Dscala.home=build/pack -Denv.classpath=
```
You realize "." is not in your classpath, right? It works if you add it.
```scala
$$ java -cp build/pack/lib/scala-library.jar:build/pack/lib/scala-compiler.jar:lib/fjbg.jar:. scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner
Welcome to Scala [...]

scala> new A
res0: A = A@2dd803
```
However there is indeed a bug here, in that there is inconsistency in how the classpath is handled.  I am looking at this along with the whole classloader situation, which is slowly coming into focus.
