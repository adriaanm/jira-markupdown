A number of buffers throw exceptions when you try to remove more elements than exist.  This is not unreasonable, but it needs to be documented.  `ArrayBuffer` and `UnrolledBuffer` throw exceptions; `ListBuffer` does not.  Need to document which do and which don't, or fix all to have a consistent behavior.  Example of exception: {{collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(4,5,6).remove(1,3)}}.  Example of not: {{collection.mutable.ListBuffer(4,5,6).remove(1,3)}}
