The following code causes the compiler to crash. When the @inline annotation is removed, the compiler seems to work ok.

{code:title=Test.scala|borderStyle=solid}
class Test {

  @inline
  private def foo {
      def it {
      }
    List().foreach { _ => it }
  }
}
{code}
This will fix it, but it's a bit too shameful to submit as is:

```
SI-6562 Assume less about the name of the OUTER_LOCAL â€¦
Since 07f9429, the name of this field can be expanded.
Not sure which is the best way around this:

  - avoid expanding synthetic names in `makeNonPrivate`?
  - try with/withou the same expansion in `outerField`?
  - loosen the member lookup `name.endsWith(OUTER_LOCAL)`

For now, I've gone with the last choice.

```scala
         case Select(qual, name) =>
-          /** return closest enclosing method, unless shadowed by an enclosing class;
-           *  no use of closures here in the interest of speed.

             sym.makeNotPrivate(sym.owner)
```

With https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5d4e4e2 (the point of the regression, and a seeming half-reversion of e6b4204604).

```scala
-          if (currentClass != sym.owner)
+          // make not private symbol acessed from inner classes, as well as
+          // symbols accessed from @inline methods
+          if (currentClass != sym.owner ||
+              (sym.owner.enclMethod hasAnnotation ScalaInlineClass))
```

Martin [reasoned](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1121#issuecomment-7700454):

```
@magarciaEPFL: I convinced myself otherwise. The only difference is if we have an @inline method that has a nested
class
...
But in that case the whole discussion is moot anyway because the class does not escape the method. So we can live with the standard @enclMethod code and do not need a new concept.

Unless there are other comments I'd vote on merging this now.
```

Later, the inliner was changed:

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/f71dca29

```
Made inliner work for @inline methods that access private variables.
We need to disable the previous "potentiallyPublished" logic for this because that one disables inlining as long as the inlined method has a reference to a field with a $. But making fields public in @inline method will generate fields with $. We need to complement this with reverting the previous publication logic completely. I leave that to Vlad or Miguel.
```

So we've got the changes to `SuperAccessors`, `ExplicitOuter`, and `Inliners`. It all seems like loose ends in need of a sturdy knot.
Here's my suggestion: 

  https://github.com/retronym/scala/tree/ticket/6562-2

But before submitting a PR, I'm going to try to create a test case for the problem Miguel described:

  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/iPkMCygzws4/hjosnYfLMicJ
Here's a more ambitious version, that removes access widening from `SuperAccessors` altogether.

  https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/2.10.0-wip...ticket/6562-3

I suspect there are subtle issues with binary compatibility if we defer this change to 2.10.1. The assumptions that we have encoded into `Inliners` about what happened earlier in `ExplicitOuter` only hold if the inlinable method and the call site are compiled with the same version of the compiler.

Perhaps we could harden things by validating those assumptions (checking the Java types), or offering the improvements behind a -Y option for use only by people with homogenenously compiled libraries.
The fix looks right to me. Much better to concentrate makeNotPrivate logic in ExplicitOuter. Can you make a pull-request against 2.10.0-wip? Maybe with me and Miguel as reviewers?

Thanks

Unfortunately it isn't fully functional: If the @inline-d method references, for example, a private `var` in an enclosing class, `ExplicitOuter` will expand its name, but the `Inliners` will generate a call to the original name, as it stood at the time of pickling. 

`Inliners` will either have to replicate the `makeNotPrivate` calls (fragile?) or figure out that names are expanded based on the Java signature (major surgery?).

I'll commit the failing test case to the branch tonight to make this clearer.

I'm also worried about references to package-qualified private members of other compilation units. `ExplicitOuter` should only `makeNotPrivate` symbols from the current compilation unit. Some cases work at the moment, as those members are public in bytecode anyway, but I need to write some more tests. Again, the interesting case comes when names are expanded, ie when the referenced symbol is a class/trait member.
Here's the now-breaking test:

  https://github.com/retronym/scala/commit/d6d6ad6

My concern about qualified private members was misplaced: these are already !isPrivate, and as such not subject to the whims of `makeNotPrivate`.
```
Inliners will either have to replicate the makeNotPrivate calls (fragile?) or figure out that names are expanded based on the Java signature (major surgery?).
```

A tentative fix drawn from the fragile basket:

Moved the (serious, IMO) residual issues to #6608
