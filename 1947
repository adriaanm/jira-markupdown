For some reason I've continued to nurse this patch. I attached a new one against current 2.12.x, d30098c30d. It still fails when it comes time to run the usual test suite because of the binary artifacts, but since my last comment a bunch of junit tests have been added and here's where junit really shines: it doesn't have to break the way anything scala will. So all the junit tests pass, and that's as much as I know.

Now I'm deleting the branch.
