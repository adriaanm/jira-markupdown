I used "ant dist" to build a Scala distribution from the 2.7.4 source package, but the README file doesn't explain what to do then.  There doesn't seem to be an "ant install" command or anything.  (To be honest, I have more experience with make than with ant).  Could you add information to the README file about what you do between "building a distribution" and having a working scala installation?
```scala
'ant dist'
  Builds a distribution.
    - Runs all the tests as above (and refuses to build a distribution if it
      fails).
    - Creates a local distribution in 'dists/latest'.
```
I am having trouble seeing how this could be more explicit.

Most of the programs I've compiled from source have had a "make install" option that puts them into /usr/bin or something.  Do I just copy the dists/latest/bin stuff into /usr/bin?  Then again, some of the websites say I should be adding existing things to my paths.  Do I have to do something about manpages?  And how do I make sure that sbaz knows where I've put things?

There are steps between "ant dist" and "scalac <sub>/test.scala" or "emacs </sub>/test.scala".  Many of these steps (manpages, putting executables somewhere) are only a problem because of my basic lack of unix knowledge; putting them into the readme is more courtesy than necessity.  But some of the steps (sbaz, scala-tools, etc.) are scala-specific, and definitely need to be in the documentation.
