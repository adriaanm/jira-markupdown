```scala
object Test {
  type SS = (String,String)
  def x(ss: SS): Int = 3
}
```

Scaladoc shows the `SS` as `()`.
(kzys in [r25393](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25393)) Scaladoc shouldn't drop type arguments to aliased tuple. Related to #4676. Review by pedrofurla.
