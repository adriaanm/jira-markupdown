I attached some patches that apply independently to !ReferencePart.tex in r22028.

1. Update the syntax for functions and removed the restrictions on eta-expansion.
I'm not sure what this part in the Function Types section means, so I left it in:
  In the case of exactly one argument type `T => U` is a shorthand for `(T) => U`.
Looking at the latex source, I think it is supposed to be rendered `(T,) => U`, implying it is `Tuple1[T] => U`.
That syntax is no longer valid however and the spec only specifies tuples for `n >= 2`.
`Tuple1` does still exist in the API docs, though.

2. Add type constructor examples to Parameterized Types section.

Three are cleanup of comments/todo that I don't think are needed anymore:

3. Remove todo for explaining that method values are equal since they aren't (and probably can't be):

{code}
def m(x: Int) = x + 3
val a = m _
val b = m _
println(a == b)
{code}


4. Remove comment on Tuple2 type alias '&:', since it does not exist and I am not aware of any infix alternative.

5. Remove commented section on multiple declarations that have been superseded by the relevant sections on vars/vals.
