Note that the workaround is to call {{slice}} first, before {{remove}}.

I guess if we made this change, the result type ought to match {{slice}}'s result type, so your proposed code change would need some refinement.

It's not a no-brainer that this change is desirable; single-element {{remove}} never needs to allocate, but multi-element {{remove}} would have to allocate. If the return value is usually ignored, then allocating is undesirable.
