The following simple program

{code}
object Main {

    def main (args : Array[String]) {
        val b = new StringBuilder
        b.append ("Hello World!")
        b.lastIndexOf ('e')
        println (b.toString)
    }

}
{code}

prints out

{code}
!dlroW olleH
{code}

when compiled and run with Scala 2.8RC1 (on Mac OS X and Java 1.6).  Everything is fine with 2.8Beta1.

Apparently the lastIndexOf call causes the contents of the builder to be reversed as a side-effect.
