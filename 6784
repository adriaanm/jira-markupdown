Line 155 in file nsc.io.AbstractFile should be changed from

var rest = sizeOption.get

to

var rest = {color:red}sizeOption.getOrElse(0){color}

NB. Among the subsclasses of nsc.io.AbstractFile (aka. PlainFile, VirtualDirectory, VirtualFile, ZipArchive) only class VirtualDirectory doesn't override method sizeOption which in that case returns None.

Can I do the change or has anybody an argument against it ?!
