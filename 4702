The discussion of {{range}} above touches general library design issues.  I was first looking for a way to get the next entry after a given one, or enumerate an interval between two entries.  I was then surprised to see the full {{range}} operation that does the job together with {{toStream}}.  Later I became more ambitious and started using {{range}} more agressively to tune my application, which is here BTW: http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/a4a465dc89d9/src/Pure/PIDE/markup_tree.scala#l59

From a user's point of view, I would say plain enumeration of ranges would be fine as a start ...
