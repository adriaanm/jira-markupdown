This is a mirror of IDE-side issue [#1000937](https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000937#/activity/ticket:).

Create a project with one (feature, deprecation, ...) warning, eg a case class without a parameter list (rather than a case object, or a case class with () for the parameter list):
case class Something

That causes one warning, which is displayed in the problems view as:
"there were 1 deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details live-chat Unknown Scala Problem"

This should be:
"There was 1 deprecation warning; re-run ..."
