This error is so simple, the following little program says it all:

/* Produces surprising results as it prints "a: 0". Seems it should
either produce a compilation error or print "a: 33". */

object DclOrderBug {

  val a = b

  val b = 33

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("a: " + a)
  }

}
This is as specified.  See SI-399 among lots of other stuff.
