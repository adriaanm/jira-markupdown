s/wrong number of args/too many args/

You get an error if there are not enough args, since the varargs don't align. That is true in general.

The Elem object serves as an extractor for Nodes, which have no notion of minimizeEmpty.

(That extractor tripped someone else up recently, so maybe that's a design issue.)

It might make a nice Abide rule to warn about this sort of thing.

Or maybe a compiler lint option to warn about "splitting" a varargs. Is that a general issue? Maybe only when mixing args and varargs.

scala> val r = "(a*)(b*)(c*)".r
r: scala.util.matching.Regex = (a*)(b*)(c*)

scala> "abc" match { case r(as, rest @ _*) => as }  // dangerous?
res5: String = a

scala> "abc" match { case r(as, _, _) => as }
res6: String = a
