It seems the compiler does not pick up references to other projects in the new eclipse plugin. Here's what I tried:

1. Create a new project server with an empty class server.C in it. I see
```scala
project server
  src
    server
      C
```
2. Create a new project client with an application program 
```scala
package client

object Test {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    new server.C
  }
}
```

3. Mark server as project referenced by client in clients Property dialog.

4. Do a clean build of both projects. 

I get: ``not found: value server_

I am running 3.3.1.1 on Windows.
