Would `$Coll` would update as per the current API someone is looking. For example, in case of List, List will be shown but in case of Set, Set will be displayed?
```

It certainly looks that way to me — seems worth a try.
```
is there a way to validate by generating documentation locally?
```

yes, `ant docs.lib` will generate the doc for the standard library into `build/scaladoc/library`
