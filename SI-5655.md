Following code causes it to give error. Not sure if this is a bug or a feature

```
scala> object x { def x={} }
defined module x

scala> import x._
import x._

scala> exit
<console>:7: error: not found: value x
import x._
       ^

scala> 1
<console>:7: error: not found: value x
import x._
       ^
```
Note that the proper way to exit REPL is `:quit` or `:q`. Usually, `exit` will work, though I have noticed it doesn't when REPL was started from SBT.

I can reproduce the error, at any rate, also on Windows (Vista 64), with a somewhat old version of trunk.
