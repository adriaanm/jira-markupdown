ListBuffer can retain a reference in last0 to a former element of the ListBuffer, even when that element is removed. For example, VisualVM shows that a ListBuffer has len 0, but last0 still points to an element that has been removed from the ListBuffer.
This causes problematic memory leaks in my application.

This suggests that the problem occurs when calling clear() and -=
