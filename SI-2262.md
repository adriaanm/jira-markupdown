In Scala 2.7.5 the compiler does not use one of my implicit functions.

Added defect code as attachment. 
The package {{scala.collection.jcl}} is no longer supported, in the upcoming version 2.8.0, the collection library has been completely re-written. Some replacements for jcl are available in the object {{scala.collection.Conversions}}.

If you have a test case against a current nightly build (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/212/distributions) please re-open the ticket.
