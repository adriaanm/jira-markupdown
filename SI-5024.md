The pattern matcher strips unused bindings, which is good, but this alters the behavior w.r.t #1503, which is not so good.  I need to record what bindings were stripped and type the RHS accordingly.
Possibly not - in fact with a less horrendous pattern matcher it may not even be necessary/desirable to strip the bindings. But more importantly, I just discovered #1503 isn't fixed at all.
This sequence went "true, true, false" when this ticket was opened. Now it goes "true, true, true". Unfortunately it's supposed to go "true, false, false". So the bug has moved - it is no longer that unused bindings are stripped, but that they don't appear to be considered at all, at least not based on this example. I know that #1503 remains unfixed so it's not like they were being adequately considered before either.
```scala
scala> val s: Seq[Nothing] = Vector.empty
s: Seq[Nothing] = Vector()

scala> s match { case Nil => true ; case _ => false }
res0: Boolean = true

scala> s match { case x@Nil => true ; case _ => false }
res1: Boolean = true

scala> s match { case x@Nil => {x; true} ; case _ => false }
<console>:9: warning: a pure expression does nothing in statement position; you may be omitting necessary parentheses
              s match { case x@Nil => {x; true} ; case _ => false }
                                       ^
res2: Boolean = true
```
```scala
scala> s match { case x@Nil => {x.::(""); true} ; case _ => false }
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.immutable.Vector cannot be cast to scala.collection.immutable.List
	at .<init>(<console>:9)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:7)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at $print(<console>)
```
That's a regression from -Xoldpatmat:
```scala
scala> val s: Seq[Nothing] = Vector.empty
s: Seq[Nothing] = Vector()

scala> s match { case x@Nil => {x.::(""); true} ; case _ => false }
res0: Boolean = false
```
There's a test ostensibly for #1503, but it's not a good test.
That's the point, it shouldn't typecheck. We know that with fairly high confidence due to the ClassCastException it is presently throwing after it successfully typechecks.
So then we can fix this and #1503, right?

We know that if this variable is used under this unsound assumption, the code will always fail at run-time.
If the variable does not occur, or its type need not be the unsound type, it will continue to work.

I don't see how this is going to break existing code **that worked at run-time** -- do we care about time bombs that type checked but could never work?

Lest you think I'm being overly defensive, I'm reacting to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-1503?focusedCommentId=43564&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-43564
Changing this would cause weaker types to be inferred for case bodies, which would cause weaker types for matches, which would cause weaker types for expressions, which would cause weaker types for methods. This in turn would impact everything: implicit resolution, overloading selection, overrides, conformance, on and on. All of that happens regardless of whether the potentially unsound case body is ever reached at runtime. It could be the world's least sound case body, but if the pattern never matches then it is a tree falling in a forest where everyone has lost their ears to the plague and doesn't care about trees. At least, it is until we make it not compile anymore.

None of that means we shouldn't fix it, and I don't have any reason to believe it's going to hit that many places in the wild, I'm just answering the question.

If you're thinking on this matter, this would be a great time to look at the ticket I was bugging you about a month ago, #785. And at my implementation of much of what's in it, https://github.com/paulp/scala/commit/4bd8ad6ae5 .
And on #1503, I don't have a clear picture of this even being a distinct bug from #1503. It was in the old matcher because during a period of implementation desperation I wrote code to strip unused bindings. But from a theoretical standpoint there's no reason to do that.
I have to run, but the only code ant strap.done could find that's affected by my patch is in GenTypes. I had to turn it into:

```scala
      case tpe : NoType.type =>
        reifyMirrorObject(tpe)
      case tpe : NoPrefix.type =>
        reifyMirrorObject(tpe)
```

Proposed patch: https://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commits/ticket-5024

I'm not sure we should do this in 2.10.1, but slightly in favor.
consolidating with #1503
