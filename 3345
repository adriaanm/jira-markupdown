> it is possible to call A with parameters of type `(AnyRef, Seq[AnyRef])` thanks to tuple conversion, `Tuple2[AnyRef, Seq[AnyRef]]` conforms to `AnyRef`. So B is as specific as A.

It's wrong. The Scala Language Specification never said {{AnyRef*}} can be treated as {{Seq[AnyRef]}} when resolving overloaded methods.
