It's a tradeoff:
# Given unchanged source code, the inliner is doing its job alright.
# Assuming the body of {{Vector.canBuildFrom}} is rewritten (into what?) then the pros and cons of its inlining could be weighed. 
# Removing the {{@inline}} annotation is another option. In this case, invocations at points where {{VectorReusableCBF}} is also accessible lose their inlining ability. (I haven't checked whether there are any).

That's a design discussion, suitable for the mailing list, not this bug ticket, I think.
