I see I didn't attach the source to the ticket way back when, but since it's still not fixed maybe I'd better.  This is a soundness bug: here is CCE inducing source.
```scala
// example mostly by DRMacIver, prettified a bit by paulp
object o {
  trait X { type T; def t: T; def doStuff(t : T): Unit }
  var stuff: X = new X { 
    type T = String
    def t = "abc"
    def doStuff(t: String) = ()
  }
  
  // here is the hole: x will now be treated as a stable identifier
  // even though the actual implementation of it is a def, because
  // structural types don't perform the necessary override checks
  val evil: { val x: X } = new { def x = stuff }
  
  // t is a String
  val t = evil.x.t
  
  // replace "stable" id with method which thinks t is an Int
  stuff = new X {
     type T = Int
     def t = 21
     def doStuff(t : Int) = ()
  }

  // oh noes!
  def cce() = evil.x.doStuff(t)
}
```
