I made a small typo in a case class, putting a close parens before the argument list. I guess Scala's error recovery is pretty good here, but this seems like a spurious warning.

{code}

scala> case class Foo)(xs: Int)
<console>:1: warning: case classes without a parameter list have been deprecated;
use either case objects or case classes with `()' as parameter list.
       case class Foo)(xs: Int)
                     ^
<console>:1: error: ';' expected but ')' found.
       case class Foo)(xs: Int)
                     ^
{code}
