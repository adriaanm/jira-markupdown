Compile the following program with -Xprint:typer -Ycheck:typer. 

```scala
class C {
  def f(v: => Int, b: Boolean = true) = 0
}

object t {
  (new C).f(1)
}
```

You'll get an error at the check phase.
```

[...]

    {
      val qual$1: C = new C();
      val x$1: () => Int(1) = (() => 1);
      val x$2: Boolean = qual$1.f$default$2;
      qual$1.f(1, x$2)
    }
  }
}

[Now checking: typer]
test.scala:6: error: 
**** ERROR DURING INTERNAL CHECKING ****
type mismatch;
 found   : () => Int
 required: () => Int(1)
  (new C).f(1)
            ^

new-host:sandbox luc$ 
```

The problem is that there is a closure generated 
```scala
      val x$1: () => Int(1) = (() => 1);
```
which is not typable (because of the constant type in the result type). The closure is also useless, it will never be called. If you write a closure such as 
```scala
()=> 34
```
the problem does not arise; the return type is Int, instead of Int(34).
