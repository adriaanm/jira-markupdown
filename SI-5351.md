Given my own usage, I'd like to see a definition like this in the standard library:

```scala
def groupInto[B, C](toKey: A => B)(toValue: A => C): Map[B, Seq[C]] = this groupBy toKey map { case (k, vs) => k -> vs.toSeq map toValue }
```

To check whether this method was useful enough, I checked Scala sources. Out of 29 uses of groupBy, five where followed by mapValues on the same line, and two followed by a map that does the same thing. That's just short of 25%, which I think is pretty good.

There are two clear differences in the semantics betweep groupBy + mapValues and what I'm asking for. First, mapValues returns a view (in all but name), and, second, groupBy returns the value type as Repr. The two groupBy+map uses actually get the same results I'm asking for (well, maybe except for Seq -- they both deal in parallels, so perhaps GenSeq would be required).
Of course, I'd like an *optimized* version of the method. The above definition is just for semantics.
Here's mine!

```scala
  /**
   * Like {@link scala.collection.Traversable#groupBy} but lets you return both the key and the value for the resulting
   * Map-of-Lists, rather than just the key.
   *
   * @param in the input list
   * @param f the function that maps A's in the input list to a (K,V) tuple for the output map.
   * @tparam A the type of elements in the source list
   * @tparam K the type of the first element of the tuple returned by the function; will be used as keys for the result
   * @tparam V the type of the second element of the tuple returned by the function; will be used as values for the result
   * @return a Map-of-Lists
   */
  def groupBy2[A,K,V](in: Traversable[A])(f: PartialFunction[A,(K,V)]): Map[K,Seq[V]] = {
    in.foldLeft(Map[K,Seq[V]]().withDefaultValue(Vector[V]())) { (map, a) â‡’
      if (f.isDefinedAt(a)) {
        val (b,c) = f(a)
        map.updated(b, map(b) :+ c)
      } else {
        map
      }
    }
  }
```
How would you guys feel like this as an alternative, on MapLike.  (It could be more general, this is a prototype.) It does less, but more straightforwardly, and it covers the main thing I find myself doing repeatedly.  The collections mostly stick to functions with one non-implicit argument and I think that's a good thing.
```scala
  /** Returns a new immutable map, the keys of which are the unique values
   *  resulting from applying the given function to each of the keys of this
   *  map, and the values of which are sequences containing the
   *  corresponding values.  If there is an implicit Ordering available
   *  for the value type, the sequences will be sorted according to it;
   *  otherwise they are in arbitrary order.
   *
   *  @param    f   a function from old key type to new key type
   *  @return   a Map from the new key type to a sequence of values
   *  @example  Map(1 -> "a", 2 -> "b", 3 -> "c").groupValuesBy(_ % 2) == Map(0 -> Seq("b"), 1 -> Seq("a", "c"))
   */
  def groupValuesBy[C, B1 >: B, That](f: A => C)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[This, (C, immutable.Seq[B1]), That], ord: Ordering[B1] = null): That = {
    val m = mutable.Map[C, List[B1]]() withDefaultValue Nil
    for ((k, v) <- self)
      m(f(k)) ::= v
    
    val b = bf()
    if (ord eq null)
      b ++= m
    else for ((k, vs) <- m)
      b += ((k, vs.sorted))

    b.result
  }
{
```
I would advise caution here. The collection libraries are already very large. Making them larger does not necessarily new friends us make. 25% of use cases for a semi-popular method like groupBy is for me under the threshold for an addition. 

Besides, I would really value some stability in the collection libraries. Let's spend our energy to working on I/O, concurrency, async. There's a whole world out here that needs out attention more than this.
