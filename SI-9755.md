I faced pretty strange annotations-related behavior (bug?) with scala macro. Its pretty hard to describe it in one message so I decided to create a sample repo to show it.

https://github.com/akozhemiakin/sandbox-one

In brief, here is the test itself:

{code:scala}
package sandbox

import org.scalatest.FunSuite
import sandbox.sub.B

class SandboxSpec extends FunSuite {
  class A[T](el: T)

  test("Test 1") {
    // Here we use simple macro to return number of annotations attached to the "foo" method of the A type arg
    assert(Macro.annosOnFoo(new A(new C)) == 1) // Will succeed
  }

  test("Test 2") {
    // Exactly the same case as above. The only difference: B is not in the same package as A and this test
    assert(Macro.annosOnFoo(new A(new B)) == 1) // Will fail
  }
}
{code}

So the problem is, that in the second case scala does not see any annotations attached to the target method.

I did my best to find some similar issue but did not succeed, hope it is not a duplicate.
In sbt, it fails after clean, then succeeds subsequently (on editing the test file). I see the same behavior using a Java annotation or ClassfileAnnotation, and also after putting the macro and test in different subprojects.
