Added a byte code comparison the with working version (where the type alias is manually dealiased to {{E\[A with B with C\]}}) to https://gist.github.com/b-studios/e06f741434b2119ed0f2

The main difference is that the following method implementation is generated for the working version, while it isn't for the version with {{E\[F with C\]}}:

{code}
public java.lang.Object id(java.lang.Object);
  Code:
     0: aload_0       
     1: aload_1       
     2: checkcast     #27                 // class E
     5: invokevirtual #29                 // Method id:(LE;)LE;
     8: areturn 
{code}
