The MANIFEST.MF in scala-compiler.jar (scala-2.7.0-final) is invalid. This prevents the JAR from being used as an OSGi bundle.

The offending header is as follows:

Import-Package: org.apachge.ant.tools;version="[1.6",org.apachge.ant.t
 ools.taskdefs;version="[1.6",org.apachge.ant.types;version="[1.6",org
 .apachge.ant.tools.util;version="[1.6",org.xml.sax

There are two problems here: the typo "apachge", and the syntax of the version range. If you are looking for a version range string that matches 1.6.x, try "[1.6.0,1.7.0)". This will match anything from version 1.6.0 inclusive to 1.7.0 exclusive.

May I also suggest marking the Ant dependencies as optional, using the directive "resolution:=optional".
