Now that this is fixed it may be unimportant, but since I've made the measurements, I'll drop them here even if just for the record:

**ant clean quick.lib**

With the optimization in my 10:35pm message:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.938 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:49.082 sec]

With copyTypeRef(pre,sym,args) just an alias for typeRef(pre,sym,args):
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:54.058 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:49.825 sec]

With the optimization guarded by "eq" on all three parameters:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.777 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.518 sec]

... not even measurable difference... 

**ant clean quick.comp:**

With the optimization guarded by "eq" on all three parameters:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.412 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer: 3:14.034 sec]
Total time: 7 minutes 7 seconds

With the snippet above:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:50.794 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer: 3:12.194 sec]
Total time: 7 minutes 5 seconds

With copyTypeRef just calling typeRef -- and making it final:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:50.895 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer: 3:13.251 sec]
Total time: 7 minutes 6 seconds

... again, not really measurable.

I'll try the fix and see what it brings (right now my build is broken :-( )
