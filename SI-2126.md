I wrote a small benchmark (attached) to compare performance of actor.receive vs. actor.react.

With scala 2.7.2-final (windows):

- using the receive allows max. 255 actors, otherwise the remaining actors are not "processed" by the scheduler (??) - see output

- react works OK

With scala 2.7.5-final (windows):

- "receive" method does not decrease the number of "processed actors" (sounds strange, but read source code first) after 1 or 2 

- "react" still works fast, but SLOWER than in 2.7.2, especially if actors are started after sending message.

I used Intellij IDEA with scala "optimize" compiler flag.


I don't think this is a bug.

If you want to use more than 256 "receive" actors active at the same time, then you need to increase the maximum size of the thread pool by specifying -Dactors.maxPoolSize=X, with X greater or equal to the number of active receive-based actors you want.

I think the performance difference between 2.7.(2, 3, 4) and 2.7.5 is expected.  In pre-2.7.5 versions, start tasks associated with new actors spawned by other actors and tasks resulting from messages sends from actors would bypass the central task queue and be placed directly on the current work thread's queue.  Task stealing was used to allow idle workers to take tasks out of the queues of busy workers.  This was eliminated in 2.7.5 due to bugs.  I think it will be coming back in 2.8.

_then you need to increase the maximum size of the thread pool by specifying -Dactors.maxPoolSize=X, with X greater or equal to the number of active receive-based actors you want._

Thanks, good to know - where should I have found this in the documentation?

However, in my opinion sth is wrong: when I run the "receive"-version in 2.7.5, there is simply no progress even with only few actors, while the "react" version works fine - see the log or just try it. Or did I misunderstood some other fundamental difference between receive and react?

I agree with Erik's analysis. I am closing this ticket now as invalid, since no updated test case was submitted in the meantime.
