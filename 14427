At least two untrue claims about Booleans in the SLS:
{code}
The test x .asInstanceOf[T ] is treated specially if T is a numeric value type 
(�12.2. In this case the cast will be translated to an application of a conversion 
method x.toT (�12.2.1). For non-numeric values x the operation will raise a 
ClassCastException. 
{code}
This would be undesirable if true, but fortunately it isn't.  Neither boolean values nor () throw a CCE if cast to AnyRef.
{code}
The hashCode method returns 1 when invoked on true, and 
0 when invokend on false.
{code}
Those hashCodes would be suboptimal choices, but we can't choose the hashCodes for java.lang.Boolean anyway.  They are:
{code}
scala> (true.hashCode, false.hashCode)
res0: (Int, Int) = (1231,1237)
{code}
