=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
  0.0 to 1 by 0.2
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Under Scala 2.8.1 this acts as shown:
```scala
scala> 0.0 to 1 by 0.2
res32: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Double] = NumericRange(0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0)
```

It gets the values as you might want, but not as you would get if you added 0.2 to 0.0 repeatedly!

However, this has been the way it operated to date.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Under Scala 2.9.0.RC4 it acts as shown:
```scala
scala> 0.0 to 1 by 0.2
res14: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange[Double] = NumericRange(0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6000000000000001, 0.8, 1.0)
```

Double precision issues come into play consistent with adding the numbers but inconsistent with `NumericRange` in Scala 2.8.1

=== Additional information ===

There appears to be a history of issues with Range implementation of which this is one ticket: #3232 but none of the tickets appear to specifically address this issue.

It might be quite reasonable to view the new behaviour of 2.9 as a bugfix to 2.8.1 however it is at least important to flag this for those moving from 2.8.1 to 2.9 as it can have some unanticipated side effects particularly if you are stupid enough to use the Decimal as a Map key!

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC4
  - Java: 1.6
  - Operating system: Mac OS 10.6
On further examination I notice that the 2.8.1 behaviour was entirely intentional as indicated by the comment in the 2.8.1 code
[https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/Range.scala]:
```scala
  // Double works by using a BigDecimal under the hood for precise
  // stepping, but mapping the sequence values back to doubles with
  // .doubleValue.  This constructs the BigDecimals by way of the
  // String constructor (valueOf) instead of the Double one, which
  // is necessary to keep 0.3d at 0.3 as opposed to
  // 0.299999999999999988897769753748434595763683319091796875 or so.
```

So I guess the 2.9.0 behaviour is a regression.
Here's an additional test to patch into `test/files/run/range.scala` to test this:
```scala
  def precisionForDoubles() = {
     // SI-4566
     val r = (0.0 to 1 by 0.2)
     val r2 = (BigDecimal(0.0) to 1 by 0.2).map(_.toDouble)
     assert(r sameElements r2)
  }
```

Okay, I've looked at the code and it appears to be assuming that importing the implicit `Integral[Double]` methods in `DoubleAsIfIntegral`:

```scala
  trait DoubleAsIfIntegral extends DoubleIsConflicted with Integral[Double] {
    def quot(x: Double, y: Double): Double = (BigDecimal(x) / BigDecimal(y)).doubleValue
    def rem(x: Double, y: Double): Double = (BigDecimal(x) remainder BigDecimal(y)).doubleValue
  }
```

 will enable `BigDecimal` precision on the `NumericRange` `foreach` definition:

```scala
  override def foreach[U](f: T => U) {
    var count = 0
    var current = start
    while (count < length) {
      f(current)
      current += step
      count += 1
    }
  }
```

But Integral does not have any impact on addition and therefore does nothing here.

I hope this is helpful to someone as I'm mostly guessing now!
Alex, since you recently fixed #5857 here, maybe you could have a look? If not, please assign to community.
