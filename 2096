more precisely, the annotation gets copied from the primary constructor of {{class User}} to the factory method in {{object User}}, the result looks like the following (and obviously doesn't compile):

{code}
object User {
  def apply(@Column(name="uid") username: String) = { ... }
}
import javax.persistence._
class User {
  @Column(name="uid") val username: String
  def this(@Column(name="uid") username: String) { ... }
}
{code}
