As of https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/28483739c3 this infers different types with and without -Xoldpatmat:

{code}
% scala210
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_10).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def f[T](xs: Set[T]) = xs collect { case x => x }
f: [T](xs: Set[T])scala.collection.immutable.Set[_ <: T]
{code}

{code}
% scala210 -Xoldpatmat
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_10).

f: [T](xs: Set[T])scala.collection.immutable.Set[T]
{code}

It's a large change not to be mentioned in the commit message - is it unintentional? I assume it's not intentional that it's in one pattern matcher and not the other.

    restore typedMatchAnonFun in all its glory
    
    detect partialfunction in cpsannotationchecker
    emit apply/isDefinedAt if PF has @cps targs (applyOrElse can't be typed)
    further hacky improvements to selective anf
    better try/catch support in selective cps using freshly minted anonfun match
    make virtpatmat resilient to scaladoc (after uncurry, don't translate matches
     TODO: factor out translation all together so presentation compiler/scaladoc can skip it)
Here's an example of the consequences - this works in 2.9.2, but in 2.10:
{code}
scala> List(1).flatMap(n => Set(1).collect { case w => w })
<console>:8: error: no type parameters for method flatMap: (f: Int => scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[List[Int],B,That])That exist so that it can be applied to arguments (Int => scala.collection.immutable.Set[_ <: Int])

<console>:8: error: Cannot construct a collection of type That with elements of type B based on a collection of type List[Int].
              List(1).flatMap(n => Set(1).collect { case w => w })
                             ^
{code}

Please take a look at my comments in SI-5189 before we throw any more code at the problem.
also wanted to quote Jason's (more general) comments from scala-internals on the matter:

I was thinking about the way we synthesize the pattern matching partial functions some more, and was struck by (thankfully unjustified) fear about what happens in:

  object X { val pf: PartialFunction[Any, Any] = { case _ => this } }

Serendipitously, the chicken/egg problem prevents us unhygenically binding `this` to the partial function:

  // should use the DefDef for the context's tree, but it doesn't exist yet (we need the typer we're creating to create it)
  val methodBodyTyper = newTyper(context.makeNewScope(context.tree, methodSym))
  ...
  val match_ = methodBodyTyper.typedMatch(gen.mkUnchecked(selector), cases, mode, ptRes)

The This node carries the symbol for `Test`, even after the anon class is lifted out, which works out fine but was prompted me to double take before I'd reached for -Xprint-types.

  // cases.head.body.expr
  // this{Test.type}.=={(x$1: AnyRef)Boolean}(Test{Test.type}){Boolean}

Any local classes/methods defined in the case body do have correct parentage: the second argument to `makeNewScope` provides the method symbol, which is ready for children.
