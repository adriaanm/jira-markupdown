Can somebody mention in which revision this change got commited?
I've now corrected my imports but I get an internal-compiler error still (using r18445) and I'm wondering if it's related to this somehow.
{code}
[INFO] Compiling 593 source files to /home/andreak/dev/officenet_origo/trunk/origo-core/target/classes

        at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Implicits$$class.inferImplicit(Implicits.scala:59)

(Yes, I know it's impossible to help me based on this stack-trace but I'm providing it just to inform what kind of error occurs...)

It's working fine with my corrected imports using r18350
