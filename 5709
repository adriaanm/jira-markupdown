I see that I already tried to play defense against this.
```scala
  // we'd like to default to no positioning, but for now we break
  // less by defaulting to status quo.
  def withPositioning(on: Boolean): this.type = {
    positioner = if (on) new Positioner else NoPositioner
    this
  }
```
So "source withPositioning false" will make the problem go away.
