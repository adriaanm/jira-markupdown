It seems `isSealed` is not working at runtime. At least, it doesn't work for `List`:

```scala

Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20120808-025516-c0d5f0aadd (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import reflect.runtime.universe._
import reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> typeOf[List]
<console>:11: error: type List takes type parameters

scala> res2.asClass
res3: reflect.runtime.universe.ClassSymbol = class List

scala> res3.isSealed
res4: Boolean = false
```

upd. This also plagues annotation-getting methods as described in #6428. In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that privateWithin is also affected.
I don't know how to deliver this bit of news, other than to say that I hope you're impressed at the few things we do manage to fix in such a hostile environment.  That we are on the verge of exporting this behavior into userland is not something I can bear to consider.
```
scala> import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> val sym = typeOf[scala.collection.immutable.List[_]].typeSymbol.asClass
sym: reflect.runtime.universe.ClassSymbol = class List

scala> sym.isSealed
res0: Boolean = false

scala> { sym.typeSignature ; () }

scala> sym.isSealed
res2: Boolean = true
```
And here was I saying Symbols were immutable at runtime (**despite** your presentation -- Eugene was very emphatic on them being immutable at runtime, when he reviewed my blog post saying otherwise).

Other than that, I've been impressed for a long time, and I think you understate the case when you say "few".
