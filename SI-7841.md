 - PartialFunction is specialized against AnyRef, even though support for that was removed
 - This leads to specialized type parameters named 'T1$sp'

```
          abstract <specialized> class AbstractPartialFunction$mcZL$sp[T1$sp <: AnyRef] extends this.AbstractPartialFunction[T1$sp,Boolean] {
            <specialized> def <init>($outer: <$anon: Object>): this.AbstractPartialFunction$mcZL$sp[T1$sp] = {
  ~/code/scala qbin/scala -Xprint:all -e 'abstract class AbstractPartialFunction[@specialized(AnyRef)  -T1, @specialized +R] extends Function1[T1, R]' | egrep 'T1\$sp'
```

 - Such names run afoul of the parsing in `unspecializedName` and `splitSpecializedNames`
 - They create subNames with negatives lengths; newTermName doesn't complain
 - Name table corruption appears to follow: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/ZtEdwDwEn4U

Course of action:

 - harden name table against negative length names
 - harden unspecializedName / splitSpecializedName against unexpected names that end in "$sp" (they might not be ours; Android spits out some strange class file names)
 - automatically remove AnyRef from the list of specialized variants (and warn accordingly)
