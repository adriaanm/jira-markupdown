See the following paste.  It appears that the inlining of case class constructors/deconstructors fails to invoke the constructor for the companion object, which is counter to the specification.


Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0.rdev-4009-2011-12-13-g6912ff8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_29).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :paste

case class Test(a: Int)

  println("here")
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Test

Spec 5.4 says

bq. The new {{m$cls}} constructor is evaluated not at the point of the object definition, but is instead evaluated the first time m is dereferenced during execution of the program (which might be never at all). 
Cheap workaround:
{code}
case class Shu(value: Int) { Shu }
{code}
Less cheap:
{code}
case class Ma(value: Int)(implicit dummy: Ma.type = Ma)
{code}

I noticed that the transform is done in RefChecks, and it's so simple and clean that you want to spec it and say Test(42) is a sweetened new Test(42).

But I also see that simple sugars are unhealthy:
{code}
case class Zi private (value: Int)
object Test { 
  //val z2 = new Zi(19) // obviously not
  val z = Zi(17)  // error: constructor Zi in class Zi cannot be accessed in object Test
} 
{code}
I see I can't supply a custom non-synthetic apply to short-circuit the optimization either; the spec does say that you can roll your own copy method.


I've looked at the bytecode emitted with and without {{-optimize}}, for each of the scenarios below:
# {{Test}} is a {{case class}}
  {{Test(42)}} 
  Outcome: doesn't invoke the companion object's constructor
# {{Test}} is a non-case {{class}}
  {{new Test(42)}} 
  Outcome: doesn't invoke the companion object's constructor

Now, let's turn this around. Instead of having me show the above is per-spec, can you provide a counter-argument? Which place in the spec mentions the above should behave differently?


"Test(42)" should be semantically equivalent to "val t = Test; t.apply(42)".  Or, equivalently, "val t = Test; val x = t.x; t.apply(42)".  If x is free of side-effects, then *all* of these should be semantically equivalent.  However, the first one will fail to invoke the companion object constructor, while the third (and I believe the second) will.
My proposed fix for SI-4859 stopped just short of fixing this problem, but it shows all the places that need to be touched when we decide to do so.
Another example. This stems from use of {{isExprSafeToInline}} in {{Erasure#unbox1}}.
