Now that people realize LOC is not a measure of productivity, they want to eliminate as much code as possible by marking it `@elidable`.

The compiler should not crash and then possibly attempt something sensible.

```scala
import annotation._

class X {
  @elidable(100)
  def x() = 42
}
@elidable(500)
class Y {
  def y() = 17
}
class Z {
  @elidable(500)
  val z = 17
}

object Test extends App {
  Console println new X().x()
  Console println new Y().y()
  Console println new Z().z
}
```
As reported http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28923437/scala-elidable-causes-compiler-to-crash
I missed the chance to use the punning test name `FÃ¼rElide`. That's punning on the Beethoven tune the kids play.
