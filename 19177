next code:
```scala
object A {
  val init = println("hello")
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val a = A.init
  }
}
```

produces no output, but "hello" is expected.
This behaviour was observed when trying code described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24221601/scala-object-initialization
