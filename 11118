Cool :)

Actually, this wasn't so much about the annotation but more about the optimization itself. It turns out one part of the bug (If condition) was already introduced in the original introduction of tailcall optimization in 2005:
```scala
commit b4ba0b8045dc81357d4124b4913db0531665e54e
Author: Iulian Dragos <jaguarul@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 28 08:52:00 2005 +0000

    Added tail call elimination phase to nsc.
```

and the other part (left operand of && / ||) was added in 2007:
```scala
commit a694dd57cc8e0dadd3a1b7ec30a18dc4739c16f0
Author: Iulian Dragos <jaguarul@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Mar 19 17:46:30 2007 +0000

    Catch tail calls made from tail boolean or.
```

So much for the history...

The fix was merged as https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3832
