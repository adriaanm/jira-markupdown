A better solution than to rely on manual instruction could be to change the normalisation in .gitattributes

Currently it has 

- text=auto

which will set all files to auto text, meaning on check out it converts all line endings to core.eol, and on check in convert all line endings to lf. For anyone who has core.eol set to anything but lf that would spell trouble.

I'm no git wizard, but shouldn't changing that line to 

- eol=lf

do the trick? If it does, it seems like a better solution than to tell all windows users to config their core.eol for this repo.

In response to Jasons nitpick: The *-windows.tmpl files (as well as .cmd and .bat) are already set to eol=crlf in .gitattributes
