I've attached a code sample which fails to compile. In it I override filter on Iterable with an abstract definition claiming to return a subtype of Iterable. This fails to compile with the error message

{code}
error overriding method filter;
 method filter in trait Iterable of type (((T, T)) => Boolean)Iterable[(T, T)] has incompatible type ((A) => Boolean)Iterable[A]
trait Foo[T] extends Iterable[(T, T)]{
{code}

However, the second two traits defined in this file exhibit the same overriding pattern and work fine. Additionally, if I add an implementation (say = error("foo")) to the definition of filter in Foo, the type error goes away. 
This distills to:

{code}
trait Super[A] { def foo: Super[A] = new Super[A] {} }
trait Sub[A] extends Super[A] { override def foo: Sub[A] }
{code}



Or actually, I'm just too used to having type parameters. It just distills to:

{code}
trait Super { def foo: Super = new Super {} }
trait Sub extends Super { override def foo: Sub }
{code}
