Currently `VectorBuilder` doesn't allow access to the current element count which forces one to keep external counters in all cases where this information is important.

The proposal is to add these three methods to the `VectorBuilder` class:

```scala
    def size: Int = blockIndex + lo
    def isEmpty: Boolean = size == 0
    def nonEmpty: Boolean = size != 0
```
