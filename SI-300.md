The following code:
{code}
  val args = new scala.collection.jcl.HashMap[String, Array[String]]  
  args.put ("foo", Array ("bar"))
{code}
produced Java array before (with Scala 2.6.1 prerelease), but now it produces a BoxedAnyArray
{code}
  args.get ("foo") .get .getClass
{code}
returns "class scala.runtime.BoxedAnyArray".
This leads to
{code}
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.runtime.BoxedAnyArray
{code}
in the Java application, which expected Java array.

According to the [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/scala/Array.html documentation] Array[String] must be a Java array.
Unfortunately, this can't be done unless you create the Array yourself. The code above is using the 'apply' method defined in object {{scala.Array}}. Here it is:

{code}
  def apply[A <: AnyRef](xs: A*): Array[A] = {
    val array = new Array[A](xs.length)
    var i = 0
    for (x <- xs.elements) { array(i) = x; i += 1 }
    array
  }
{code}

the first line, {{new Array[A]}}, can't possibly know the type {{A}} because of erasure. So the compiler creates a {{BoxedArray}} instead. Primitive types work fine because there are overloaded versions of {{apply}} for each primitive type.

You can achieve what you want by inlining (sort of) the above code so that the concrete type of {{A}} is known:

{code}
val arr = new Array[String](1)
arr(0) = "bar"
args.put(...)
{code}

I verified that the example gives a BoxedAnyArray for 2.6.1 RC1, RC2, and final, as well as for 2.6.0 final. Sean did some experimental changes to arrays in-between. He had to revert them because other things broke. See Ticket SI-160. Most likely, the 
``correct_ behavior was observed when Sean's changes were in place. I am closing this one and make a note in SI-160 that they are related.
