In scala.io.Source for the getLine and getLines methods the end of line delimiter is hard coded to '\n'.  Not all systems use '\n'.  Excel csv export for mac unfortunately uses '\r' for eol, breaking Source.

getLine also apparently chops only the '\n' character, which will leave '\r' when '\r\n' is used for eol.

I suggest a lineDelimiter property on src.
