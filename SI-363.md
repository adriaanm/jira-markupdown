Given the following file:

{code}
object Hello2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) =
    println("Hello " + args(0) + "!")
}

class Hello2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = throw new UnsupportedOperationException
}
{code}

This is the result:
{code}
$$ scala -classpath . Hello2 you
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Hello2.main is not static
{code}

If the class's main() method is renamed, this is the result:
{code}
$$ scala -classpath . Hello2 you
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Hello2.main([Ljava.lang.String;)}}
{code}

It appears that the launcher always loads the class with the matching name, if one exists, and if that succeeds, no matter what methods that class has, it never attempts to load the object.  Considering it's not possible to run a non-static main() method, the launcher should always load the object from the launcher.  
This has nothing to do with the launcher scripts. Scala entry points are identical to Java ones, and should remain so (consider SI-50 for an example of why). The issue is that companion objects are not Java-compatible. Probably there's no fix at this stage other than to make it clear in the documentation that entry points must be in standalone objects.
It has, at least if you consider [http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ObjectRunner.scala ObjectRunner] to be a script :). It could be modified to run the main object of the given singleton object. Jamie, why do you think that's a bad idea? (I don't see how issue SI-50 is related).
From the discussion between Martin, Iulian ant Stephane: given a companion object, we generate static forwarders for all methods that do not coincide with an instance method (including the main method).

I've been trying this periodically since it was reported fixed with no luck.  If there's some subtle requirement for making this work it's eluding me.  Here's as simple a test case as I can imagine compiled the 07/30/08 trunk - it doesn't run with or without a main method in the class.  Comment out the empty class and it runs as expected.

{code}
leaf:tmp paulp$$ cat Hello2.scala 
object Hello2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) =
    println("Hello " + args(0) + "!")
}

class Hello2 { }
leaf:tmp paulp$$ scalac Hello2.scala 
leaf:tmp paulp$$ scala Hello2
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Hello2.main([Ljava.lang.String;)
leaf:tmp paulp$$ scala -version

What was the problem with the fix that was reverted? If noone else has time I'll take a look at it, and it'd help if I knew what went wrong with the last attempt.

I am not sure if I feel strongly, but see ticket SI-1735.
It's the ticket that will not die! Reopened as I disabled all forwarders because of SI-1795, which occurs even if I try to generate only a single one for main.
I added a comment to SI-1735 about how without forwarders, JUnit 4's parameterized test feature is not usable from pure Scala.
I believe SI-363 is truly slain in r18434.  Should it rise once again I will seek the black sword Dyrnwyn.
