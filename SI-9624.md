I ran into a problem described in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/oxbowlakes/84e120026ded7f7834b8) whereby a manually-implemented `TraversableOnce` saw incorrect behaviour of the `reduceLeft` method because the `reduceLeft` implementation assumes that calls to `TraversableOnce.isEmpty` are idempotent (i.e. they do not *consume* the traversable). 

This is, of course, how one would expect the method to be implemented on `Iterator` but I believe that the current documentation of the methods falls well short:

```
  /** Self-documenting abstract methods. */
  def foreach[U](f: A => U): Unit
  def isEmpty: Boolean
  def hasDefiniteSize: Boolean
```

I believe that the documentation should *explicitly say* that implementations of `isEmpty` should be **idempotent**.

Furthermore, I believe that `hasDefiniteSize` is absolutely not self-documenting (without understanding where it is called). For example, what does one expect the following to print?

```
scala> Stream.continually(1).iterator.hasDefiniteSize //prints 'false' of course

scala> List(1).iterator.hasDefiniteSize //what does this print?
```

A quick survey of colleagues resulted in everyone assuming that the latter should return `true` (it  doesn't).

Note also that the behaviour of `Traversable` and `Iterator` in this case:

```
scala> val it = List(1).iterator; it foreach (_ => println(it.isEmpty)) //prints 'true'

scala> val it = Traversable(1); it foreach (_ => println(it.isEmpty)) //prints 'false'
```
Right, I think that part simply works as expected. The difference is not due to isEmpty consuming an element. When you get to the first println, the only element of the Iterator has already been consumed (it's passed to your lambda after all), so the Iterator is empty at that point.

Similarly, the first part of this ticket (in the gist) also does the "right" thing but maybe that's because I didn't understand the reason for using a Traversable instead of a TraversableOnce there in the first place. If you implement a Traversable even though your source can only be traversed once and you do not cache the data, it will go wrong at some point. I would implement an Iterator in these cases but that's already the first recommendation in the scaladoc for TraversableOnce:

```scala
 *  Directly subclassing `TraversableOnce` is not recommended - instead,
 *  consider declaring an `Iterator` with a `next` and `hasNext` method,
 *  creating an `Iterator` with one of the methods on the `Iterator` object,
 *  or declaring a subclass of `Traversable`.
```

On second thought, maybe this comment should be changed to warn that the alternative of subclassing Traversable only applies if you really have a source that can be traversed repeatedly (even if all you need is the TraversableOnce part of it).
