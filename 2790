This might be a separate issue, but changing a type alias that is used in a method signature does not cause clients of that method to be recompiled.  This is in r20598.

Given A.scala, B.scala:

{code}
trait A {
    type T = Int
    def x: T
}
object B {
  def x(a: A): Int = a.x
}
{code}

 1. Compile
 1. Change A.scala to:
{code}
trait A {
    type T = Long
    def x: T
}
{code}
 1. Mark A.scala modified, build manager misses error by not recompiling B.scala.
 1. Recompiling B.scala gives:
{code}
B.scala:2: error: type mismatch;
 found   : a.T
 required: Int
  def x(a: A): Int = a.x
                       ^
{code}
