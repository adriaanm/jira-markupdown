Adriaan: assigning to you to contemplate the fix and fix version.

AFAICT, the only fix we could deliver in 2.10.1 would be an improved type inference, which of course is also not without risk (one man's treasure is another man's trash.)

While I'm happy to live with `rand.shuffle((0 until 5).toList)` for the reported bug, I'm worried that the inclusion of `AbstractXxx` will lead to a trickle of these problems being reported.
