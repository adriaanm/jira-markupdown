Class `scala.math.BigInt` defines a method `~` for bitwise complement.  This method should instead be declared `unary_~` for consistency with `Int`, `Long`, etc. which use prefix `~` to denote complement.
(extempore in [r25122](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25122)) Deprecated BigInt#~ in favor of unary_~.  Closes #4659, no review.
