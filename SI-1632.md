I have a large Java/Scala project. Unfortunately, compilation fails because scalac causes a StackOverflowError. 

I have attached the source code of the project. I tried to localize the error but failed. All that I could figure out was that the problem has something to do with file src/scala/javagi/compiler/Translation.scala.

Build instructions (on Unix):

 - Unpack the archive and step into the newly created directory
 - Edit build.sh and adjust the value of scala.home
 - Run build.sh

This should cause output similar to what I have attached to this bug report.

I cannot reproduce your problem (OS X 10.5.6, javac 1.6.0_07, scalac 2.7.2.final).

I'm also unsing javac 1.6.0_07 and scalac 2.7.2.final. My OS is Linux with kernel 2.6.18-6-686 SI-1 SMP.

The problem went away once I set the Java stack size to 1024k. My guess is that the default stack size on Linux is too small. Unfortunately, I could not figure out what the default stack size is.
