This is the kind of report where it's easy to say "no way" and indeed:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> 1+2
res0: Int = 3
{code}
I can hazard a guess.  Somewhere in the windows maze, some piece of software is helpfully trying to give you a "better looking one" (like "smart quotes") and changing it from an old fashioned ascii 1 to some fancy unicode one.  Though I can't even guess how it is turned back into an Int.

No way to do anything with this without more info to pin the blame.
