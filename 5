`SpecialException` is a trait that, after erasure, does not extend Throwable anymore. That's why the type of e1 is `Throwable` and not `SpecialException` (types given in catch blocks have to be subtypes of `Throwable` to pass verification). I think the whole pattern match should be translated to ifs before reaching the backend.
