I'd prefer leading leading {{implicit}} to mean implicit param section.

For {{def f(implicit x: X)}} to mean locally implicit, just 
{code}
def f(x: X) { implicit val xx = x }
{code}

Somewhere, in the distant past, retronym said this was too finicky, but maybe the discussion is worth taking up again.
