If you have an abstract java class like: A.java
{code}
public abstract class A {
  abstract String foo();
  public void run() {
   System.out.println(foo());
  }
}
{code}

And try to extend it with a scala class like:
{code}
class B extends A { override def foo = "B" }
{code}

All is fine until you try to execute the run method:

{code}
scala> (new B).run

It all works fine for me as given.

Duplicate of SI-3663.
it's related to SI-3663, but not a dup (at least not in the sense that my pending fix for SI-3663 also caught this one, unfortunately)
(In r22763) closes SI-3757. stricter override checking: can only override member that you can access

(I verified the added access check does not increase time for ant test-opt)

(In r22764) Revert "closes SI-3757. stricter override checking: can only override member that you can access"

Martin's review indicated this needs a better solution.

This reverts commit 6a62875b08f8a2c80aefee313f86429b2793ee2e.
to illustrate that there's no overriding relation here:

{code}
// A.java
package a;

public class A { void a() {System.out.println("a");} }

// B.java
package b;

public class B extends a.A { void a() {System.out.println("b");} }

// Test.java
package a;

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    a.A a = new b.B();
    a.a();
  }
}
{code}

$$ java a.Test

{code}
a
{code}

yep...
{code}
// A.java
package a;

public abstract class A {
  abstract String foo();
  public void run() {
   System.out.println(foo());
  }
}

// B.java
package b;

public class B extends a.A {
  public String foo() {return "b";}
}
{code}

$$ javac *.java

{code}
B.java:4: b.B is not abstract and does not override abstract method foo() in a.A
public class B extends a.A {
       ^
1 error
{code}

there's no way to implement method foo() in a.A outside of package a (I think)
this compiles and outputs "b"

{code}
package a {
  abstract class A { 
    protected[a] def foo(): String
    def run(): Unit = println(foo())
  }
}

package b {
  class B extends a.A { 
    def foo() = "b"
  }
}

object Test extends Application {
  (new b.B()).run()
}
{code}
from the [http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/names.htmlSI-6.6.5 JLS]:

  6.6.5 Example: Default-Access Fields, Methods, and Constructors

  If none of the access modifiers public, protected, or private are specified, a class member or constructor is accessible throughout the package that contains the declaration of the class in which the class member is declared, but the class member or constructor is not accessible in any other package.

  If a public class has a method or constructor with default access, then this method or constructor is not accessible to or inherited by a subclass declared outside this package.

Replying to [comment:15 moors]:
>   If a public class has a method or constructor with default access, then this method or constructor is not accessible to or inherited by a subclass declared outside this package.

This is a pretty good mess we have going.  I wanted to throw in a reference to SI-2568 here: the behavior, the fact that martin says it's theoretically wrong, and the fact that it's presently wontfix.  And also make an observation which has been weighing on me for a while: protected[pkg] is to some extent broken by design, because it creates in subclasses an access boundary which they cannot even reference.  For instance:

{code}
object B {
  class A {
    protected[B] def foo() = 5
  }
}

class C extends B.A {
  override def foo() = 10
}
{code}
There is no way to perform the override in C without making the method completely public.  You want to be able to say "override and leave the access as it is" but the syntax doesn't exist: protected[B] is disallowed since B does not enclose.

If I have a point in the context of this ticket it is: there are a barrel of corner cases on the usage of scoped access modifiers, but if we're going to make one thing work properly it should be private[pkg] and it should have exactly the same semantics as java's invisible package-private modifier.  This has the big payoff in usefulness, in what people would reasonably expect to work, and most importantly in interoperability.  Of course it also assumes we deal with java package-private correctly.
