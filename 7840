It's strange. When running `NestRunner` all by itself CPU usage stays all the time close to 100% , unlike when running `ant test.suite`.

A few data points (8-core machine, no warm-up, no averaging over multiple runs, relative times are what counts):
- Baseline: running `partest --run` results in
```
All of 986 tests were successful (elapsed time: 00:13:13)
```
with 4 GB peak memory use.
- running `scala.tools.partest.nest.NestRunner --run` with 
```
-Dactors.corePoolSize=32 -Dpartest.actors=32 -Dactors.maxPoolSize=64 -Dactors.enableForkJoin=true
```
results in
```
All of 986 tests were successful (elapsed time: 00:15:56)
```
with 5 GB peak memory use.
- running `NestRunner --run` with only `-Dactors.enableForkJoin=false` results in
```
All of 986 tests were successful (elapsed time: 00:13:09)
```
with 6 GB peak memory use. Regarding pool size, `--debug` informs us that:
```
Info: actors.corePoolSize not defined

Testing interpreter and backend
Info: initializing scala.actors.Scheduler$@351563ff...
Info: Thread[Thread-1,5,main]: corePoolSize = 12, maxPoolSize = 256
Info: scala.actors.Scheduler$@351563ff: starting new Thread[Thread-1,5,main] 
      [class scala.actors.scheduler.ResizableThreadPoolScheduler]
```

Background info, quoting from `scala.actors.Actor`
```
 *  If actors use blocking operations (for example, methods for blocking I/O),
 *  there are several options:
 *
 *  - The run-time system can be configured to use a larger thread pool size
 *    (for example, by setting the `actors.corePoolSize` JVM property).
 *  - The `scheduler` method of the `Actor` trait can be overridden to return a
 *    `ResizableThreadPoolScheduler`, which resizes its thread pool to
 *    avoid starvation caused by actors that invoke arbitrary blocking methods.
 *  - The `actors.enableForkJoin` JVM property can be set to `false`, in which
 *    case a `ResizableThreadPoolScheduler` is used by default to execute actors.
```

Summing up:

|| `NestRunner --run` ||elapsed time||
| ForkJoinScheduler, parallelism == 12 | 13 minutes |
| ForkJoinScheduler, parallelism == 32 | 16 minutes |
| ResizableThreadPoolScheduler         | 13 minutes |
