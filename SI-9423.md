there is an error in this API doc: 
http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Iterator 

quote: "Iterators are data structures that allow to iterate over a sequence of elements. They have a hasNext method for checking if there is a next element available, +and a next method which returns the next element and discards it from the iterator+".

The 'next' method does not discard the element from the iterator but above sentence says so.
