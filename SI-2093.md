I have a trait Logged which declares a method infof thus: 

{code}
  protected def infof(msg: String, os: Any*) = if (log.isLoggable(Level.INFO)) {
    log.log(Level.INFO, msg.format(os : _ *))
  }
{code}
I have test class which is declared as follows (*in a different package*): 

{code}
class LoggedTest extends Logged { //this is line 13

  def someMethod(): Unit = {
    infof("Here is a tuple %s and a boolean %s", (1, "Hello"), false) //works
    for (tu <- TimeUnit.values) {
        infof("Here is a tuple %s and a boolean %s", (tu.name, "Hello"), true) //this is line 17 - throws Exception
    }
  }
}
{code}

Basically this is throwing a runtime MissingFormatArgument exception at line 17, which is odd because this call to infof looks exactly like the previous one on line 15, which proceeded just fine. 

1. *Everything works if I declare LoggedTest in the same package as Logged*
2. *Everything works fine if I declare infof to be a public method*

The reason for the failure is the bold lines in the below stack trace: the call to infof seems to be duplicated and my infof method is ultimately being called with an Array with one element (that element is itself an Array with 2 elements). If I declare my tests in the same package as Logged then I don't see the "protected$$infof" duplicate call in the stack.

	at myutil.Logged$$class.infof(Logged.scala:86)
	at mytest.LoggedTest.infof(LoggedTest.scala:13)
	at mytest.LoggedTest.protected$$infof(LoggedTest.scala:17)
	at mytest.LoggedTest$$$$anonfun$$someMethod$$1.apply(LoggedTest.scala:17)
	at mytest.LoggedTest$$$$anonfun$$someMethod$$1.apply(LoggedTest.scala:16)
	at scala.Iterator$$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:414)

I would expect that this method call would proceed as per the call on the previous line
