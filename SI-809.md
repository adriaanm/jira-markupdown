I think it would help immensely if the Scaladoc for Int linked to RichInt and stated
that there is an implicit conversion from Int to RichInt (Ditto for the other Type/RichType pairs)
Fixed in r14867 (except for the case of String/RichString, but there is not
much that can be done about changing the documentation for String).
