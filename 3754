Here is why it happens.  This case statement, slightly snipped, lets EmptyHashMap fall through to the default.
{code}
        elems(i) match {
          case m: HashTrieMap[A,B] => // push current pos onto stack and descend
          case m: HashMap1[A,B] => m.ensurePair
          case m =>
            subIter = m.iterator
            subIter.next
        }
{code}
I don't know the implementation well enough to confidently fix it right now, but I think tiark can fix it pretty easily.
