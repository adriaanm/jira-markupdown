Given that scala has powerful imports, plus we can rename/alias types, it would be great if we could just use the same name/expression for types in scaladoc comments as we use in the code - rather than having to use fully qualified names in link.

e.g.

{code}
/** something [[List]] */
{code}

rather than


{code}
/** something [[scala.collection.immutable.List]] */
{code}

We will have a complete scaladoc tutorial on [http://docs.scala-lang.org] shortly. Until then, citing the scaladoc tool:

Quick crash course on using Scaladoc links
==========================================
 - Links relative to the current template should work. Make sure to use fully qualified names 
if the member is inherited into other templates or is inherited by implicit conversions (as 
they will be expanded relative to the containing template)
Disambiguating terms and types: Prefix terms with '$' and types with '!' in case both names are in use:
 - [[scala.collection.immutable.List!.apply class List's apply method]] and
 - [[scala.collection.immutable.List$.apply object List's apply method]]
Disambiguating overloaded members: If a term is overloaded, you can indicate the first part of its signature followed by *:
 - [[[scala.collection.immutable.List$.fill[A](Int)(?A):List[A]* Fill with a single parameter]]]
 - [[[scala.collection.immutable.List$.fill[A](Int,Int)(?A):List[List[A]]* Fill with a two parameters]]]
Notes: 
 - you can use any number of matching square brackets to avoid interference with the signature
 - you can use \. to escape dots in prefixes (don't forget to use * at the end to match the signature!)
 - you can use \# to escape hashes, otherwise they will be considered as delimiters, like dots.

Another crash course on links: [http://www.slideshare.net/VladUreche/scaladoc-reflection/17]

As of scala 2.10.3 the following doesn't work for me:
{code}
package a

class A {
  def nice() {}
  def nice(s: String) {
  }
}

class B {
  /**
   * A link to [[A.nice(String)]]
   * @see [[A.nice(String)]]
   */
  def ooh() {

  }
}
{code}

I get 

{code}
methodlink.scala:10: warning: Could not find any member to link for "A.nice(String)".
  /**
  ^
one warning found
{code}

Are method links a work in progress? Should I fill a bug report?

About the documentation..
How can you get the "Quick crash course" from the scaladoc tool? I couldn't find any command line option to trigger it.
It would also be nice to have a direct link to the documentation, but it seems it has not been written yet? 

Thanks
Using {code}A.nice(s: String){code} here is what I get:

{code}
methodlink.scala:10: warning: Could not find any member to link for "A.nice(s:".
  /**
  ^
one warning found
{code}
Done - SI-8067.  Thanks!
None of the three work:

{code}
method-link.scala:10: warning: Could not find any member to link for "A.nice(String)".
  /**
  ^
method-link.scala:18: warning: Could not find any member to link for "A.nice(s:".
  /**
  ^
method-link.scala:26: warning: Could not find any member to link for "A.nice(s:String)".
  /**
  ^
three warnings found
{code}
Yep: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8734

Thanks!
