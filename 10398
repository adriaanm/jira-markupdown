I haven't submitted this PR yet, but what do you think of:

https://github.com/som-snytt/scala/blob/a2e243369c18a5c1991dfff59644d710fa6395b5/src/library/scala/util/matching/Regex.scala#L467

`"a*b".r.quoted` with the additional use case `r"a*b".quoted` for the regex interpolator.

Open question how to compose quoted parts; I haven't looked at it, but it must be nicely done somewhere.  E.g., {code}(a\*b)*{code} is {code}s"(${Pattern quote "a*b"})*".r{code}, is there a nicer way.
