```scala
class A {
  def foo(x: String) = 1
}

class B {
  def foo(x: String) = 1
}

class C {
  def foo(x: Int) = 2
}

object Test extends Application {
  implicit def a2b(x: A): B = new B
  implicit def a2c(x: A): C = new C
  val a = new A
  Predef print a.foo(1)
}
```
Now it compiles. According to spec, it shouldn't (7.3 Views):

2. In a selection e.m with e of type T , if the selectorm does not denote a member
of T . In this case, a view v is searched which is applicable to e andwhose result
contains a member named m. The search proceeds as in the case of implicit
parameters, where the implicit scope is the one of T . If such a view is found,
the selection e.m is converted to v(e).m.

So in this section something should be changed.
