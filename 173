On further investigation I see that :: is done this way to support {{ListBuffer}}.  I have to say I think this is unwise. :: should be truly immutable!

I also see that :: has custom readObject(...) and writeObject(...) methods.  I think this is unnecessary - It should be sufficient for Nil to have a readResolve() method that ensures that the correct singleton instance is returned.  In fact that should be the default behaviour for all 'objects' - perhaps it is already?
