This has nothing to do with the launcher scripts. Scala entry points are identical to Java ones, and should remain so (consider scala/bug#50 for an example of why). The issue is that companion objects are not Java-compatible. Probably there's no fix at this stage other than to make it clear in the documentation that entry points must be in standalone objects.
