(In r24266) This addresses a few long standing irritations with jline,
rewriting chunks of it along the way.  No longer does columnar
output spill over and double space everything if you're unlucky
with the chosen widths.  Pagination works for a higher
definition of work.  Etc.

Also, for those who enjoy operating missile systems from their
repls, crash recovery now requests your permission before replaying
the session.

Closes scala/bug#4194, no review.
