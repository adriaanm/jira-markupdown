Currently (Scala 2.8.1) lazy vals will be guarded by public bitmap$$n fields. This makes it impossible to use Scala in Java EE 6 / CDI. protected access would be sufficient to make Scala a good CDI citizen.
this is pretty complicated to do:
   * need accessors for access from nested classes (since they are later flattened), ... and all other accesses that don't meet JVM requirement
   * for self-types it's unclear where to put the accessor
