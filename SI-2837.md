It seems grouped and sliding are the only two methods exclusive to Iterator which are not somehow specific to it.

I ask that they be added to traits of the proper collections.
(In r20544) Made Iterator consistent with Iterable by adding grouped and
sliding to IterableLike.  Closes #2837.  Review by community.
