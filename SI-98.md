```scala
assertEquals({ println("computing expected"); 1 }, { println("computing actual"); 2 })
```

prints:

```scala
computing expected
computing actual
computing actual
bebe failed due to failed assertion:(no message), expected: 1, actual: 2
```

Seems like parameters to assertEquals should be passed by value, not by name.
This one's easy to fix:

```scala
def assertEquals[A](msg: String, expected: A, actual: => A) {
  val a = actual; if (expected != a) fail(msg, expected, a)
}
```

(Or maybe with lazy parameters if they were supported) Is there a reason why expected is not call by name too? It seems that all other asserts (except assertEquals) are call by name on both, expected and actual. And why call by name at all?
fixed in r13345, by making all arguments cbv. The original idea was **probably** to do something fancy with output redirection ... but nobody seems to need such a thing anyway.
