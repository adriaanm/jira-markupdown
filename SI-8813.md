This seems to work in Scala 2.10.4 but no more in Scala 2.11.x.

scala> class annot extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

scala> trait A { @annot val x: Int }
<console>:8: warning: no valid targets for annotation on value x - it is discarded unused. You may specify targets with meta-annotations, e.g. @(annot @getter)
       trait A { @annot val x: Int }
                  ^
defined trait A

I've just realized this warning was intended for reflection about annotation, which is precisely what I wanted to do. See SI-6325.
The warning should not be issued for annotations that are elided by the compiler anyway, e.g. @BeanProperty:

{code}
scala> trait A {@BeanProperty var x: Int }
<console>:8: warning: no valid targets for annotation on method x - it is discarded unused. You may specify targets with meta-annotations, e.g. @(scala.beans.BeanProperty @getter)
       trait A {@BeanProperty var x: Int }
{code}
I am trying to upgrade our project to scala 2.11 and add a cross build and see this same compiler error with Scala 2.11.0 through 5 with:  (for sc and rtf @transient)

{code}
class CassandraRDD[R] private[connector] (
    @transient sc: SparkContext,
    val connector: CassandraConnector,
    val keyspaceName: String,
    val tableName: String,
    val columnNames: ColumnSelector = AllColumns,
    val where: CqlWhereClause = CqlWhereClause.empty,
    val readConf: ReadConf = ReadConf())(
  implicit
    ct : ClassTag[R], @transient rtf: RowReaderFactory[R])
  extends RDD[R](sc, Seq.empty) with Logging{code}

Same compiler error if I use these against 2.11.0 - 5:
@(transient @scala.annotation.meta.field)
@(transient @scala.annotation.meta.getter)
