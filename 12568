This is a known issue: Scala-defined annotations are never emitted as Java-style annotations in the classfile, and therefore not visible to Java reflection. If you need an annotation to be visible to Java reflection, it needs to be defined in Java.

What you're looking for would be {{ClassfileAnnotation}}, not {{StaticAnnotation}}, but it's not implemented, you'll get a compile-time warning.
