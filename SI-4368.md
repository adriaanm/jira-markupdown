=== What is the expected behavior? ===

asInstanceOf and isInstanceOf 

that's what people write and read in the code

=== What do you see instead? ===

$$asInstanceOf and $$isInstanceOf

=== Additional information ===

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: Scala code runner version 2.8.1.final -- Copyright 2002-2010, LAMP/EPFL
  - Java: java version "1.6.0_18"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.7) (fedora-50.1.8.7.fc13-i386)
OpenJDK Server VM (build 14.0-b16, mixed mode)

  - Operating system: Linux localhost.localdomain 2.6.34.8-68.fc13.i686.PAE SI-1 SMP Thu Feb 17 14:54:10 UTC 2011 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
However we can see asInstanceOf and isInstanceOf on the document, and $$asInstanceOf and $$isInstanceOf is defined actually.

```scala
% ./build/pack/bin/scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0.r24552-b20110326101252 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_24).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> "hello".$$isInstanceOf[String]
res0: Boolean = true

scala> 

```

Should we hide $$asInstanceOf and $$isInstanceOf?
(In r24696) Set "synthetic" flag for methods $$asInstanceOf and $$isInstanceOf. Closes #4368. No review.
