It looks like even when there's no @ binding, the pattern matcher is helpfully noticing that the value on the rhs is the same as the one on the lhs.  No CCE since scala/bug#1503, but not exactly a model of unbrokenness either.
```scala
scala> case object Bob { override def equals(other: Any) = true }
defined module Bob

scala> def f(x: Any) = x match { case Bob => Bob }
f: (x: Any)object Bob

scala> f(5)
res0: object Bob = null
```
