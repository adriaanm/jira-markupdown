On line 267 in `MarkupParser.scala`, the method `xToken` always throws an exception if the input character wasn't expected. This makes it difficult to use `MarkupParser` to parse XML documents that might be corrupt.
As discussed on scala-xml... Wontfix, but SI-1436 (feeding in an alternative SAX parser) seems like it should be a more orthogonal way to achieve this goal (i.e. the SAX parser you supply can feel free to attempt to recover from bad syntax, and only fire events for the good parts of the document)
