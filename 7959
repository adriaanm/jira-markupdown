I believe that the error is accurate. I've improved the error message a little:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/850

It will now issue:

{code}
 t6042.scala:7: error: illegal type selection from volatile type a.OpSemExp (with upper bound LazyExp[a.OpSemExp] with _$1)
{code}

The {{with _$1}} part is the reason we can't project the type {{Val}}. It corresponds to {{with This}} in type alias definition, substituted with a existential skolem.
