> I think we should simply disallow private vals in case class's primary constructor.

Been there, did that, purchased the t-shirts, discovered this,
```scala
final case class ::[B](private var hd: B, private[scala] var tl: List[B]) extends List[B]
```
returned to drawing board.

Unless you mean "disallow private vals but not private vars", but it seems unlikely you mean that since it would be inexplicable and also wouldn't remove any problem we have.
