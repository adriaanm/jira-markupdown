Running this:

```scala
object NestedCasesExceptions extends Application {	
	"something" match {
		case "someother" => {
			try {
				println("matched someother")
			}catch{
				case x => throw new Exception("Aww, crap")
			}
		}
		case "something" => {
			try {
				println("Matched something")
			}catch {
				case y => throw new Exception("Other")
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Produces this output:

```scala
Matched something

Unhandled Exception: System.TypeInitializationException: An exception was thrown by the type initializer for NestedCasesExceptions$$ ---> scala.MatchError: something
  at NestedCasesExceptions$$..ctor () [0x00000] 
  at NestedCasesExceptions$$..cctor () [0x00000] --- End of inner exception stack trace ---

  at <Module>.Main (System.String[] args) [0x00000] 
```

...when I would have expected only the first line of output and not the subsequent MatchError.

It seems to specifically be a problem when nesting match/case statements and exception handlers. Running on:
