Per our discussion: https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/pull/229#issuecomment-42244072
```

# I'm assuming you have a breeze checkout. If not:
git clone https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze

# Add me as a remote
git remote add dlwh  https://github.com/dlwh/breeze

git fetch

# First, the fully working version.
# Resolves problem by annotating return types explicitly
# Only the canMapValues and canMapCols implicits needed to be fixed.
git checkout 76e36b824d5f18fe6d0fe37004262e9ba148eee8

# works. 
sbt clean compile 

# Also works, does what should be an unnecessary conversion to a better behaved type
git checkout dlwh/separate-compile-good

# should work
sbt clean compile 

# this commit was the problematic one
git checkout dlwh/separate-compile-bad

# also works, assuming you compile dlwh/separate-compile-good first
sbt compile

# doesn't work
sbt clean compile
```
