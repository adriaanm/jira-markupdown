I often use a definite Stream containing n-times the same element. The Array object provides this functionality via {{make[A] (n : Int, elem : A) : Array[A]}}, however Stream lacks of an equivalent. Applying the attached patch should enhance the Stream object accordingly.
Martin proposed to add {{Stream.const[a](elem: a)}} which creates an infinite stream given a constant value. Then {{make}} is just a {{take}} on this stream.
