Further experiment seems to indicate that it has something to do not with the override-modifier but with the lack of parameter list parentheses. Add some and it works again

Demo:
```scala
class FormattingBug {
def a:Int = {
1
}

def b() :Int = {
1	
}

}
```

Try Mark All then Indent and look at the result, after this try:
```scala
class FormattingBug {
def a():Int = {
1
}

def b() :Int = {
1	
}

}
```

Again, Mark All --> Indent
