From a discussion on Scala User:

I think the spec should be updated to replace:

"If there is precisely one alternative in A which is a (possibly
polymorphic) method
type whose arity matches the number of arguments given, that
alternative is chosen."

with:

"If there is precisely one alternative in `A` which is a (possibly
polymorphic) method
type which is potentially applicably to the arguments given, that
alternative is chosen.

A list of arguments `(e1, ..., em)` is potentially applicable to a
method `m` in the context of an expected type E if the arguments `(e1', ..., em')` are applicable to `m`, either with the expected type `E` or with
no expected type. `ei'` is defined as the shape of the argument `ei`.

The shape of an argument is defined as:

 * for a function expression of `(p1: T1, ..., pn: TN) => body`: `(p1$$: Any,..., pn$$: Any) => shape(body)`
 * for a named argument `name = expr`: name = `shape(expr))`
 * for all other expressions: `nothing$$`, where `nothing$$` an synthetic expression of type `Nothing`.
