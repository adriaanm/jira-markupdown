Executing a JUnit 3 style test case (i.e. extending from class TestCase) results in "No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 3'" depending on how TestCase is imported:
```scala
//import junit.framework.TestCase  // This works
import junit.framework.{TestCase}  // this doesn't: No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 3'
```
