When using *scala* to run a script, if there are any compilation errors, it should exit with a non-zero exit value. (Currently, it exits with 0 in all cases)

This is a convention strictly adhered by most interpreters/shells and makes it easy to chain commands, for example,
{code}
scala myScript || echo "myScript was unsuccessful"
{code}
Note that *scalac* does return a non-zero exit status on errors. I wanted to report this bug specifically for *scala* in script mode.
