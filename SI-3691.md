I haven't found this reported in an existing ticket. Searching for 'tcpoly kind' does find some that are in the same ballpark: SI-2070 SI-2086

See also this thread on scala-user: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/29075

scalac currently disallows kind-mismatches between an member and an overriding member, although I can't find this in the spec. I suggest to update the definition of _subsumes_ to require the kinds match, which would apply to both compound type conformance and overriding.
(In r22762) closes SI-3691. moved kind conformance checks to types because it needs to be checked as part of specializesSym.

TODO: clean this up, introduce datatypes to denote kinds, split checkKindBounds into kind inference and subkind checking
