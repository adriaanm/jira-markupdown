Methods as intercept and diff for Collections and String Objects not returning correct value.
For simulate the problem execute that test:
```scala
/**
 * Issue in methods diff and intercept for classes String and Collections
 * 
 * For tests execute that sample with:
 * 
 * In with diff: ("SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" diff "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS") length
 * Out Should to be: 5  BUT RESPONSE HERE IS 3.
 * 
 * In with intersect: "SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" intersect "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS" 
 * Out Should to be: "SOSSSSSSSS" BUT RESPONSE HERE IS "SOSSOSSSSSSS" 
 *

object MarsExploration {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val sc = io.Source.stdin.getLines
    val S = sc.next();
    val s = "SOS"*(S.length/3)
    println((s diff S) length)
    println(s intersect S)
  }
}
```
Let's take "intersect" for example. The Scaladoc for "intersect" says:

- If an element value `x` appears ''n'' times in `that`, then the first ''n'' occurrences of `x` will be retained in the result, but any following occurrences will be omitted.

Consider `"SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" intersect "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS"` and the letter O. O occurs at least twice on the right, so both O's on the left should be retained. You're telling me the answer ought to be "SOSSSSSSSS", but that only has one O in it.
it appears to me from a quick glance at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/set_intersection/ that the STL's `set_intersection` method implements set intersection on sorted ranges. Scala's intersection method, on the other hand, implements multiset intersection and doesn't require sorted input. So you shouldn't expect the same answer.
```
~ % ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> import Data.List
Prelude Data.List> intersect "SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS"
"SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO"
```

I think our methods are working as designed and documented. If you think they ought to be designed differently, I'd suggest that you start a mailing list thread about it and see if there is consensus. (But personally I think you'd have an uphill battle there.)
I'm guessing, but perhaps this will be helpful for your use case?

```
scala> ("SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" zip "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS").count{case (a, b) => a != b}
res12: Int = 5
```
