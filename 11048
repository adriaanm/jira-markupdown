Thanks for the "export compile" trick.  It gave the attached file output which I don't expect to be very useful.  Bisecting with it is a bit like whack-a-mole with deleting the code just makes the problem move to another area.  The file listed in the compiler had no "->" operators in it.

Your conjecture that SI-6723 may be the root cause is plausible since exceeding inline counts could explain why a "global compile" fails when an "incremental compile" succeeds.

FYI, I tried using sbt 13.6 but that didn't put any line numbers into the warning output, not surprisingly.
