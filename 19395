The following code fails with `value foo$1 is not a member of foo.State`:
```scala
package foo

object State
case class State(private val foo: Int)
```

Note that the companion object is necessary to fail. A presentation compiler test is available [here](https://github.com/dragos/scala/commit/218ca71f095658400a1260c29d4a845abee81b2d)
