The following code does not behave as expected:
```scala
val input = scala.io.Source.stdin.getLines.toStream
input.sliding(2).foreach(println)
```

It should start printing out values as soon as the user has supplied 2 values, but it only starts after the third. To generalize, it only starts after n + 1, so for instance, if using `sliding(1)`, it will only start printing out values after the second element, when it should be printing the first one right away.
I just noticed that the following somewhat further reduced example produces the same unexpected behaviour:

```scala
val input = scala.io.Source.stdin.getLines
input.sliding(2).foreach(println)
```

Which leads me to think it's not something related to Streams so I should probably update the title.
