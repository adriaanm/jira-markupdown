The following code compiles with 2.10.3 but fails with 2.11.0-M8:
```scala
  val skinnable = new javafx.scene.control.Skinnable {
    def skinProperty = null
    def getSkin = null
    def setSkin(s: javafx.scene.control.Skin[_]) {}
  }
```
fails with error message:
```
[error] ...: object creation impossible, since method setSkin in trait Skinnable of type (x$1: javafx.scene.control.Skin
[_])Unit is not defined
[error] (Note that javafx.scene.control.Skin[_] does not match javafx.scene.control.Skin[_ <: javafx.scene.control.Skinnable]: their type parameters differ)
[error]   val skinnable = new javafx.scene.control.Skinnable {
[error]                       ^
```

In Java "setSkin" is defines as:
```java
void setSkin(Skin<?> value)
```
see http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/control/Skinnable.html

This is a critical bug since there is no workaround, that I can see.

A sample SBT project is attached (you need to define variable JAVA_HOME pointing to Java 1.7 SDK installation).
I confirmed my fix for #6169 fixes this one. Closing as duplicate -- thanks for the small reproduction!
