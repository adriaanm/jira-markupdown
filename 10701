```

I believe that the error message itself might be misleading; that error is issued after determining that Object doesn't contain the field.
```scala
        def checkField(obj: TypeKind, field: Symbol): Unit = obj match {
          case REFERENCE(sym) =>
            if (sym.info.member(field.name) == NoSymbol)
              icodeError(" " + field + " is not defined in class " + clasz)
          case _ =>
            icodeError(" expected reference type, but " + obj + " found")
        }
```

Object is the type (unconditionally) attributed to `$inlThis`.
```scala
        // store the '$this' into the special local
        val inlinedThis = newLocal("$inlThis", REFERENCE(ObjectClass))
```
