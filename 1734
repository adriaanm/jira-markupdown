Hum... it looks like just a Windows things. I ran with any command with that argument it resulted the same:

{code}
D:\>blah -e "println(\"a->b\")"
The system cannot find the path specified.
{code}

I can get around my arrow output by doing this lengthy string:
{code}
D:\>scala -e "println(\"a-\" + '>' + \"b\")"
a->b
{code}

If anyone has better solution, please give advice, otherwise I guess this won't consider as Scala script bug, and you may close this ticket.

Thanks.
