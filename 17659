Quoth the spec:

{quote}
(6.23) An expression (of syntactic category {{Expr}}) may contain embedded underscore symbols {{_}} at places where identifiers are legal.
{quote}

Does the identifier used as the root of a path of a type in a constructor not qualify for some reason?

(I know, I'm even rolling my eyes at myself a little for wanting this to work, but a spec is a spec.)
