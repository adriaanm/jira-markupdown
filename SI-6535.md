30 errors is a lot of errors for something which should be a no-op.  It's supposed to mean "extends AnyRef" already!

object As {
  import Bs.B._

  object A
  extends scala.Immutable // needed for the cycle; scala.{Serializable, Clonable} also work.
                          // replacing with a locally defined closs doesn't cycle.
}

object Bs {
  import As.A._

  object B
  extends AnyRef // or scala.Immutable / whatever...
}

I believe the cycle was valid: although adding {{scala.AnyRef}} as a parent is a no-op, determining that "AnyRef" binds to said class requires interrogation of enclosing imports, which is enough to expose the cycle.

I added a neg test case to show the situation, and also rearranged the imports to avoid flying so close to the sun.

Would you agree that it's a bug that it fails even if I fully qualify everything with _root_,
e.g. _root_.scala.AnyRef? We have already established in other tickets that _root_ is barely
acknowledged internally; you can define a package named _root_, etc. But if _root_ were
handled like the reserved word that it should be, then a parent _root_.scala.AnyRef should
not require any enhanced interrogation.
