Pattern matching that involves extractors cannot be typechecked twice. The first typecheck distorts its structure, introducing UnApply node that wraps a synthetic SELECTOR_DUMMY ident that doesn't have a definition. If one performs resetAllAttrs, the resulting tree can no longer be typechecked.
Here's a potential solution: undo the wrapping {{Unapply(Apply(Select(qual, <unapply selector>), args)) }} in {{ResetAttrs}}.

It solves Eugene Y.'s reported problem with extractors in macros, but does not yet fix run/idempotency-extractors.scala (with the toolbox compiler).
