In the definition of `f` I should have at least proved that `R <: (Int, Int)`, if not `R <: (Int, Int) with Unit`, but that is not the case.  With 2.12.0-M1:

{code:title=Nussli.scala}
package nussli

trait Base {
  type R
}

trait A {self:A with B =>
  type R <: (Int, Int)
  def f(r:R) = r._1
}

trait B {
  type R <: Unit
}
```scala

yields
```
…/Nussli.scala:9: value _1 is not a member of A.this.R
  def f(r:R) = r._1
                 ^
{code}

Also affects 2.11.7, 2.10.5, 2.9.3.

Found by Marc-Antoine Nüssli [in this scala-user post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-user/gyIjIeUxYd4/sVi6iM4KWjoJ), which contains a longer example of failing code.
