well, since "make the invocation atomic and make sure that the mapping function is applied only once"
seems to be a critical use case, you would merely annoy users by forcing them to use {{synchronized}}
every time they touch {{getOrElseUpdate}}. then they would flock to this page in anger :-)

probably you could relax the "purity" of {{TrieMap}} and start "using locks under-the-hood"?
