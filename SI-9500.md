Create the following two compilation units in package test:

```scala
// test/package.scala
package object test {
  type Seq[+A] = scala.collection.immutable.Seq[A]
}

// test/Foo.scala
package test

object Foo {
  def foo(s: Seq[Any]) = ()
  
  foo(Seq()) // <-- presentation compiler reports error here
}
```

The error reported by the presentation compiler is `type mismatch; found : Seq[Nothing] required: test.Seq[Any] (which expands to) scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Any]`.

Changing `Seq()` to `scala.collection.immutable.Seq()` fixes the problem. But of course it shouldn't be necessary given the type alias definition in the package object.
