I can't explain it, it was more from an intuition than anything else. Having M invariant in the code from which I extracted the snipped felt a lot better. That, the compiler and you saying it is wrong, I din't look twice.

Now since you ask, I played with the variance of M and Foo and here are the compilation results:
```scala
M    Foo   compiles
-     -      No   
+     -      No
inv   -      Yes
-     +      Yes
+     +      Yes
Inv   +      Yes
```

It is strange that the compiler says Foo.fooIsM is invalid but it compiles when I provide Foo.fooIsM[Bar] explicitly. I'm at a loss to understand this error but if there is an explanation I'd like to hear it.
