You can change the stack size by specifying the -Xss argument (via -vmargs) either on the command line you use to launch Eclipse or in your Eclipse config.ini.

The following are the relevant lines from the config.ini I use when working on the Scala compiler, library and Eclipse plugin in Eclipse 3.4.1 ... I would Imagine that the Fortress project is of a similar size and complexity.
```scala
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
-vmargs
-Xms256m
-Xmx1024m
-XX:PermSize=64m
-Xss1M
```
