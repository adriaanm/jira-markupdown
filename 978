You know, the definition of toArray in Seq is
```scala
  override def toArray[B >: A]: Array[B] = {
    val result = new Array[B](length)
    copyToArray(result, 0)
    result
  }
```

Funny fact about this definition? s/length/size and it works **perfectly** as a generic implementation for toArray in Collection. 

So, in conclusion, this can be fixed in a way that decreases the number of lines of code in the standard library.
