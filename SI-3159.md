While trying to compile scalandra with scala 2.8 I found that the compiler will suck down 40% of main memory and enter a loop from which it never seems to terminate.  Turning on debugging doesn't seem to help either, as it does not appear to show any activity during this loop.

Steps to reproduce:

clone my scalandra fork:

git clone http://github.com/cliffmoon/scalandra.git

and build:

cd scalandra
ant

Debug output is turned on in the compiler.
Please reopen the ticket once you can provide a *small* example that reproduces the problem. Thanks.
