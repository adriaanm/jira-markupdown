As an aside, it's possible to synthesize a type equivalent to `Nothing` which *won't* cause the typer to retract the solution,
```scala
type ReallyNothing = Nothing { type T = Unit }
```

ie. `Nothing` with a dummy refinement. Repl session ...
```scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

trait Stuff[A]
def take[A](st: Stuff[A]): Stuff[A] = st
 
take(??? : Stuff[ReallyNothing])

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.
