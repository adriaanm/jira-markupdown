None of the following examples raise a compiler warning:
```scala
sealed abstract class Base 
case class Derived extends Base 
 
object Test extends Application 
{ 
  def foo(b : Base) = { 
    b match { 
      case d : Derived => 10 
    } 
  } 
} 
```
```scala
sealed case class Base 
case class Derived extends Base 
 
object Test extends Application 
{ 
  def foo(b : Base) = { 
    b match { 
      case d : Derived => 10 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

The difference is that in one Base is a abstract class and in the second it is
concrete.

Even using
```scala
sealed class Base 
class Derived extends Base 
```

doesn't generate any warnings.
