None of the following examples raise a compiler warning:

{code}
sealed abstract class Base 
case class Derived extends Base 
 
object Test extends Application 
{ 
  def foo(b : Base) = { 
    b match { 
      case d : Derived => 10 
    } 
  } 
} 
{code}

{code}
sealed case class Base 
case class Derived extends Base 
 
object Test extends Application 
{ 
  def foo(b : Base) = { 
    b match { 
      case d : Derived => 10 
    } 
  } 
} 
{code}

The difference is that in one Base is a abstract class and in the second it is
concrete.

Even using

{code}
sealed class Base 
class Derived extends Base 
{code}

doesn't generate any warnings.
