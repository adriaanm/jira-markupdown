scalac [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/tools/scalac.html man page] says:

> The default class path is the current directory. Setting the CLASSPATH variable or using the -classpath command-line option overrides that default, so if you want to include the current directory in the search path, you must include "." in the new settings.

However, if I specify classpath explicitly, current directory is in classpath:

{code}
# scalac -classpath /tmp -verbose ../hello.scala
[Classpath = /usr/local/jdk1.6.0_05/jre/lib/resources.jar: ... :.:/tmp]
...
{code}
