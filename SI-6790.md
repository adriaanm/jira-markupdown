(This should really be 2.10.0-RC5, but JIRA would not let me enter that.)

I emailed scala-internals about this issue. Basically, I have a pattern match that under RC3 and earlier did not issue any warnings but which now gives the following:

<code>
[warn] /Users/erik/w/spire/src/main/scala/test.scala:2: Cannot check match for unreachability.

[warn]   def qux(s: String): String = s match {

[warn] one warning found

The suggestion (upping the analysis budget) does work, but I wonder if maybe there is a bug, since the pattern to be checked is relatively simple (a bunch of literal strings terminated by a wildcard). I have attached the test case I used.
Duplicate of #6942, i've confirmed that the open pull request fixes this example.
