I was curious if the immutable.HashSet part of the fix would have any effect on ticket SI-454. While testing it, it seems like SI-454 is the same as this _but_ the immutable.HashSet fix is incorrect. It does:

{code}
s += tableSize 
{code}

instead of

{code}
s += m.tableSize 
{code}

So, once you fix the "fix", feel free to close SI-454 too. :)
