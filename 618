I was curious if the immutable.HashSet part of the fix would have any effect on ticket scala/bug#454. While testing it, it seems like scala/bug#454 is the same as this *but* the immutable.HashSet fix is incorrect. It does:
```scala
s += tableSize 
```

instead of
```scala
s += m.tableSize 
```

So, once you fix the "fix", feel free to close scala/bug#454 too. :)
