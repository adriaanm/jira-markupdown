See [http://www.nabble.com/Converting-a-Java-wildcard-to-a-Scala-existential-td15047532.html#a15047532 this thread] for details.

The upshot is that the compiler seems to produce existential types (for Java methods) that one can't actually write in Scala, but that one would like to write:

Scala sees the Type of the following Java code:
```scala
public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list) {}
```
as:
```scala
sort{[T <: java.lang.Comparable[T_sort1] forSome { T_sort1 >: T }](java.util.List[T])Unit}
```

But we cannot define a method with this type in Scala, even though we would like to. Is this correct? If so, why?
All true. But I don't think I want to complicate existentials further to support this.
