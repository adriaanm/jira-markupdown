The following program results in an ArrayStack with an ArrayStack with two Objects and a null element when it should end up with an ArrayStack with three Objects.

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayStack
var x = ArrayStack[Object](new Object, new Object, new Object)
x filter (_.isInstanceOf[Object])
{code}
Test case in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1733. I'm not sure when it was fixed, it was sometime in {{v2.9.2...v2.10.0-M1}}.
