The companion of `Equiv` defines an implicit that materializes the type class for **any** type, using default equality.

This is harmful, since `Equiv` cannot be safely used as a type class:

```scala
def maybeMerge(x: Foo, y: Foo)(implicit fooEquiv: Equiv[Foo]) =
  if (fooEquiv.equiv(x, y)) x else merge(x, y)

def mergeAll(x: Foo*) =
  x.reduce(maybeMerge) // <-- oops, not intended to compile
```

`scala.math.Equiv.universalEquiv` should be deprecated and moved to `scala.math.Equiv.Implicits.universalEquiv`.

`scala.math.Equiv.Implicits` could also contain an implicit version of `scala.math.Equiv.fromComparator`.
Do you also agree on adding `fromComparator` again as an opt-in implicit? It has been removed in a seemingly unrelated commit: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/cc1f6bca81c9f524952b4b42b45d8e36d8df6387
