{{partest}} compares raw output from Runner invocation, including warnings from the VM potentially unrelated to the test being run. This can result in false positives.

For example, if my system-wide {{_JAVA_OPTIONS}} includes {{-XX:+UseLargePages}}, it is to be expected that partest's parallel invocations will exhaust the reserved space for large pages on my system, triggering an [ENOSPC|http://www.ioplex.com/~miallen/errcmp.html]. Here is one output of {{partest --show-diff   --presentation}}

{code}
testing: [...]/files/presentation/ide-bug-1000349                     [  OK  ]
testing: [...]/files/presentation/callcc-interpreter                  [  OK  ]
testing: [...]/files/presentation/hyperlinks                          [FAILED]
1d0
< Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: Failed to reserve shared memory (errno = 28).
{code}

Problems:
- this is a head scratcher until run with {{--show-diff}}
- while {{+UseLargePages}} is of limited use with {{partest}}, [it has its use cases|http://zzzoot.blogspot.ch/2009/02/java-mysql-increased-performance-with.html] as a system-wide setting, as do many other edgy options.
- in general, we may not want to let VM _warnings_ fail tests by themselves.
One fix Idea from Martin : could {{partest}} accept a filter file, or a regular expression filter as a configuration parameter ?

That way it would remove lines that match that particular filter from the program's output before comparing it to the {{.check}} output. This also solves the issue of not being able to predict all possible VM routine warnings (and it would probably allow us to remove some garbage in tests' check files).
This is related to the problem (which I haven't solved) of system-dependent file paths in output.  Paul patched that by normalizing backslashes, but that affects other output like \u0022.

I have an experimental "modeline"-style feature for configs. It was motivated by scalacheck options, e.g.:
{code}
/*
 * scalac: -deprecation
 * scalacheck: -workers 1 -minSize 0 -maxSize 4000 -minSuccessfulTests 5
 */
{code}
For config specific to a test, it avoids extra files; my other idea was to process "enclosing" .flags files, e.g., presentation.flags.

Either in a .flags or header, {{filter: Java HotSpot}} or similar as a line-oriented filter.

Or {noformat}map: _ replaceAll ('\\','/'){noformat} or similar would be fun.

The other thing I noticed it that we compare stdout + stderr.  It would be nice to be able to diff only stdout.  I see my code uses a ProcessLogger (I forget that Process API as soon as I use it).



https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2591

The commit uses a filters file for all tests, or all of a kind.

The other use case would be to turn off the inliner warning for everything; right now, a handful of tests specify that filter in a source header.
