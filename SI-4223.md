= problem =
Currently there is no syntax coloring/highlighting in the REPL.

= analysis =
Having syntax coloring/highlighting in the REPL would be very helpful for reading the code, spotting typos and other mistakes.

It would also be a great thing for beginners who are still learning the language and need some visual guidance.

= enhancement recommendation =
Add syntax coloring/highlighting to the REPL.
Coloured prompts have been proposed by @puffnfresh in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3993, assigning this ticket to him.
