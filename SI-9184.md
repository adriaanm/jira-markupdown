```scala
sealed trait A

object A {
  private def hello = ""

  sealed abstract class C(whatever: String) extends A
  case object Y extends C(hello)

  val cs = Vector[C](Y)
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(A.Y eq A.cs.head)
    println(A.cs.head eq A.Y)
  }
}
```

Compile with -Xcheckinit and run it. You will see that object A.Y has been created twice, leaving us with a case where A.Y₁ != A.Y₂.

The detail of what's happening is described here by sjrd:
https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/1490#issuecomment-75952083

It's basically due to initialisation order. A warning emitted by -Xcheckinit would be very helpful.
