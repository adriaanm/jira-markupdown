The implementation has always been behind a -Y option, and for 2.10.0 I labeled it in an even more threatening fashion:
```
  -Ynotnull                           Enable (experimental and incomplete) scala.NotNull.
```
So as far as I'm concerned we should deprecate the empty scala.NotNull trait for 2.11.0 but we are within our rights to remove all of the implementation which underlies it immediately.
