Double.NaN == Double.NaN is supposed to be false.  (It's false in java too.) There is a problem with NaN, but you're not illustrating it here, and I don't think we can fix it anyway.  That is that java decided to make the boxed NaNs return true on equals while keeping the primitive == false.  Since we unified those worlds we can't satisfy both.  See scala/bug#2598.

If you really want to find NaN you need to look for it differently.
```scala
scala> Array(Double.NaN) indexWhere (_.isNaN)
res0: Int = 0
```
