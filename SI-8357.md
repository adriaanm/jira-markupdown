Apparently structural types and implicit conversions don't play along very well; see the following repro (directly runnable on the Scala console):

```scala
scala> type Structural = { def size: Int }
defined type alias Structural

scala> import scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce
import scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce

scala> implicit def genericTraversableOnce2HasSize[ T ]( gto: T )( implicit ev: T => GenTraversableOnce[_] ): Structural = ev( gto )
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
genericTraversableOnce2HasSize: [T](gto: T)(implicit ev: T => scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[_])Structural

scala> def test( v: Structural ) { println( v.size ) }
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
test: (v: Structural)Unit

scala> test( Some( 1 ) )
java.lang.StackOverflowError

```

I couldn't tell you why, but this works around the problem:

```scala
scala> implicit def genericTraversableOnce2HasSize[ T ]( gto: T )( implicit ev: T => GenTraversableOnce[_] ): Structural =
     |   if ( ev == conforms ) gto.asInstanceOf[ Structural ] else ev( gto )
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
genericTraversableOnce2HasSize: [T](gto: T)(implicit ev: T => scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[_])Structural

scala> test( Some( 1 ) )
1
```

This makes no sense though, because the `conforms` call should result in exactly the same behavior. Any help would be appreciated...
It's not related to structural types, nor existentials.

This will also loop:
```scala
trait Foo
trait Sizeable { def size: Int }
implicit def fooHasSize[T](gto: T)(implicit ev: T => Foo): Sizeable = ev(gto)
fooHasSize(new Foo{})
```

-Xprint:typer reveals why:

```scala
implicit def fooHasSize[T](gto: T)(implicit ev: T => Foo): Sizeable 
 = fooHasSize[Foo](ev.apply(gto))(Predef.$conforms[Foo])
```
Foo[Any] is not a Sizeable, per your example, why would this example even compile?
*Update* Well OK, it does compile, but I must be missing something basic because I still don't get *why* this compiles.
`GenTraversableOnce` is now a universal trait, meaning it now extends `Any` rather than `AnyRef` can be a parent of a value class.

This has a unintended interaction with structural types:

```scala
trait T extends Any {
  def size: Int
}
object Test {
  type Structural = { def size: Int }
  def foo(x: T): Structural = x
}
```

```
 found   : x.type (with underlying type T)
 required: Test.Structural
    (which expands to)  AnyRef{def size: Int}
  def foo(x: T): Structural = x
                              ^
```

Because of this, your the result of `ev(gto)` is itself adapted with the very same implicit view that it defines. (We need a lint rule for that!)

```scala
    // -Xprint:typer
    implicit def hasSize[T](gto: T)(implicit ev: T => scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[_]): Test.Structural = {
      val temp: scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[Any] = ev.apply(gto);
      Test.this.hasSize[scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[Any]](temp)(scala.this.Predef.$conforms[scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[Any]])
    };
```

Workaround:

```scala
type Structural = Any { def size: Int }
```

(The "naked" `{def size: Int}` is a shorthand for `AnyRef { def size: Int}`)
Well, *that* I hadn't considered. So if I understand correctly, this should not compile at all, but rather emit an error saying that `GenTraversableOnce[_]` cannot conform to `Test.Structural` because it is not provably a reference type, whereas the lint rule you mention would only act as a safety net for similarly incorrectly-handled edge cases?
Considering the comments above, a cleaner workaround would be writing "AnyRef with GenTraversableOnce[_] "

implicit def genericTraversableOnce2HasSize[ T ]( gto: T )( implicit ev: T => AnyRef with GenTraversableOnce[_] ): Structural = ev( gto )
