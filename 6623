To clarify adriaan's comment for the record (I'm thinking he hooked the tubes up to his head to catch the runoff) it was proposed, I think with general agreement, that case classes with a single parameter list be treated as before, and those with multiple have a copy method which returns the eta-expansion.  An unusually satisfying solution really.
```scala
case class Foo(x: Int)(y: Int, z: Int) {
  <synthetic> def copy(x: Int = this.x) = new Foo(x)(_: Int, _: Int)
}
```
