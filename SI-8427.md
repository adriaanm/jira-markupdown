The in scope view, `ApplicativeIdV` in Scalaz seems to lead to curious results:

```scala
object Test {
  import scalaz.Scalaz._

  val y2: List[(String, Int)] = ???
  
  // erroneous or inaccessible type in 210dbc7~1
  // after 210dbc7~1, we get unexpected inferred types for `apply`.
  // I think this stems from an in-scope implicit making the application
  // viable (via `isCoercible`), even though no view is applied to `x$1`!
  val y3 = y2.map(((x$1: (String, Int)) => scalaz.WriterT.apply(x$1)))

  scalaz.WriterT.apply/* !!! [Any, Nothing, Nothing]*/(("", 0))
}

object TestNoImport {
  val y2: List[(String, Int)] = ???
  
  // both of these give the expected type errors before and after 210dbc7.
  //val y3 = y2.map(((x$1: (String, Int)) => scalaz.WriterT.apply(x$1)))
  //scalaz.WriterT.apply(("", 0))
}

object TestSpecificImports {
  import scalaz.Scalaz.ApplicativeIdV
  scalaz.WriterT.apply(("", 0)) 
}
```

We expect a type error for all of those `apply` calls (as we don't have higher order unification to infer the identity type constructor, `Tuple2[A, B]` ought not to be applicable.

But, `isCompatible` also checks if arguments can be coerced to the formal parameter type with a view.

If you're unlucky enough to have exactly one view in scope that fits the bill, the application is deemed compatible. Views are sought in two phases based on their evaluation strategy: firstly strict and secondly by-name. The view `ApplicativeIdV` is in the second category, and is probably the lone `_ -> _[_]` view in the grab-bag of `Scalaz._`. For reasons that aren't clear to me, it also needs to return a refinement type to trip this bug.

The icing on the cake is the fact that the view actually doesn't get applied, we reinfer the type parameters in `doTypedApply`, and end up with `F[(A, B)]` instantiated as `Any[(Nothing, Nothing)]`, which is just `Any`. The argument `(0, 0)` conforms to this.

Here's a standalone look at this:

```scala
object Standalone {
  trait M[A]
  def writerT[F[_], A, B](fab: F[(A, B)]) = ???
  
  writerT((0, 0)) // type error, as we exped

  {
    implicit def View[A](v: => A): M[A] {} = ???
    writerT/* !!!  [Any, Nothing, Nothing]*/((0, 0)) // no type error
  }
}

```
