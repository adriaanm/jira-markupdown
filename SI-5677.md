only one m, cumulative

also can't edit priority, should be trivial

As a brief diversion from real work, implemented Damerau-Levenshtein
and ran it on trunk to elicit obvious misspellings. Unfortunately
they're mostly in places like compiler comments which real people never
see, but I fixed them anyway. All those English Lit majors who peruse
our sources are sure to be pleased.

As a Lit major, I really was pleased, but it would be even more cool to have
a tool that generated crossword puzzles from scaladoc, so that we could
learn stuff while having a bit of extraneous fun.
(Aside from the intrinsic fun of learning Scala.)


While that commit is deeply satisfying to not only Lit majors, it doesn't appear to have fixed this particular error.

Indeed as at the time of writing the error [is still there|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/library/scala/collection/GenTraversableLike.scala#LC94]
What I should have said: Maybe it would be useful to scan for typos periodically in scaladoc comments.  If there were a build target to do it, applying the corrections could be a community effort.

Fixed in pull request [#415|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/415] / commit [b5d583063e995a2054fa3fde3b190ee4ffa843f5|https://github.com/heathermiller/scala/commit/b5d583063e995a2054fa3fde3b190ee4ffa843f5]
