A tale of 2 repls:

```
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_112).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/foo").mkString
res0: String =
"Foo!
"
```

And then in 2.12
```
Welcome to Scala 2.12.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_112).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/foo").mkString
<console>:12: error: object Source is not a member of package io
       io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/foo").mkString
          ^
```
Cannot reproduce - maybe there's an `io` folder somewhere in your setup? if I `mkdir io` i get the same message as in the example. Closing for now, feel free to re-open.
Recalling the classpath change, if you can repro, try -YclasspathImpl:flat with 2.11.

```
scala 2.11.8> $intp.settings.YclasspathImpl
res0: scala.tools.nsc.Settings#ChoiceSetting = -YclasspathImpl = recursive
```
