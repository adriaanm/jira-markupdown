Experimenting with RichString's methods on 2.7.4 interpreter, I found that linesWithSeparators does not return the type specified in the API at scala-lang. The API specifies the same return type os lines, ie, Iterator[java.lang.String]. Instead, the follow type is being returned:

scala> "abc" linesWithSeparators

res64: java.lang.Object with Iterator[String]{def len: Int; def index: Int; def index_=(Int): Unit} = non-empty iterator

The return type you see is in fact an Iterator[String], so the documentation is correct.  There is no requirement that the return type of a method be exactly what is stated in the documentation, only that it conform to it.  (Were that a requirement, a very high percentage of methods would fail that test.)
{code}
scala> val x: Iterator[String] = "abc" linesWithSeparators 
x: Iterator[String] = non-empty iterator
{code}
