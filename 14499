Consider the following example:
```scala
var i = 1
def add(x: =>Int)(y: Int) = x + y
val f = add(i) _

f(1)    // => 2
i += 1
f(1)    // => 2!!!
```

I would expect the second f(1) to return 3, since the value of i has been incremented.  It would seem that the partially-applied form of add (f) is memoizing its call-by-name parameter.
