@retronym the #3992 PR seems a lot more ambitious (and correspondingly controversial, side-effect-ful, etc) than what I'm after.   

Although what I'm proposing is arguably a bit prolog-like, it seems within the bounds of standard implicit resolution logic, imo.

Far as I can tell, the addition of commutivity logic works properly, with the exception that it seems to activate a different code path on failure that doesn't honor `implicitNotFound`.  That itself seems like a bug to me, although I'm curious about more expert opinion there.
