{noformat}
import scala.annotation.tailrec

class TailRec {
  Some(new AnyRef) map { phooie =>
    @tailrec
    def inner(i: Int): Int =
      inner(i + 1)
    
    inner(0)
  } getOrElse 42
}
{noformat}

The {{inner}} function in the above code will be compiled into the following bytecode:

{noformat}
  private final int inner$1(int);
    Code:
       0: aload_0       
       1: iload_1       
       2: iconst_1      
       3: iadd          
       4: invokespecial #23                 // Method inner$1:(I)I
       7: ireturn  
{noformat}

Needless to say, {{invokevirtual}} != {{goto}}.  This was a _silent_ failure of the tailrec optimization.  No warnings were emitted by the compiler.  This bug was found against 2.9.2 and later reproduced against a fresh build of the 2.10.0-RC1 tag.

Hilariously, removing the {{getOrElse 42}} resolves the issue, and the compiler is able to compile the tail recursive call into a jump.

Given how _pervasive_ this "@tailrec inner function" idiom is within the standard library, akka, and myriads of code bases (including Precog), this seems like a very serious issue.  It basically implies that a lot of code that people _think_ is safe will actually explode for sufficiently large datasets.
This is a complete showstopper for Precog; we use @tailrec *everywhere* and this misbehavior has us currently sitting right in the middle of a minefield.
Kris is not exaggerating when he says that this would involve thousands of lines of refactoring.  You're right that this ticket wouldn't exist if the compiler had told us about this issue, since we would have caught the issue early and never would have written our code in this fashion.  However, the fact is that the compiler _didn't_, we _did_, and now we're in a very serious mess.  I doubt that we're the only ones.

The fact is that this is a silent failure of the worst sort.  It is a bug in the compiler that introduces a failure condition in your code that is likely to _only_ exist in production (where you see realistic dataset sizes).  Compiler bugs are bad enough.  Silent compiler bugs are worse.  Silent compiler bugs that are only identifiable by reading the bytecode are worse still.  Silent compiler bugs that cause your code to crash _only_ in production are DEATH.

My point is this: even though there is a workaround, it's not one that is practical for many people (including us).  Even if it were, this bug needs to be fixed.  There is almost certainly a lot of code out there, right now, that is broken without anyone knowing.  People can't use a workaround if they don't know they have a problem.
