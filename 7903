Dominik,

I understand that in order to compile successfully that DerivedJava must be declared abstract. The DerivedJava class is there to demonstrate an *expected* compilation failure. The description doesn't make sense if DeclaredJava compiles, so I have returned the description to its original state. The class is not "used" except as an example of where javac should (and does) fail to compile.

The compiler does *not* flag an error on DerivedScala, which is the point of the bug report.
