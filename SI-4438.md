=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

For example:

```scala
   scala> List( 1, 2, 3 ).redu<tab>
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

I should see the following options:

```scala
   reduceLeft          reduceLeftOption    reduceRight         reduceRightOption
```


=== What do you see instead? ===

```scala
   <console>:1: error: illegal start of definition
```

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 and 2.9.0.RC1
  - Java: 1.6.0_20
  - Operating system: 10.6.4
On 2.10.0.r24908-b20110508020204 too. Actually this one exists for a long time already.

`Array(1,2,3)` has the same problem.
This is fixed in the [Ammonite REPL](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL)

```scala
@ List( 1, 2, 3 ).reduce<TAB>
reduce              reduceLeft          reduceLeftOption    reduceOption        reduceRight
reduceRightOption
@ List( 1, 2, 3 ).reduce
```
