I propose the Either ADT similar to Haskell's Data.Either. I also propose adding some functions to scala.Function (id and const), which are used in the implementation of Either.

Please note that the submitted patch has been thoroughly tested using ScalaCheck, but because of some slight changes to the proposal (from the original, which uses many more libraries), I have not included these tests. They can, however, be shown or even adapted to this proposal.
I screwed up. Please see Ticket SI-251
