Hey all,

It looks like `>>` is acting like `>>>` when inlined.

This bug showed up in an sbt 0.13.12 project running Scala 2.11.8. I compiled a file containing this object, with `-optimize` enabled:
```scala
object Bug {
  @inline def inlineShift(x: Int): Int = x >> 1
  def shift(x: Int): Int = x >> 1
}
```

Then started a console with `sbt console`, and found the following discrepancy between the behavior of the two functions:
```scala
scala> Bug.inlineShift(Int.MinValue)
res0: Int = 1073741824

scala> Bug.shift(Int.MinValue)
res1: Int = -1073741824

scala> Int.MinValue
res2: Int = -2147483648
```

The functions both returned `Int.MinValue` when I removed the `-optimize` flag.
