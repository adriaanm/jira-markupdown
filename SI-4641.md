At the top of the left panel in Scaladoc there are links named "# A B C D...". The link corresponding to "#" is broken in the APIs published on scala-lang. The name in the filesystem is "index-#.html" and the text links to "index/index-%23.html", but the Apache server does its own rewriting, and the intended page can only be reached by using the link "index-%2523.html".

Having file names containing the '#' sign may easily lead to problems, as the character has special meaning in URLs; ideally, a different file name should be used for that page.
(kzys in [r25077|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25077]) The '#' sign may easily to lead to problems, So we use '_' instead of '#'. Closes #4641.
(kzys in [r25329|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25329]) Fixes SI-4641 again. But we should move this code from JavaScript to Scala side.
