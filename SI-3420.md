(In r21994) Test case for SI-3420, closes SI-3420.  Review by dragos.
(In r22261) Made getters treated more like private members when debating
whether to inline.  Closes SI-3420, review by dragos.
(In r22276) Closes SI-3420, typo in scaladoc for BigInt. No review.
(In r22291) A love letter to the inliner.  This attempt to fix SI-3420 may
more closely approximate fixedness.  Review by dragos.
