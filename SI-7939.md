I have a use of DelayedInit that is compiling but throwing NoSuchMethodError at runtime. I was unable to figure out how to reproduce it without Akka and ScalaTest, but it seems to be a compiler issue. 2.10.0 seems to have the same issue as 2.10.3. I have attached a tgz file with a simple sbt project that shows the problem. If you do this:

tar xvzf - delayedInitProb.tgz
cd delayedInitProb
sbt test

You should see that it compiles fine but two runtime failures occur because of:

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.scalatest.fixture.NoArg$class.apply$mcV$sp(Lorg/scalatest/fixture/NoArg;)V

The apply() method on ActorSys should be calling the applyI() method in NoArg. Trait NoArg is defined in ScalaTest as:

trait NoArg extends DelayedInit with (() => Unit) {

  private var theBody: () => Unit = _

  /**
   * Saves the body of the constructor, passed as <code>body</code>, for later execution by <code>apply</code>.
   */
  final def delayedInit(body: => Unit) {
    theBody = (() => body)
  }

  /**
   * Executes the body of the constructor that was passed to <code>delayedInit</code>.
   */
  def apply() { theBody() }

  /**
   * This method exists to cause a compile-time type error if someone accidentally 
   * tries to mix this trait into a <code>Suite</code>.
   *
   * <p>
   * This trait is intended to be mixed
   * into classes that are constructed within the body (or as the body) of tests, not mixed into <code>Suite</code>s themselves. For an example,
   * the the main Scaladoc comment for this trait.
   * </p>
   */
  final val styleName: Int = 0 // So can't mix into Suite
}

What apply seems to be doing, according to javap, is calling a synthetic method named public void apply$mcV$sp();, which is one of several apply methods that seem to be specialized on the result type. The body of apply$mcV#sp() tries to invoke:

//Method org/scalatest/fixture/NoArg$class.apply$mcV$sp:(Lorg/scalatest/fixture/NoArg;)V

Well that indeed does not exist, hence the runtime error. This did work at some point, but I'm not sure if what changed was the compiler or perhaps Akka has added something in the meantime.
I suspect that you compiled Scalatest with `-nospecialization`.

Looking at the bytecode of NoArg:

```
> test:console
scala> :javap org.scalatest.fixture.NoArg
Compiled from "NoArg.scala"
public interface org.scalatest.fixture.NoArg extends scala.DelayedInit,scala.Function0{
    public abstract void org$scalatest$fixture$NoArg$_setter_$styleName_$eq(int);
    public abstract scala.Function0 org$scalatest$fixture$NoArg$$theBody();
    public abstract void org$scalatest$fixture$NoArg$$theBody_$eq(scala.Function0);
    public abstract void delayedInit(scala.Function0);
    public abstract void apply();
    public abstract int styleName();
}
```

I copy/pasted the code into my the test project, compiled, and looked at the bytecode:
```
scala> :javap MyNoArg
Compiled from "MyActorSpec.scala"
public interface MyNoArg extends scala.DelayedInit,scala.Function0$mcV$sp{
    public abstract void MyNoArg$_setter_$styleName_$eq(int);
    public abstract scala.Function0 MyNoArg$$theBody();
    public abstract void MyNoArg$$theBody_$eq(scala.Function0);
    public abstract void delayedInit(scala.Function0);
    public abstract void apply();
    public abstract int styleName();
    public abstract void apply$mcV$sp();
}
```

Here was my test (independent of Akka)

```scala
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val sys = new Delayed("a")
    sys.apply()
  }

  class Delayed(name: String) extends fixture.NoArg { // works with extends MyNoArg
    override def apply() {
      super.apply()
    }
  }
}

trait MyNoArg extends DelayedInit with (() => Unit) {

  private var theBody: () => Unit = _

  /**
   * Saves the body of the constructor, passed as <code>body</code>, for later execution by <code>apply</code>.
   */
  final def delayedInit(body: => Unit) {
    theBody = (() => body)
  }

  /**
   * Executes the body of the constructor that was passed to <code>delayedInit</code>.
   */
  def apply() { theBody() }

  /**
   * This method exists to cause a compile-time type error if someone accidentally
   * tries to mix this trait into a <code>Suite</code>.
   *
   * <p>
   * This trait is intended to be mixed
   * into classes that are constructed within the body (or as the body) of tests, not mixed into <code>Suite</code>s themselves. For an example,
   * the the main Scaladoc comment for this trait.
   * </p>
   */
  final val styleName: Int = 0 // So can't mix into Suite
}
```
