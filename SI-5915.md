Sometimes a method returns a type that is not publicly visible, but which has an ancestor which is. This can be seen quite often on the reflection API docs, such as all {{Type}}-returning members of scala.reflecti.api.Types.TypeApi.

In such cases, it would be very useful if the link to a publicly visible ancestor was made available.
