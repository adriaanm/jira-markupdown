  code goes here
{code} 

I downloaded scala 2.8.1 from the download page.
On a code where I do string1 + string2 an exception is thrown: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/StringBuilder

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The exception should not be thrown.


=== What do you see instead? ===
Exception thrown is unexpected.

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)
I checked that the jar scala-library.jar does not contain the relevant class file. (I could find this class in 2.7.7 build that came with Eclipse plugin.)

Attaching scala-library.jar along with.


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 lzpack installer and tgz both
  - Java:
  - Operating system: 
Look, you're compiling against something else.  scala.StringBuilder is a type alias in 2.8.1.  Somehow thousands of other projects use 2.8.1 just fine, and the error you're seeing points directly at the issue, which I already told you.   Please don't reopen this ticket.
