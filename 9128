So, as it currently is, it is impossible to ask for the execution of a command supported by one shell but not other shell - that would be portable, anything else is not portable. Right?
So, as it currently is, it is not possible to have the script:
import util.Properties._
"/bin/rm " +userHome + "/.kderc" !
In that case, the current offering would be secure. But if the current offering does allow such code, then it is not secure.
Yes, things are not so easy are they?

The current implementation is neither portable nor secure;
what I suggest is simply more flexible.
If you believe the current implementation is just fine the way it is,
I don't want to argue. My wrapper is so obvious and useful I imagine that someone will simple create a github version of it and that will be that.
