If I generate some Javascript in my Scala code like this:
```xml
<script type="text/javascript">
     foo("{bar}");
</script>
```

and the Javascript contains a double quote character (like in the example), it will appear as {noformat}&quot;{noformat} when the XML is converted into a string by toString, and Firefox will reject this Javascript as having a syntax error.

I don't think it's simply a matter of needing to subsequently replace all of the quot entities with double quotes, either, because some of them might actually need to stay escaped (if they are inside attribute values).
