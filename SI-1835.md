After updating to the latest nightly, Eclipse hung. I killed it, restarted it, it came back with a ConcurrentModificationException. (I attach the log). I looked at bak_logs, there are 9, aqll with the same exception. Now Eclipse refuses to start again :-(
Can you tell me the version string of the Eclipse plugin? This looks exactly like #1763 and #1776 which should have been fixed by the defensive copy added in r17385 ... the stacktrace you provided looks as I would expect if that fix wasn't included in the build you're working with.
