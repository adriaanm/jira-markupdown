Under -implicits, scaladoc is blind to views that take a by-name parameter.

This is why #:: and #::: are absent from Stream. It would also be nice if they bore some doc, of course.
{code}
import scala.language.implicitConversions
trait X { def x(): Unit = ??? }
class Test
object Test {
  implicit def f(t: => Test): X = new X { }  // no x member
  //implicit def f(t: Test): X = new X { }   // ok
}
{code}
