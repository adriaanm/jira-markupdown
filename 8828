Looks like trees were behaving like this for ages, given that they have their `equals` overriden as follows:
```scala
override def equals(that: Any) = this eq that.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
```

By the way I found something that might be of interest: Tree.equalsStructure.
```scala

scala> Ident(newTermName("x"))
res0: $r.intp.global.Ident = x

scala> Ident(newTermName("x"))
res1: $r.intp.global.Ident = x

scala> res0 == res1
res2: Boolean = false

scala> res0.equalsStructure(res1)
res3: Boolean = true
```
