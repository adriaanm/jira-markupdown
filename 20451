The [documentation for Scaladoc|https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tags+and+Annotations] expressly states that multiple @note tags are supported. However, there are several problems when multiple @note tags are used:

1. When rendered to HTML, these notes are combined into a single note, with the paragraph body of each note separated by a line containing a single comma.

2. The separate @note elements are not rendered where they appear in the body text, but all the notes are rendered together, possibly at the location of the first @note. This may perhaps be intentional, but makes it impossible to note important points within a larger discussion.

3. The @note elements are rendered in reverse order.

Thus, the following Scaladoc markup is rendered as shown in the attached screenshot:

{noformat}
* Some body text.
  *
  * @note This is the body of the first note.
  *
  * Some more body text.
  *
  * @note This is the body of the second note.
  *
  * @note This is the body of the third note.
{noformat}

(Observe also that the ‘Note’ label in the screenshot is not rendered as boldly as it should be, due to the Bold/Italic variants of the Open Sans font not having been embedded in the generated HTML. See [SI-10235|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-10235].)
