The {{Failure}} {{rescue}} method is

{code}
  def rescue[U >: T](f: PartialFunction[Throwable, Try[U]]): Try[U] =
    if (f.isDefinedAt(exception)) f(exception) else this
{code}

which will leak exceptions if {{f}} throws them.  Should be

{code}
    try { /* current code */ }
    catch { case NonFatal(e) => Failure(e) }
{code}
