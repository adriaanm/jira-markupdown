The `Failure` `rescue` method is

```scala
  def rescue[U >: T](f: PartialFunction[Throwable, Try[U]]): Try[U] =
    if (f.isDefinedAt(exception)) f(exception) else this
```

which will leak exceptions if `f` throws them.  Should be

```scala
    try { /* current code */ }
    catch { case NonFatal(e) => Failure(e) }
```
