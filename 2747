In both cases the expected result type is Unit. Could you please give an example of how these two methods can be called? I have tried the following, all of which fails (presumably because the return type is the same for both methods?)
```scala
  bar(5): Unit
  val u1: Unit = bar(5)
  bar(5)(2f): Unit
  val u2: Unit = bar(5)(2f)
```
