The @varargs anno exhibits some weird behaviour that apparently has to do with types being present, I guess. This code compiles with no issues:

```scala
scala> def test[A](x: A, repeated: String*): A = x
test: [A](x: A, repeated: String*)A
```

while this one does not:

```scala
scala> @annotation.varargs def test[A](x: A, repeated: String*): A = x
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : x.type (with underlying type A)
 required: A
       @annotation.varargs def test[A](x: A, repeated: String*): A = x
                               ^
```

My use-case is a bit more involved, as my actual signature is more along the lines of:

```scala
@annotation.varargs def test[A <: SomeType](x: A, y: Future[_ <: SomeType]*): Future[A]
```

but I guess it boils down to the same issue.
Duplicate of #8743. Verified that the fix also works for this example.
