I got exacly the same error but without any 'isInstanceOf' in my source code. I cannot report about the error context, because I actually don't no where it occurs (I got no context information from the compiler). I can reproduce the bug in scala-ide 2.0.0.201105131126-beta4-92f1b27 as well as in sbt 0.7.7.
(scala-version: 2.9.0, java-version: 1.6.0_25)
