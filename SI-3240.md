```scala
val foo = new {
  type t
  def apply(a: Option[t], defVal: Any) = {
       a.getOrElse(defVal).asInstanceOf[t]
     }
}
```


yields


```scala
...
     at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$TypeRef.typeSymbol(Types.scala:1618)
     at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$TypeRef.typeSymbol(Types.scala:1618)
...
```
This code is actually incorrect, and before the infinite loop, an error is printed:

```scala
error: only classes can have declared but undefined members
         type t
              ^
```

I imagine that the error situation breaks an assumption that is later used in the implementation of typeSymbol (i.e. that normalising a type alias does not yield the same type).
(extempore in [r25281](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25281)) Don't enter into same line infinite recursion when erroneous
code involves a self-normalizing type alias.  Closes #3240, review by moors.
