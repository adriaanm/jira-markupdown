= analysis =
With Scala 2.8 collection classes living in package scala were moved to the appropriate collection packages. 

The handling of Arrays has been improved compared to versions earlier than 2.8 and is more or less fully integrated into the collection framework now.

= enhancement recommendation =

Considering that Array is primarily used for collection-oriented tasks (compared to String, where a similar argument won't apply, because it is not primarily used for collection-oriented tasks) it should be moved to scala.collection.mutable.

To stay compatible, appropriate additions to package objects/Predef should be made like it was done in 2.8.

This would be a nice cleanup and would reduce the beginner confusion about "why is there no collection.mutable.Array?".
This should have begun life as a mailing list discussion, not a ticket.
