The following code 
```scala
   null match { case x: AnyRef => 1 case _ => 0 }
```
gives <console>:5: error: unreachable code. On the other hand, tricking it into acceptance like this
```scala
   scala> (null: Any) match { case x: AnyRef => 1 case _ => 0 }
   res10: Int = 0
```
gives 0, so clearly the second case was reachable. 
There are variations of the same problem. Here is another one:
```scala
scala> def foo[T](x: Array[T]) = x match {
     |   case y: Array[AnyRef] => 1
     |   case y: Array[Int] => 2
     | }
<console>:6: error: unreachable code
         case y: Array[Int] => 2
                               ^
```
