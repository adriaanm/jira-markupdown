Works in 2.9.x fails in trunk.

{noformat}
object Test {
  def ==(p: Phase): Int = 0

  def foo {
    ==(new Phase())
  }
}

class Phase
{noformat}

leads to
{noformat}
Test.scala:6: warning: object Test and Phase are unrelated: they will most likely never compare equal
    ==(new Phase())
      ^
one warning found
{noformat}

I guess it gets confused about the receiver of == and doesn't take into consideration that it can be overloaded.
