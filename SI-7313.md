If I try to compile the following code:
{code}
trait A {
   def f(i: Int): Int
}

object B extends A {
 def f(implicit i: Int) = i
}
{code}

I get error:

{quote}
error: object creation impossible, since method f in trait A of type (i: Int)Int is not defined
{quote}

Same with class:
{quote}
error: class B needs to be abstract, since method f in trait A of type (i: Int)Int is not defined
{quote}


The point in the current implementation that checks this:

{code}
      case mt1 @ MethodType(params1, res1) =>
        tp2 match {
          case mt2 @ MethodType(params2, res2) =>
            // sameLength(params1, params2) was used directly as pre-screening optimization (now done by matchesQuantified -- is that ok, performancewise?)
            mt1.isImplicit == mt2.isImplicit &&
            matchingParams(params1, params2, mt1.isJava, mt2.isJava) &&
            matchesQuantified(params1, params2, res1, res2)
{code}

Originally introduced in 2005 by Martin: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/0baff37#L30R834

The spec is silent:
{quote}
Two method types(ยง3.3.1) are equivalent if they have equivalent resulttypes, both have the same number of parameters, and corresponding parameters have equivalent types. Note that the names of parameters do not matter for method type equivalence.
{quote}

Assigning to Martin for clarification; it seems to me like it's intentional and the spec needs an update.
