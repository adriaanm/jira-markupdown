{code}
class P {
  1 to
  //comment
  5
}
{code}
This code shouldn't compile, because there are two new line chars between "1 to" and "5" and such code looks weird to be compilable (other thing is about block comments, which explicitly contains new line chars).
I just found another important case (to continue discussion):
{code}
def foo(x: Int)(y: Int) = 1

foo(1)/*
*/(2)
{code}
This is not compilable, however it seems it should be compilable.
However imagine that this code is ok, then such code also will be ok (because of newline included in comment):
{code}
foo(1)//line comment
(2)
{code}

So something about comments is wrong or not specified.
All of these compile:
{code}
  Nil map // foo
  identity

  Nil map
  // foo
  identity
  
  Nil map
  // foo
  // foo
  identity
  
  Nil map /* foo 
  */ identity
  
  Nil map /* foo */
  identity
  
  Nil map /* 
  foo 
  */
  identity
  
  Nil map /* 
  foo 
  foo
  foo
  */
  identity
{code}
But THIS does not (compare with last example.)
{code}
  Nil map /* 



  */
  identity
{code}
So you can make code uncompilable by changing the content of the comment, without even changing the number of newlines in it! It looks like a completely blank line is being counted as an nl token even if it's inside a block comment, but a line with any non-whitespace is not.

I can find pretty much nothing on how comments translate into whitespace in the spec.
From the spec, as unearthed on the recent  mailing list thread:

Normally, only a single \code{nl} token is inserted between two
consecutive non-newline tokens which are on different lines, even if there are multiple lines
between the two tokens. However, if two tokens are separated by at
least one completely blank line (i.e a line which contains no
printable characters), then two \code{nl} tokens are inserted.

As per suggestions on the thread, we will change this to:

Normally, only a single \code{nl} token is inserted between two
consecutive non-newline tokens which are on different lines, even if there are multiple lines
between the two tokens. However, if two tokens are separated by a character sequence containing at least one completely blank line (i.e a line which contains no printable characters), then two \code{nl} tokens are inserted. (it does not matter if the blank line appears within a comment or outside of it)
