Yes, I believe that:
```scala
  final def encode(line: Int, column: Int): Int = {
    checkInput(line, column)
    
    if (line >= LINE_MASK)
      LINE_MASK << COLUMN_BITS
    else
      (line << COLUMN_BITS) | math.min(COLUMN_MASK, column)
  }
```
would be correct.

The old cold before r24717 used:
```scala
if (column > COLUMN_MASK)
  column1 = COLUMN_MASK
    else 
  column1 = column
```
and encoded with `column1`.

I think Paul who committed r24717 would be able to quickly confirm whether this was a typo.

I'm attaching a sample test that shows that 2.8.0 to 2.9.RC1 return `1:5` as position of the error while r24777 returns `1:1`
