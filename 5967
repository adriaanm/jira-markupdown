Here's a minification of the `TerminationService` case (failing in the pull request):
```scala
object Outer {
  class Tester
  private[Outer] trait B4 { _: Tester =>
    protected val FREQ = 23
    def fail() = {
      println(FREQ)
    }
  }
  object C4 extends Tester with B4
}
```

Note the necessity of `private[Outer]`.

This is a case which still worked in 2.9.0.RC1. So there might be another possibility: The original issue was something else but the original fix then started to mask issues.
