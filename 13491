How very exciting! Scala is the first language I’ve programmed in which has a Unicode character, ⇒, as one of the built-in language operators!

However, in ‘for’ statements, one must still use primitively-constructed ASCII arrows, as in {{for(v <- blah) stuff}}. Please can you allow {{for(v ← blah) stuff}}.

Also, for writing pairs, {{key → value}} would be nice.

Thank you very much.
