Import statements and class constructors doesn't mix well. For example, this works fine:
{code}
object TestObject {
  def x = 3
}

class TestClass(i : Int) {
  def this() = {this(TestObject.x)}
}
{code}
but doesn't:
{code}
class TestClass(i : Int) {
  import TestObject.x
  def this() = {this(x)}
}
{code}
this doesn't work either:
{code}
class TestClass(i : Int) {
  def this() = {import TestObject.x; this(x)}
}
{code}
I find this behavior inconsistent with normal import rules.

To me, the spec is very clear on this point.

The signature and the self constructor invocation of a constructor definition are type-checked and evaluated in the scope which is in effect at the point of the en- closing class definition, augmented by any type parameters of the enclosing class and by any early definitions (ยง5.1.6) of the enclosing template. The rest of the con- structor expression is type-checked and evaluated as a function body in the current class.

These could work:

{code}
scala> object O { val X = 0 }
defined module O

scala> class T(i: Int) { def this() {this {import O.X; X}} }
defined class T

scala> class T(i: Int) { def this() {this(1); import O.X; println(X)} }
defined class T
{code}
