= problem =
Currently scalac allows to apply any annotation to anything.
This creates several problems:[[BR]]

 * scala is more expressive than java, so its not always clear without to which entity annotation really belongs[[BR]]

 * some java tools are very "surprised" (up to crash) finding METHOD or CTOR annotations on say classes[[BR]]

 * annotation misplacing getting visible only at runtime. Its really cumbersome to manually detect this fact (via runtime error)

= analysis =
Searching tickets on this topic i've found several related issues, some of them with @field annotation. 
It seems that a special @target annotation (just like in java) will make things more clear in this area:

 * it will be clear (i.e. in many cases even without @field) who should get annotation, private field of method
 
 * developer will know about misplaced annotation in compiletime

= enhancement recommendation =
I propose to 
 * add java like @target annotation to scala library with all possible target values as argument and All as special (and default) value. 

 * as the next step, complier should emit warning or error (depending on options) if annotation is misplaced.

 * when it is unclear what to annotate use @target as hint if there is only one right variant
The following should be accompanied with examples:

 * scala is more expressive than java, so its not always clear without to which entity annotation really belongs

* annotation misplacing getting visible only at runtime. Its really cumbersome to manually detect this fact (via runtime error)

The sample is scala API itself. Take a look at
[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/annotation/target/package.html the target package] and its classes (so called meta annotations). They are introduced just as a hint to which element of a definition compiler shall apply annotation. However, compiler makes now checks is this appliance valid or not.

Here the "classical" example is ctor annotation. Most people write

{code}
@annot
class MyClass(a: A) {}
{code}
instead of 
{code}
class MyClass @annot()(a: A) {}
{code}

and compiler gives even no warning despite that annotation has ctor @target. I understand that this case completely depends on language knowledge and developer's attention, but all people have mistakes and it's compiler's job to detect as many as possible.

Oh, I've just remembered a better sample for the second case. Using DI or AOP its easy to misplace annotation (since you use many of them), say @Inject

{code}
@Inject
class MyComponentImplementation {}
{code}

Although annotation @Inject have Method|Ctor|Field target, scala compiler will give you nothing on this and you will detect this error only at runtime (upon dependency resolution).
