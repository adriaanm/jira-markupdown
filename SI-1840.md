this is a bad one; I won't be able to report other bugs on the trunk until it's fixed.

```scala
  ~/nl/new> cat p/J.java 
package p ;
class J { J() { } }
  ~/nl/new> cat p/S.scala
package p
class S { new J }
  ~/nl/new> ~/scala.trunk/dists/latest/bin/scalac p/J.java p/S.scala 
p/S.scala:2: error: p.J does not have a constructor
class S { new J }
          ^
one error found
```

I'm on the trunk at r17402.

Maybe related to #1836 .
This is definitely caused by the fix for #1240.  I sort of see what is happening, and I am not at all surprised (as you can see from my comments in that ticket.) The problem is that by correctly restricting the access to package private, anything which doesn't check access correctly is liable to break -- if for instance it naively assumes that something flagged PRIVATE is actually private and not perhaps package private.

The internal compiler interface for access checks is way too low level, inconsistent, and complicated, and even if I can fix this one I expect there will still be many bugs.

In this bug, nonLocalMember in Typer returns the constructor as expected without the fix for 1240, but fails to do so after the fix because it has the LOCAL flag.  As I understand things, you should never be checking the LOCAL flag without also checking whether privateWithin is NoSymbol, because if it isn't the meaning of "local" has dramatically changed.  Sketchy is an understatement.

I am very reluctant to bandaid this any further, as I believe what the compiler really needs is a massive reduction in flag access.  I would go so far as to say that flags should be made private to Symbol and all checks and manipulations should be forced to go through accessors.
I could convince partest to compile things by leaving out the package folder. Pending test in pending/pos/t1840.
You might want to try that for #1240 as well, Paul. I think test cases for those things are crucial.

I agree about test cases.  The problem in #1240 is that the bug is only induced if the files are compiled sequentially, and I couldn't see how to make partest first compile a java file, then compile a scala file without looking at the java source, and then attempt to run a program and verify the output (because it's a runtime error.)
