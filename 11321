That thing where you want to know if it's a named arg or an assignment.

The workaround is to supply the type of the payer variable.

Mini-me of https://github.com/cheeseng/scalatest-compile-error/blob/without-scalatest/src/test/scala/payment/InvoiceSpec.scala
```scala
    locally {
      val p = Payment(payer = Some("payer"))

      val invoice = Invoice(None, Some(p))

      val payer = invoice.payment.get.payer
      //val payer: Option[String] = invoice.payment.get.payer
    }
```
Unhappy:
```
    scala.this.Predef.locally[Unit]({
      val p: payment.Payment = Payment.apply(scala.Some.apply[String]("payer"));
      val <invoice: error>: <error> = Invoice(None, Some(p));
      val <payer: error>: <error> = <invoice: error>.<payment: error>.<get: error>.<payer: error>;
      ()
    })
```
