I expect the following code to compile without errors:
```scala
trait Elem {
    type Peer
}

trait Impl[E[~] <: Elem {type Peer = ~}] {
    def foo[R](peer: E[R]#Peer)

    foo[Int](??? : E[Int]#Peer)
}
```

Instead, an error is given that:
```text
Error:(12, 18) type mismatch;
 found   : this.scala.Peer
    (which expands to)  Int
 required: this.Peer(in method foo)
    (which expands to)  R
    foo[Int](??? : E[Int]#Peer)
             ^^
```

It looks as if the variable `R` is not getting substituted in the structural refinement part of the type.
