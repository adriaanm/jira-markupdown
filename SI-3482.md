For r22040: open scaladoc, click 'display packages only'

Result: every package has two links: 'hide' and 'focus'. To show a package user is forced: 1). to click 'hide' (nothing changes except for replacing 'hide' with 'show'), 2). to click this new 'show' link

Expected result: those 'hide' links must be replaced with 'show' ones (with appropriate semantic change) as a result of 'display packages only' clicking.
