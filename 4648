Let's see, that's a lot of material to comment on:

currentThread: OK to deprecate everywhere. Why did we introduce it in the first place? Seems low-level.

Type aliases: I think there was a policy to import everything of value from java.lang so that we can eventually remove java.lang from the default imports. Another reason for this was platform independence. So I would leae things as they are until we see clearer on both counts.

Add Manifest companion objects and optManifest method: yes, good idea.

format can be deprecated and replaced by formatted.

I am not sure about the read methods. They are used less often than the print methods but are symmetric to them. So I'd tend to leave things as they are. No big deal to leae them in, therefore the upsets caused by changing things around would weigh more heavily.

exit should definitely be deprecated.

error shuld probably be deprecated as well.

I'd hold back with deprecations until 2.9. 

Cheers
