I never would have imagined that this could be considered beautiful, but by comparison...
```scala
    String.format(self, args.toList.toArray[Any].asInstanceOf[Array[AnyRef]]: _*)
```
I'm not sure why it was using reflection until now even in the 1.5 RichString, but I think this version in r17203 doing everything the other one was except tempting cthulu to return.
