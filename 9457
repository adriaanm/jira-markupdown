BONUS CONFOUNDING FACTOR!

After grek couldn't reproduce it, I had to kick a little harder. The behavior only materializes if you skip locker. It uses 2.10.1 for starr, and that is enough to make it go boom.

So from a clean checkout of origin/2.10.x:
{code}
ant -Dlocker.skip=1 build
./build/pack/bin/scala -nc -e 'class B { 0 max 0 }'
{code}
It is fairly disturbing that the delta between 2.10.1 and current 2.10.x is a) enough to break things in the absence of locker and b) break them in a way which is basically impossible to connect to the cause unless you're one of a tiny handful of people. So we had better do something about this somewhere - abandon the idea of skipping locker, or greatly hardening the lockerless build.
