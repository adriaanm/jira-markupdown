note, this does cause compilation failures in multi-module builds where the module is several steps removed from the module where the object is referenced. Out initial symptom for instance was of the form:
```
[error] bad symbolic reference to io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction.Functions encountered in class file 'SQSAction.class'.
[error] Cannot access type Functions in object io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction. The current classpath may be
[error] missing a definition for io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction.Functions, or SQSAction.class may have been compiled against a version that's
[error] incompatible with the one found on the current classpath.
[error] /work/aws-scala/sqs/src/test/scala/io/atlassian/aws/sqs/SQSSpec.scala:48: value ok is not a member of object io.atlassian.aws.sqs.SQSAction
[error]         _ <- handles.headOption.map { h => SQS.changeVisibility(url, h, Duration(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) } getOrElse SQSAction.ok(())
[error]                                                                                                                              ^
```
