jpsacha: I don't think this SI-8198 related, but see SI-6169 for much further discussion.  It isn't a bug in the JavaFX API, because some of the bounds that it infers yield unspeakable existential types in Java, mostly on the *Builders.  With a fix for 6169, your interactions with JavaFX types should get smoother and less casty overall.
