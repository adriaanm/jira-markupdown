Using Scala 2.8.0.r20873 on Java 1.6,

As discussed on mailing list: http://old.nabble.com/Scopes-td27568723.html.

Given the following sources:

A.scala
{code}
package P { object X }
package Q { object X }
{code}

B.scala
{code}
package P {
  object A {
    import Q._
    println("L7: " + X)
  }
}
{code}

The reference to X in P.A should be ambiguous because the wildcard import has lower precedence than the definition of P.X.  If the code is in a single file instead of two, scalac generates the proper error:

{code}
error: reference to X is ambiguous;
it is both defined in package P and imported subsequently by 
import Q._
      println("L7: " + X)
                       ^
{code}
