[Elided very sloppy report, replacing with substance.]
```scala
import scala.actors.Actor._

object Test {
  val impl: Actor = actor {
    loop {
      react { 
        case 1 => impl ! 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Notice scala.actors.Actor is not imported.  scalac crashes during compilation, but only if continuations are enabled.
