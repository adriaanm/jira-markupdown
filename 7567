I just found another important case (to continue discussion):
```scala
def foo(x: Int)(y: Int) = 1

foo(1)/*
*/(2)
```
This is not compilable, however it seems it should be compilable.
However imagine that this code is ok, then such code also will be ok (because of newline included in comment):
```scala
foo(1)//line comment
(2)
```

So something about comments is wrong or not specified.
