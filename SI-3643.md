Given the code:
```scala
foo({ (a : Int) =>
  val b = a+1
  b
})
```

scala-mode will indent the code as follows:
```scala
foo({ (a : Int) =>
  val b = a+1
     b
   })
```

The cause of the problem appears to be in scala-mode-indent.el:124.  The condition (> block-after-spc block-start-eol) is false in this case, but the "then" block is the one that should be executed.
