"Test(42)" should be semantically equivalent to "val t = Test; t.apply(42)".  Or, equivalently, "val t = Test; val x = t.x; t.apply(42)".  If x is free of side-effects, then **all** of these should be semantically equivalent.  However, the first one will fail to invoke the companion object constructor, while the third (and I believe the second) will.
