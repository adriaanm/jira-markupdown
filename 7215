Getting "optimized stability" to run uncovered a bug, resulting from actually emitting as private fields that had been marked to be public. That's why an `IllegalAccessError` could still happen, in spite of running programs (compiled with optimization) with optimized libraries. 

I hope this brings confidence in the inlining policy (the focus of our discussions). The policy is fine, an aspect of its implementation was wrong.

Commit [bff1efd6093d43 ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/commit/bff1efd6093d43daaf79817b2dfc23276b0f4b58) fixes that bug (that bug is a blocker for optimized stability). It would be great if you could review the commits in the [recoveringOptimizedStability ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/recoveringOptimizedStability) branch.
