The spec says Byte is weakly conformant to Char, and the implementation agrees:
{code}
scala> val x: List[Char] = List((-5).toByte)
x: List[Char] = List(?)

scala> x.head.toInt                         
res7: Int = 65531
{code}
Is that intentional? Half the Byte values don't fit inside character.  I would vote that it is not conformant, but there is a bug either way: if Byte is conformant to Char, then surely Short is as well.

I think the spec still needs an update.
Indeed. I have been meaning to go over it and add this and other missing 2.8 bits.
