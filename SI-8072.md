The implicit scope reaches so far and wide, and this little line:

{code}
trait TraversableLike[+A, +Repr] extends Any
...
with Parallelizable[A, ParIterable[A]]
{code}

we include the package object of `collection.parallel`.

Just say NO to:

 - implicits in package objects
 - package implementation details in package objects (even private[package], which is still importable)
 - implementation details that are left public
