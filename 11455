I didn't mention that this is a breaking change because any code relying on {{Try.get}} throwing the original exception will break.

My reasoning why this change is still a net-improvement is that you can always match on an expression of type `Try[T]` to get out the original error message if you want to. Relying on try/catch to get failures out of a {{Try}} should be considered an anti-pattern anyways.

Calling {{Try.get}} itself is an anti-pattern, but again on the other hand recovering the stacktrace of the thread calling Try.get / Await.result is impossible if the call is buried inside any third-party library and then debugging is next to impossible.
