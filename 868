I agree on the finite element thing, so how about _Collection_ instead of _Seq_?

Also, as I mentioned in the beginning: I can understand that there are reasons to leave _* as Seq, but then one should add another apply method to the immutable _Set_ object:

{{def apply [A]( other : Collection[A] ) : Set[A] = ..}}


P.S. Stream extends Collection and the latter one is documented to be finite to, so I thought exceptions are fine.
