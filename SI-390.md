For Java development, ctl+shift+o (command+shift+o on OSX) organizes the imports used/needed in a Java source file. The net effect is that only/all imports for classes used within the source file are listed alphabetically at the top of the source file. Wildcard imports are expanded, unused imports are dropped, and missing imports (required for classes actually used in the file) are added. In the case of ambiguity (e.g. use of unqualified List type), a dialog containing all relevant types (e.g. java.util.List, com.sun.tools.javac.util.List, and java.awt.List) is displayed and the user is prompted to select the type to import. There has been discussion on the [scala] mailing list re having equivalent functionality in the Scala plugin.

I use this feature *constantly* in the Java IDE, and have felt somewhat handicapped without it in Scala.

In a Scala editor, what it seems to do is still call the Java-source version (does that make it a defect?)  It will still pull in imports to the extent that your Scala code may also resemble valid Java. 

class Foo extends Group { val x = new Color()  } // two imports
class Foo(val y: Int) extends Group { val x = new Color() } // one import
class Foo(val y: Int) extends Group { val x = new Color }   // no imports

It would be great if it were not a pain to reuse some of the existing mechanism, while updating to recognize types in Scala syntax...
