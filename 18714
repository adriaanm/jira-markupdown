I tried to call the method "insert" on an "org.squeryl.Table[E]", but I got this compilation error:

[error]  found   : E
[error]  required: org.squeryl.Query[E]
[error]             underlyingTable.insert(newEntity)

The problem was not, in fact, this. In fact, a Query[E] is *not* required, because the insert method is overloaded to also take an E. The real problem, I think, was that the return type of the insert method that takes an E did not match the required return type inferred from the return type I had given the method. Once I added another line immediately after this one, the error disappeared.
