Using the following code:
```scala
object Test01 extends Application {
        val ls = List(1, 2, 3)

        ls.for|
}
```

and (at the "cursor" | position) type Ctrl-Space, the code completion writes:
```scala
       ls.format(text, xs)  
```
(I was looking for a legal "foreach", so the automatic code completion is incorrect)                    

but if you type "ls.fo" and type Ctrl-Space, the Content Assist window shows up with the correct options (including the desired "foreach"). If you then type "r", the options are correctly reduced, but if at this point you type Ctrl-Space to circle through other templates like SWT or JPA, the default Scala template does not show the correct options anymore, listing only "format".

Environment: Eclipse 3.5.2, JVM 1.6.0_18, Scala Plugin 2.8.0.r21376
