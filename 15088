The spec says Byte is weakly conformant to Char, and the implementation agrees:
```scala
scala> val x: List[Char] = List((-5).toByte)
x: List[Char] = List(?)

scala> x.head.toInt                         
res7: Int = 65531
```
Is that intentional? Half the Byte values don't fit inside character.  I would vote that it is not conformant, but there is a bug either way: if Byte is conformant to Char, then surely Short is as well.
