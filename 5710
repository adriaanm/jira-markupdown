@Extempore: It's good news to know how to bypass the restriction with current Scala versions. But I would propose to enhance the documentation: _withPositioning_ has no Doc-Text and -- maybe I'm here alone, but I doubt it -- it's difficult to find this solution, if you're not one of the library developers. Thus, this might be prominently explained in the description of Source.
