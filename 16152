In section 8.2 we read:
```
A type variable pattern is a simple identifier which starts with a lower case letter.
However, the predefined primitive type aliases unit, boolean, byte, short, char,
int, long, float, and double are not classified as type variable patterns.
```

However, the primitive type aliases mentioned have been removed. The last sentence should be deleted from the spec.
