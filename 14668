In the following the @param tag is not recognised by scaladoc if the source file's line endings are CR LF. All is well with LF endings.

{code}
/**
  * Convert time in seconds to a Time quantity.
  * 
  * @param secs time in seconds
  * @return the time in microseconds
  */
def secondsToTime(secs: Double): Time = (1000000.0*secs).toLong
{code}

In fact it is the first @tag that is ignored.

Environment is OS/X (with some text editing under Windows).
