Here is another one.  The icode checker would crash finding an unexpected type on the stack, and I eventually pinpointed that it is calculating strange lubs.  Here is a line from SymbolLoaders:
{code}
sym.setInfo(if (ok) NoType else ErrorType);
{code}
Both NoType and ErrorType have Type as a superclass, so one would expect the type of that expression to be Type.  However when calculating the lub, what it actually calculates is Product.
{code}
Pushing: REFERENCE(scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$NoType)
meet2 created new stack: (List(REFERENCE(scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$NoType)),
List(REFERENCE(scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$ErrorType))) =>
List(REFERENCE(scala.Product))
{code}
The implementation is merely:
{code}
global.lub(t1 :: t2 :: Nil)
{code}
Before erasure the lub shows up as Product with Type.  If I read the spec correctly it's allowed to not order this with the class first; but if that is indeed allowed, there must be some interface which utilizes intersectionDominator in erasure so the right type pops out, because I can't see when "Product" is ever what you'd want.

A seemingly simpler and more direct answer is to organize compound types with the class first all the time.  Maybe there's a reason not to do that.
An illustration of the calculated lub from everyday scala land:
{code}

scala> abstract class Tom
defined class Tom

scala> case object Bob extends Tom
defined module Bob

scala> case object Harry extends Tom
defined module Harry

scala> List(Bob, Harry)
res0: List[Product with Tom] = List(Bob, Harry)
{code}
This looks like it could be a duplicate of SI-3868.

Funny, it's been doing the lub that way since scala 0.minus-infinity and we come in two days apart in the late 3000s.  Yes, it's a duplicate.  I know you were dying to close it.  Go ahead, it is rightfully yours.  I'll just go over here and oh, I don't know, FIX THE LUB!
There is no one 'right' lub after erasure, unfortunately. This is one of the reasons we still don't have a jvm6 backend. Add two methods to your example:

{code}
  def moo(x: Tom) {}
  def moo2(x: Product) {}
  moo(if (c) new Bob else new Harry)
  moo2(if (c) new Bob else new Harry)
{code}

I agree the lub should list classes first, but it won't solve the icode checker issue. The best way would be to simply make the icode checker less precise, and use the JVM notion of subtyping (which basically considers any interface type to be `Object`). 
(In r23131) Modified typekinds to offer a more general lub when it encounters
interfaces so it does not end up in a disagreement with the jvm.
References SI-3872, but modifying the compiler lubs is not yet done.

In case the goal was computing lubs as needed to emit 1.6 classfiles (ie version 50 and up), that's been solved in

Background, quoting from http://gallium.inria.fr/~xleroy/publi/bytecode-verification-JAR.pdf

--- start quote ---
The simplest solution to the [least upper bound of] interface problem is to be found in Sunâ€™s implementation of the
JDK bytecode verifier. (This approach is documented nowhere, but can easily be inferred by
experimentation.) Namely, bytecode verification ignores interfaces, treating all interface types as
the class type Object. Thus, the type algebra used by the verifier contains only proper classes
and no interfaces, and subtyping between proper classes is simply the inheritance relation between
them. Since Java has single inheritance (a class can implement several interfaces, but inherit from
one class only), the subtyping relation is tree-shaped and trivially forms a semi-lattice: the least
upper bound of two classes is simply their closest common ancestor in the inheritance tree.

I'm closing this ticket as Not-a-bug because its underlying assumption, namely that {{TypeKind.lub}} should be used in the jvm6 backend, simply doesn't hold and never will. 

Instead {{TypeKind.lub}} is fine for the uses it is called for ({{GenICode}}, {{ICodeCheckers}}, and type-flow analysis). In fact, for those uses, {{TypeKind.lub}} _should stay as-is_.

As an aside, the following excerpt from {{GenASM}} shows how lubs are computed the JVM way:

{noformat}
  @inline final private def jvmWiseLUB(a: Symbol, b: Symbol): Symbol = {

    assert(a.isClass)
    assert(b.isClass)

    val res = Pair(a.isInterface, b.isInterface) match {
      case (true, true) =>
        global.lub(List(a.tpe, b.tpe)).typeSymbol // TODO assert == firstCommonSuffix of resp. parents
      case (true, false) =>
        if(b isSubClass a) a else ObjectClass
      case (false, true) =>
        if(a isSubClass b) b else ObjectClass
      case _ =>
        firstCommonSuffix(superClasses(a), superClasses(b))
    }
    assert(res != NoSymbol)
    res
  }
{noformat}
