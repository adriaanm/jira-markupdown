=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Have two traits, one of which has an abstract method. Write a pattern-match expression, as below, where you first match trait A (with a pattern guard), then trait B, then trait A again. If you pass in an object that extends both A and B, and does NOT pass the boolean guard, the second match is skipped and the third match is selected. If you remove the first match (with the pattern guard) the behavior is as expected.

Basically, the presence of one failing match is causing the following match to fail, which it shouldn't.

     |     case _:Bar => 2
     |     case _:Foo => 3
     |   }
     | 
     |   matchParent(Spam(3))
     | }
res0: Int = 3

scala> {
     |   trait Foo  {
     |     def i: Int
     |   }
     |   trait Bar
     | 
     |   case class Spam(i: Int) extends Foo with Bar
     | 
     |   def matchParent(p:Any) = p match {
     |     case _:Bar => 2
     |     case _:Foo => 3
     |   }
     | 
     |   matchParent(Spam(3))
     | }
res1: Int = 2
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Both of the above expressions should resolve to 2.

=== What do you see instead? ===
The first expression resolves to 3, skipping the second match.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC1 (also occurs in 2.8.1)
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: OS X 10.6.7
The problem seems to be introduced in the "explicitouter" compiler stage:
```scala
    def matchParent(p: Any): Int = {
      <synthetic> def gd2(x$$1: com.wtf.Main.Foo): Boolean = x$$1.i().==(1);
      {
        <synthetic> val temp5: Any = p;
        if (temp5.isInstanceOf[com.wtf.Main.Foo]())
          {
            if (gd2(temp5.asInstanceOf[com.wtf.Main.Foo]()))
              {
                1
              }
            else
              {
                3
              }
          }
        else
          if (temp5.isInstanceOf[com.wtf.Main.Bar]())
            {
              2
            }
          else
            throw new MatchError(temp5)
      }
    };
```
It appears the generated code branches on whether it's an instance of "Foo" first, only branching based on the guard after it's determined it will match one of the "Foo" cases.
Yes, `matchParent(Spam(3))` returns `3` when defined as 

```scala
  def matchParent(p:Any) = p match {
    case f:Foo if f.i == 1 => 1
    case _:Bar => 2
    case _:Foo => 3
  }
```

However when compiled with `-Ypmat-naive` it returns `2`. 

The other option that comes to mind (`-Yno-squeeze`) makes compiled code return `3`.
