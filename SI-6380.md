Currently only @throws(classOf[Exception]) is supported.

@throws[Exception] improves on the code before:

 - more concise and readable
 - source compatible (didn't check it yet)
 - actually enforces that we are throwing a Throwable, and not a String

Care is taken that the addition doesn't break anything. Because the serialization stays the same, it won't even change anything on the binary compat front.
