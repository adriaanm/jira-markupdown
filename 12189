This issue relates to scala/bug#5265, which tackles the problem of order-relevant implicits by displaying a warning whenever an implicit def doesn't specify its return type. This works for implicit defs, however as my example demonstrates, there are other cases in which the order-relevance of implicits leads to hard-to-fix error messages, and the suggested warning wouldn't cover those cases.
