The problem is that for methods like the *Set* constructor a *Iterable* should be fine but one needs a *Seq*. this can result in a unneeded copy with *toSeq* created, e.g. a new *List*:

```scala
object Main extends Application
{
  import collection.Set
  import collection.immutable.Set
  
  
  val a = Set(1,2,3,4) // or any val a : Iterable[Int]
  val b = Set(a toSeq : _*) //  a toSeq ) == List(1,2,3,4)
}
```

Of course the alternative would be to create create new additional constructors for classes like *Set*, but I vote for the other solution because *Iterable* has *toSeq*..
I agree on the finite element thing, so how about _Collection_ instead of _Seq_?

Also, as I mentioned in the beginning: I can understand that there are reasons to leave _* as Seq, but then one should add another apply method to the immutable *Set* object:

`def apply [A]( other : Collection[A] ) : Set[A] = ..`


P.S. Stream extends Collection and the latter one is documented to be finite to, so I thought exceptions are fine.
