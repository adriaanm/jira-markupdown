In 2.8.0, 2.8.1.RC3 and trunk, if there are only classes that are private within an enclosing package:
```scala
package a
private[a] class T
```

scaladoc throws an error about no documentable classes in compilation units:
```scala

```

Additionally, it throws the error when the only inputs are package objects:
```scala
package object a
```

The first case is an issue because I might have a subproject that is only used internally and not exported as an API.  Or, it might not have public classes yet.  I don't want to have to disable running documentation against the subproject and then remember to enable it when there are valid classes.

The second case is an issue because I have a top-level subproject with the only purpose being integrating implicits and other definitions into a package object for users.  It has no other sources, so this error occurs.

Obviously it is easy to workaround this by adding a public dummy class.
(In r24194) [scaladoc] Scaladoc no longer crashes upon realising there is nothing to document. Closes #3928. No review.
