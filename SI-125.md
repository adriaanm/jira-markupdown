In the new Scala Eclipse Plugin there is a severe performance degradation when a list is declared as:
{code}
  val aList = (
    elem1 ::
    elem2 ::
    elem3 ::
    Nil)
{code}
I have such a list with 28 records and it was impossible to compile! (I had to copy&paste my program part by part into the new plugin in order to pinpoint that place where it "hangs").
The workaround is to use the List(elem1, elem2, elem3) form.
Fixed for next beta (B5). Note that you are still going to encounter stack overflows when the list gets to a hundred or so elements (depending on what your stack limit is). This is an intrinsic limitation in NSC, which can't handle large constants lists very well because of type inference. Would personally avoid large consts lists if possible, and use a list buffer instead.
