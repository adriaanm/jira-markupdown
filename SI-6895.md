Suppose we have the following two type classes, an instance of the first for an either-like trait, and a way of building instances of the first from some specific instances of the second:

```scala
trait Foo[F[_]]
trait Bar[F[_], A]

trait Or[A, B]

implicit def orFoo[A] = new Foo[({type L[X] = Or[A, X]})#L] {}
implicit def barFoo[F[_]: Foo] = new Foo[({type L[X] = Bar[F, X]})#L] {}
```

Now we can define a couple of type aliases:

```scala
type StringOr[X] = Or[String, X]
type BarStringOr[X] = Bar[StringOr, X]
```

And get an instance of our first type class:

```scala
scala> implicitly[Foo[BarStringOr]]
res1: Foo[BarStringOr] = $anon$1@4b5a1133
```

But when we try the same thing with a type lambda, we get an error:

```scala
scala> implicitly[Foo[({type L[X] = Bar[StringOr, X]})#L]]
<console>:14: error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: Foo[[X]Bar[[X]Or[String,X],X]]
              implicitly[Foo[({type L[X] = Bar[StringOr, X]})#L]]
                        ^
```

I asked [a question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13996601/334519) about this last week, but haven't gotten any answers, and I haven't been able to find any previous issues that address the problem (a comment on my question points to [this open improvement](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-2712), but I don't see how this could be a type constructor inference issue).
Type lambdas are cool and all, but not a single line of the compiler was ever written with them in mind. They're just not going to work right: the relevant code is not robust. I spent a day or so looking at #5294 not long ago and it was too hard to fix; this is probably a duplicate. I doubt there are more than three people right now with any chance of fixing this stuff and all of us have a bunch of higher priorities, so if this is important to you I suggest rolling up your sleeves (this would be in the "way, way up" position) and seeing what you can do.
Here's a cut down reproduction.

```scala
trait Foo[F1[_]]
trait Bar[F2[_]]
 
class Test {
  def barFoo[F3[_]]: Foo[F3] = ???

  // Now we can define a couple of type aliases:
  type M[X1] = String
  type N[X2] = Bar[M]

  // val ok1: Foo[N] = barFoo
  // val ok2: Foo[({type L[X] = Bar[M]})#L] = barFoo[N]
  val nok: Foo[({type L[X3] = Bar[M]})#L] = barFoo /* Type inference can't unify F with L */
}

```
I've analysed this further and realised that this is not a bug, but rather a manifestation of the limitation of higher kinded inference, #2712.

I've submitted my analysis as a test case: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4569
