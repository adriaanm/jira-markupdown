At the momemt it's impossible to deconstruct blocks in a fashion like:
```scala
val q"{ ..$stats; $last }" = q"{ a; b; c }"
```
The underlying problem is that quasiquotes only know how to reify splices with increasing cardinality. Here $last has smaller cardinality than previous ..$stats one and the pattern fails to compile.
