We can't detect looping programs in general, so the compiler can't really do anything (useful enough) about this in general.


since this is not a bug, could you please move the discussion to the scala mailing list / stack overflow?
I'm afraid we must allocate our JIRA-related resources to bug discussion only, sorry.
