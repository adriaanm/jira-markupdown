Can you tell me the version string of the Eclipse plugin? This looks exactly like scala/bug#1763 and scala/bug#1776 which should have been fixed by the defensive copy added in r17385 ... the stacktrace you provided looks as I would expect if that fix wasn't included in the build you're working with.
