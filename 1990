The behavior in views is as expected. The ticket is still correct in that override makes  no sense here. In fact, the spec says that overrid9ing simply cannot apply for traits or classes. This is one thing that might be revised in future versions of Scala. So, with that in mind, we still need to update the spec. But it's not super urgent to do so.

Thanks, Mark, for raising the point, though.
