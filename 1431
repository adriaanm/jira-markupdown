> Are you able to reproduce this outside of Eclipse using the command line tools?

I've been tackling this problem for a month. The command line compiler works fine. And the plugin will work ok if you clean the project and rebuild.

When I have to edit the files with this code partern, I keep getting stack overflows. So what I do is edit, save, clean project and let it rebuild. Otherwise the code is not really generated on a save. 

Looks to me like something in the way the plugin inspects the code generated is not write. The code compiles on rebuild and Command line scalac.
