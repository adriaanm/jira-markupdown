Performance-wise, it's better to keep as straight-line code what can be formulated that way. You know, if two basic blocks:
- are back to back, and
- the former jumps to the second, and
- no other block jumps to the second, and
- no exception handler covers one but not the other, 

then it's better to keep them as a single basic block. 

I don't know what to make of "avoiding emitting tiny switches". In the example, a "tiny switch" isn't being emitted anymore, yet there are two intervening jumps. Reverting [c2cd6acf99](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/c2cd6acf993d66eac6f6917ee3b7300eeaceb8a3) would mean we get even more jumps, right? Doesn't seem like a good idea.

Any more comments?
