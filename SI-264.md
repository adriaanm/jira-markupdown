The Scala compiler will (correctly) compile the following:

```scala
case -1 =>
```

but the definition of '{{Pattern}}' in the SLS does not allow it:

```scala
Pattern ::= Pattern1 { ‘|’ Pattern1 }
Pattern1 ::= varid ‘:’ TypePat
           | ‘_’ ‘:’ TypePat
           | Pattern2
Pattern2 ::= varid  [‘@’ Pattern3]
           | Pattern3
Pattern3 ::= SimplePattern
           | SimplePattern {id [nl] SimplePattern}
SimplePattern ::= ‘_’
                | varid
                | Literal
                | StableId
                | StableId ‘(’ [Patterns [‘,’]]
                | StableId ‘(’ [Patterns ‘,’]
                | ‘(’ [Patterns [‘,’]] ‘)’
                | XmlPattern
Patterns ::= Pattern {‘,’ Patterns}
```

I can only guess at the correct definition but the following may work:

```scala
Pattern3 ::= SimplePattern
           | SimplePattern {id [nl] SimplePattern}
           | PrefixExpr
```

Where `PrefixExpr` is constrained to be a constant expression, as in annotations.
-1 is an integer literal. I updated the spec to say this.
