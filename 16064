Under 2.9.0.RC1, the compiler appears to be confused by semicolon as a path separator when the classpath is specified on the command line. It is not confused under 2.8.1.final.

To reproduce, on Windows:

  * Create a subdirectory `foo` containing a file `Foo.scala`, and a subdirectory `bar` (sibling to `foo`) containing a file `Bar.scala`. They might look like the attached files.

  * In the parent directory of `foo` and `bar`, try compiling:
```scala
  scalac -cp foo;bar foo\Foo.scala bar\Bar.scala
```

This works as expected under 2.8.1.final, but under 2.9.0.RC1 reports:
```scala
  error: source file 'bar' could not be found
  one error found
```
