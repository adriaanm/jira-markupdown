Wow, I guess I am really surprised that 2.10.0-M3 would be
released without first fixing this show-stopper.
I'd like to incorporate some of the new features being
highlighted in the 2.10.0-M3 but can not because a couple
of my libraries have failed to compile for over a month
due to the "fix" 19a48510c.
I kept waiting for this to be addressed so that I could
go back to using the git-head rather than  2.10.0-M2.
