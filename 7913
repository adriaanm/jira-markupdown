Lukas is correct.  In 2.10 you can still get away with typing in the above (it's more broken in 2.9) but the copy method is not assigned the type (String*) => SureItIs, it is given the type Seq[String] => SureItIs.

The varargs star can only appear in method types, not function types.
{code}
scala> def f(xs: String*): Int = 5
f: (xs: String*)Int

scala> f _
res0: Seq[String] => Int = <function1>

scala> class A { def g: ((String*) => Int) = f _ }
defined class A

scala> (new A).g _
res1: () => Seq[String] => Int = <function0>
{code}
