I think it's really a shame that `mutable.Queue` doesn't have this, so if you can do it in a source-compatible way, that sounds good to me!  However, something like `.enqueue(xs: _*)` would still need to work to maintain source compatibility.  Adriaan is the one to ask if we want a performance vs. backwards compatibility tradeoff.  (I think an implicit will do the trick, but it's a bit ugly to have in the API...maybe better to just wait until 2.13 and fix it properly.)
