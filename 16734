Consider such code

    val x = Some(5)
    val y = 5

    println(x==y)

"false" will be printed. Actually, Scala compares those entities in such way that it will be ALWAYS false, so it is indication user didn't want to write the way she/he did (same case when you compare Int to null for example -- you will get at least warning). But here -- nothing, compiler happily compiles the code.

Possible solutions:
a) compiler should evaluate None == Value always to false, and Some(Value) == Value always to true (I prefer such solution)

b) forbid comparing Option[T] to T (compiler error)

b.1) or at least warning
