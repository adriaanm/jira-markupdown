Also while <ins><ins>: doesn't exist in Seq, we've changed </ins></ins> in BufferLike to create a new buffer (instead of appending to the current one) so I think that if ++: is going to exist for buffers, it should work in a similar fashion.
```scala
@migration(2, 8,
    "As of 2.8, ++: always creates a new collection, even on Buffers.\n"+
    "Use ++=: instead if you intend to add by side effect to an existing collection.\n"
)
final def ++:(xs: Traversable[A]): This = xs ++=: clone()
```

Also I just realized that in the +: definition the migration message should say "Use +=: ..."
