Actually that was kosher with cygwin. The issue that Jason have, I also had using scala.bat last night which I was going to mention until I realized it is SI-4614 (so I think it's been there since at least May 19).

I was trying to put a github pull request together to facilitate merge but ran into issues with git line ending issues (crlf).

The fix mentioned by Kevin works.
