If you use Nothing, the type system cannot help you because you aren't telling it what you're doing, which is building and composing a special kind of computation.   But no matter how many times I point this out you don't seem to listen, so I'm not going to bother with you or this ticket any further.  

I appreciate all the points you are making but they are not making sense to me. of course, It could be me here.
However if Scala language & compiler authors want to convince people of when/how to use Nothing type properly and the relation to implicit conversions, then there is a need to make this information known in the Language Specification first, then the books, then also in the standard libraries. In the meantime it would seem users will keep getting surprised as I have.
What I end up doing is creating a loopWhileCont method which explicity performs my => Nothing conversion & otherwise I think I'm happy with Nothing type at this point in my lib design/usage.
Will I follow your advice to move away from Nothing at later time -- not until I see the advantages/disadvantages in favor of it.
(Of course if i see a redesigned actors library with your recommendations and its advantages then i might reconsider also.)
