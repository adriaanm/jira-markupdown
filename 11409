bq. {{scala/Product}}  isn't present as a class constant in the bytecode.
Oh, I had completely missed that; that's very wrong.  And it happens for any interface:

{code}
trait Foo

trait Foo1 extends Foo

class A extends Foo1 with Foo
{code}
{code:bash}
% javap -v A.class | grep '= Class.*Foo' # where is Foo...
#6 = Class              #5             // Foo1
{code}

This seems to have regressed in Scala 2.9.2:

{code:bash}
% java -jar ~/Downloads/proguard5.0/lib/proguard.jar \
  -dontshrink \
  -dontoptimize \
  -dontobfuscate \
  -dontpreverify \
  -dump \
  -injars ~/scaladev/packs/scala-v2.9.1-1/pack/lib/scala-library.jar'(scala/Tuple1.class)' \
  | grep 'Interfaces' -A 4
Interfaces (count = 4):
  - Class [scala/Product1]
  - Class [scala/ScalaObject]
  - Class [scala/Product]
  - Class [scala/Serializable]
% java -jar ~/Downloads/proguard5.0/lib/proguard.jar \
  -dontshrink \
  -dontoptimize \
  -dontobfuscate \
  -dontpreverify \
  -dump \
  -injars ~/scaladev/packs/scala-v2.9.2/pack/lib/scala-library.jar'(scala/Tuple1.class)' \
  | grep 'Interfaces' -A 4
Interfaces (count = 2):
  - Class [scala/Product1]
  - Class [scala/Serializable]

Constant Pool (count = 184):
{code}
