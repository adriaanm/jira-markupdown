`Builder.mapResult` returns an anonymous proxy that forwards most method calls to the target builder and overrides `result` to apply a function to the target Builder's result. Unfortunately this proxy does not forward `sizeHint` and related methods. This causes excessive copying and oversized buffer allocations when mapped Builders are used ({{ArraySeq}} uses a mapped Builder so this situation is not uncommon).

The fix is easy: add
`def sizeHint(size: Int) = self.sizeHint(size)`
to the mapResult proxy.
