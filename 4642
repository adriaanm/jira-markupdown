    val it = Stream("a", "b", "c").map { letter =>
      println("map " + letter)
      letter
    }.iterator

    println("hasNext")
    it.hasNext
    println("next " + it.next())
    println("hasNext")
    it.hasNext
    println("next " + it.next())
    println("hasNext")
    it.hasNext
    println("next " + it.next())
{code}
Actual Output :
{code}
map a
hasNext
next a
hasNext
map b
next b
hasNext
map c
next c
{code}

Expected outout: 
{code}
hasNext
map a
next a
hasNext
map b
next b
hasNext
map c
next c
{code}

It is totally unexpected that the Head element is treated differently than the others, from the user point of view it feels like operations are not executed lazily on the head element, because they are executed before the actual iterator.hasNext method call.
