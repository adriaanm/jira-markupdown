The one-argument form of {{Regex.split(toSplit)}} was added as of SI-2191. It would be nice to have the two-argument form as well: {{Regex.split(toSplit, limit)}}, since {{java.util.regex.Pattern}} has both forms.

[Pull request 142|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/142] closes this issue.

Daniel's comment was due to [this thread|https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-language/O62zwGq5Ut8/discussion] in the scala-lang list. So I proposed this addition in [this thread|https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-language/Xe_vUh50tvk/discussion], where Martin O. said "no":

bq. I had a look at the two argument form of split. It might be useful but its definitions definitely feels kludgey to me, in partiular how the length argument is arbitrarily interpreted, So I'd prefer we leave it in Java for people to use if they must, but would be reluctant to add this to Scala regex.
