When I comment out an existing line of code with a line comment //, 
the plugin responds with a completion
```scala
//***/ */
```
I.e. the /***/ */ part gets added. The same does not happen when I start a new line
with //.


I can't reproduce this with a recent nightly. Please try again and reopen if you still see this happening.
