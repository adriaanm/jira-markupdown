def++[B](that: GenTraversableOnce[B]): Map[B]:
Returns a new immutable map containing the elements from the left hand operand followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type of the immutable map is the most specific superclass encompassing the element types of the two operands.

But:
val m1 = Map(1 -> 2)
val m2 = Map(1 -> 3)
(m1 ++ m2) ==
expected:
 Map(1 -> 2) // from the left hand
got:
 Map(1 -> 3)
