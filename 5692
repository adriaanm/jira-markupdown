I may have a fix for "0.0 until 0.3 by 0.1".

I'm trying to fix https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8518. I've added a test for it, and have a fix. It also fixes "0.0 until 0.3 by 0.1". Perhaps someone can help me sort out the binary incompatibility warnings? The changes are in:
https://github.com/darabos/scala/commits/SI-8518

Should I send this as a pull request even if it is unfinished?
