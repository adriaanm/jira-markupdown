```scala
trait A {
    def f(a: String): Unit { }
}

trait B[T] extends A {
    def f(a: T): Unit
}

class C extends B[String] {
}

class D extends B[String] with A {
}
```

compiler output:

```scala
hello.scala:9: error: class C needs to be abstract, since method f in trait B of type (String)Unit is not defined
class C extends B[String] {
^
hello.scala:12: error: class D needs to be abstract, since method f in trait B of type (String)Unit is not defined
class D extends B[String] with A {
^
two errors found
```

I think, both C and D are correct classes.

Checked on 2.6.0-final.
Compiler also says that

```scala
class E extends A with B[String] {
}
```

is incorrect.
What's happening here is not what it seems.

```scala
def f(a: String) { }         // this is a concrete method with empty implementation 
def f(a: String): Unit = { } // as is this  
def f(a: String): Unit { }   // but this is parsed as an abstract method and the braces are discarded
```

In other words, if you either insert an equals or remove ": Unit" from the code sample, it works as expected.
