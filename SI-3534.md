Double definition error (RC3 and r22171):
{code}
scala> object Bug {
     |   List[Option[Int]]() match {
     |     case None :: bb :: cc => ()
     |     case x => throw new Exception(x.filter(_.isDefined).mkString)
     |   }
     | }
<console>:8: error: double definition:

Pulling the `x.filter ...` out, not throwing the exception, removing the first case, or not using an anonymous function will make it go away.

In 2.7.7 this crashes the compiler.  It does in RC3 and r22171 as well if there is only one `::`.   It could be two separate issues.

I think it is the same issue manifesting in two different ways.  The pattern matcher is duplicating the default body in the decision tree.  When there are two or more routes to the same body it's supposed to generate a label and have the blocks jump to the label.  In this case it isn't doing that.

In the crashing case, the two bodies look the same to the lifter, so when it looks for the second one it has already removed it from the map, and key not found.

In the other case, they look avoid that crash but they're still generating the same method thus duplicate definition.

I assume it's a pattern matcher bug.  I remember not being clear on what goes into this logic, which predates me:
{code}
      def isLabellable = !cond(body)  { case _: Throw | _: Literal => true }
{code}
But you can see the relevance.
Sure enough, this compiles, and the 1-:: crasher is gone too:
{code}
object Bug {
   List[Option[Int]]() match {
     case None :: bb :: cc => ()
     case x => () ; throw new Exception(x.filter(_.isDefined).mkString)
   }
 }
{code}
The body now being a Block instead of a Throw.
As another point of interest, I changed { case _: Throw | _: Literal } to { case _: Literal } and all tests in trunk still pass.  So if it is achieving something, there's no test case which reveals what it is.  I was curious enough to track it to commit r12521, where the commit tell us "code generation: if pattern body is throw, generate throw directly (no sharing)" but no motivation is given and there are no comments.
(In r22997) Removed Throw from the set of unlabelled AST Nodes. Closes SI-3534,
