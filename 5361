(In r24267) Fix for scala/bug#4188.  I thought it would lead back to me, but it doesn't.
It seems to arise from the changes to inner objects which make them look
like lazy vals.  I am not sure this is the right change but at least
it's only about a six character diff to review.  Closes scala/bug#4188,
review by odersky.
