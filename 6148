You are right, reset fixes the problem.  Furthermore, I did some investigation and discovered the problem is being caused by something goofy I did when I installed the script and jar files onto my machine, and that scala run from the tar file downloaded from the website does not have the problem.

I will close this out.  I apologize for wasting your time.
