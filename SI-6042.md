The code below worked in 2.9.2 but not in 2.10.0-M4.
The return type projection Exp#OpSemExp#Val raises the obscure compile time error "Illegal type selection from volatile type null", so Exp#Val is not seen as a subtype of Exp#OpSemExp#Val anymore. For semantic reasons it is not allowed to remove #Val. It must work like that.

```
case class LamExpWaiter(xs: Seq[Idn]) { 
  def apply[Exp <: LazyExp[_]](e: Exp): Exp#OpSemExp#Val = 
    apply_helper(e.asInstanceOf[Exp#OpSemExp]) 
  def apply_helper[Exp <: LazyExp[Exp]](e: Exp): Exp#Val = 
    e.reify_lam(xs, e) 
} 
```

This issue seems to be a blocker, because the coder has to go to 2.10 for TypeTag, because there is another problem in which Manifest is too limited.

I have narrowed the code below. If I narrow it further then I get errors in 2.9.2 too, so this is the minimal representative (I assume, because I don't know if semantically that statement is true, I don't understand this kind of type level programming) and maybe can be used as unit test. However use the project EDSL as regression test, because there might be some other issue connected that can popup and then is useless for the original coder.

```
class BaseApp[+Exp <: LazyExp[_]](val e: Exp, val x: String) 

trait AbsVal[+Exp <: LazyExp[_]] 

trait LamReifierBase { 
  def reify_lam[Exp <: LazyExp[Exp]](xs: Seq[String], e: Exp): Exp#Val 
} 

trait LazyExp[+This <: LazyExp[This]] {
  type OpSemExp <: LazyExp[OpSemExp] with This 
  type Val <: AbsVal[This] with This 
  type App <: BaseApp[This] with This 

  protected val lr: LamReifierBase 
  def reify_lam[Thiz >: This](xs: Seq[String], e: Thiz): This#Val = 
    lr.reify_lam(xs, e.asInstanceOf[This]) 
}

case class LamExpWaiter(xs: Seq[String]) { 
  def apply[Exp <: LazyExp[_]](e: Exp): Exp#OpSemExp#Val = 
    apply_helper(e.asInstanceOf[Exp#OpSemExp]) 
  def apply_helper[Exp <: LazyExp[Exp]](e: Exp): Exp#Val = 
    e.reify_lam(xs, e) 
}  
```
Somewhat related is #3443.  Relying on two consecutive type projections is probably risky.
I believe that the error is accurate. I've improved the error message a little:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/850

It will now issue:

```scala
 t6042.scala:7: error: illegal type selection from volatile type a.OpSemExp (with upper bound LazyExp[a.OpSemExp] with _$1)
```

The `with _$1` part is the reason we can't project the type `Val`. It corresponds to `with This` in type alias definition, substituted with a existential skolem. 
I indeed found that removing 'with This' in
```
type OpSemExp <: LazyExp[OpSemExp] with This
```
into
```
type OpSemExp <: LazyExp[OpSemExp]
```
did make the error go away and then projecting on Val is possible.
but it probably means something else.

But is the type selection volatile because of type erasure?
Then the workaround would be to put a typetag somewhere.

Only this
```
trait LazyExp[+This <: LazyExp[This]: TypeTag] 
```
is not allowed.

```
scala> trait LazyExp[+This <: LazyExp[This]: TypeTag]
<console>:1: error: traits cannot have type parameters with context bounds `: ..
.' nor view bounds `<% ...'
       trait LazyExp[+This <: LazyExp[This]: TypeTag]
                                                      ^
```

Probably the type parameter This is volatile because of type erasure.

Maybe macros?
