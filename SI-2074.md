Below is the transcript of the rather short interpreter session, running on MacOS X 10.5.7. I have not managed to reproduce this error from compiled code. Original attempt was to use reduceLeft on the zipped Ranges, which also fails in the same way in the interpreter, but not in compiled code.

Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18027-b20090614100907 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_07).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.

I don't have time to figure this out today, but it turns out it's not a repl thing.  Here is code you can compile to induce it.
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.Vector
import scala.collection.generic.VectorView

object o {
  val v = new VectorView[Int, Vector[Int]] {
    def underlying = Vector(1,2,3)
    def apply(idx: Int) = underlying(idx)
    def length = underlying.length
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(go)
  }
  def go = v zip v
}
{code}

I am guessing the failing cast is this line in SequenceViewTemplate's zip implementation:
{code}
    if (b.isInstanceOf[NoBuilder[_]]) newZipped(that).asInstanceOf[That]
{code}
I think it is inferring that "That" is a "SequenceViewTemplate?$$$$anon$$10" instead of a VectorView? The collections still hold many mysteries for me.
For the matter of that all VectorViews die on zip, so a much simpler reproduction is:
{code}
scala> val x = scala.collection.Vector(1,2,3).view
x: java.lang.Object with scala.collection.generic.VectorView[Int,Vector[Int]] = MutableVectorTemplate(1, 2, 3)

scala> x zip x
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.generic.SequenceViewTemplate$$$$anon$$10
{code}
I suppose this is really about the not quite working view code making its way out into the world through Range's inherent viewness.  Looking around the other view classes I see there is more trouble.
{code}
scala> List.range(1,11).view.patch(5, List(100,101), 2)
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at scala.collection.generic.SequenceViewTemplate$$Patched$$class.$$init$$(SequenceViewTemplate.scala:115)
	at scala.collection.generic.SequenceViewTemplate$$$$anon$$9.<init>(SequenceViewTemplate.scala:144)
{code}
Oh look, that's an initialization order fail! How timely.
{code}
    protected[this] val from: Int
    protected[this] val patch: Sequence[B]
    protected[this] val replaced: Int
    private val plen = patch.length   // uh-oh mr. plen, meet mr. abstract null
{code}
