Since r23222 this is a compiler error:
```scala
test.scala:3: error: super constructor cannot be passed a self reference unless parameter is declared by-name
object ChildType extends ParentType(ChildType.something) {
                 ^
one error found
```

Paul can you comment if this is intended for this ticket as well (and close the bug) or reassign to the meeting, please?
