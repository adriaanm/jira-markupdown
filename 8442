Duplicate of SI-6277.

Good news is that we have a pull request that fixes the underlying problem of both SI-6277 and this bug, and that I'm doing my best to push it into RC1. 

Bad news is that I've removed Symbol.hasAnnotation (though Symbol.annotations is still there). For 2.10.0 we strive for the simplest API possible. In subsequent point releases we plan to expand the API with more convenience methods.
