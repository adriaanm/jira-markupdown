But the whole problem is the warnings which there is no way to eliminate.  It was perhaps a mistake to reopen this ticket, because the original submitter wants to suppress unchecked warnings  in a possibly irresponsible way.  I want to suppress the ones which either cannot be suppressed at all, or which are the best way to do something.  I want to SUPPRESS warnings because I want to HEAR MORE warnings.  "There were 51 unchecked warnings" is not hearing.

Here's the sanity test of everyone's position: why isn't -unchecked on by default? It sure as hell should be.  There is no more frequently answered question than "why doesn't this match work", and the transcript almost always shows that nice ignorable "there were unchecked warnings." But to do that we have to make it easy for people to suppress them, because there is still no other way in some cases, and certainly there's no comparably aesthetic way in others.

To be burying all of the unchecked warnings because we don't want people to bury some of them is the epitome of "we had to destroy the village in order to save it."
