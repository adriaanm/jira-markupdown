{{ 
's = 2
{code}

gives

{code}
error: value update is not a member of object Symbol
{code}

Which is misleading since an update method wouldn't do any better. For other assignments to vals I tried, including 

{code}
val s = 's
s = 2
{code}

I either got

{code}
error: reassignment to val
{code}

or for assignments to other literals

{code}
error: illegal start of definition
{code}
It's because 's is defined to be a shorthand for Symbol("s"), so
's = 2 is Symbol("s") = 2, which is the same as Symbol.update("s", 2).
