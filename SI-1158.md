```scala
's = 2
```

gives

```scala
error: value update is not a member of object Symbol
```

Which is misleading since an update method wouldn't do any better. For other assignments to vals I tried, including 

```scala
val s = 's
s = 2
```

I either got

```scala
error: reassignment to val
```

or for assignments to other literals

```scala
error: illegal start of definition
```
It's because 's is defined to be a shorthand for Symbol("s"), so
's = 2 is Symbol("s") = 2, which is the same as Symbol.update("s", 2).
