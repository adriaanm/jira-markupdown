Thank you so much. Google was giving scala-lang.org/api/2.5.0/scala/collection/immutable/Queue.html as a second result for "scala queue immutable". I wasn't so careful and I did not notice that it was for version 2.5. I overestimated the power of google search engine :) â€“ Alexis Clarembeau 19 hours ago
