My partest refactor from last summer (which collided with the other partest refactor) used javax.tools to run javac and collect errors, and does fail the example.

I dimly recall that other useful messages include: are all my compile groups free of deprecations, or whatever.  I had ambitions for using all the outputs.

This code had a small performance boost, but not a killer feature. I guess this would be a minor feature.
