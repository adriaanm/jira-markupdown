You yourself did write it.  You wrote () match { case () => .  There is no reason in the world to warn on () == () but not on that, or vice versa.  They are the same thing. (You deserved the unreachable warning-should-be-error as well.)

If you are saying the error message should be tailored to the original syntax, then I would say absolutely it should. But it sounds like you're saying not to warn at all, and the logic of that escapes me.
