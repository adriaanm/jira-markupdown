If the intended behavior is to rename the _file_, then this is not a bug.  If the intended behavior is to rename uses of the _class', then this is a bug.  However, even if the latter is the correct interpretation it sounds like Eclipse is providing the wrong user interface, because it does not sound like there is a way to rename a class {{Foo}} that appears in a file {{Bar}}.
