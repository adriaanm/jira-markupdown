Correctly errors out in 2.9, compiles without warning in 2.10.
{code}
object Test {
  sealed trait Foo
  object Bar extends Foo

  def f(x: Foo) = x match {
    case scala.Right => true
    case _           => false
  }
}
// scala 2.9
// ./a.scala:9: error: pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
//  found   : object Right
//  required: Test.Foo
//     case scala.Right => true
//                ^
// one error found
{code}
The change wasn't in the typechecker, it was in the library. Matching against `scala.util.Right` still gives the error.

{code}
object Test {
  sealed trait Foo
  object Bar extends Foo

  object Other
  val OtherAlias = Other

  def f(x: Foo) = x match {
    case Other => true // warns
    case _     => false
  }

  def g(x: Foo) = x match {
    case OtherAlias => true // no warning.
    case _          => false
  }
}

{code}

The check happens in {{adapt}}, which calls {{inferModulePattern}} if the pattern's symbol is a module. Seems to me that we should make the check for any stable identifier pattern:

{quote}
A stable identifier pattern is a stable identifier r (ยง3.1). The type of r must conform to the expected type of the pattern. The pattern matches any value v such that r == v (ยง12.1).
