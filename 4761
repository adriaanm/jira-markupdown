(In r24312) Moved unlift to the Function companion object, which might have been
better in the first place.  Had to make a minor change to genprod,
and then I couldn't escape that unscathed.  Finished the not very
complete undertaking I found there to update the scaladoc.  Lots of
little changes to the generated text and code.

I changed genprod to only put a unique stamp on Function0 so we can
stop having a 100 file diff everytime an i is dotted somewhere.

Closes SI-3825, no review.
