It seems that guarded match expressions are not tested for completeness at compile time. Or, more accurately, it seems that guarded case statements are optimistically considered complete. For example, the following code will compile without "warning: match is not exhaustive!", even though calling it with a value of 1 will result in a MatchError.

```
def foo(x: Option[Int]): Int = x match {
  case Some(n) if n % 2 == 0 => n
  case None => 0
}
```

The equivalent code in Ocaml does print a non-exhaustive match warning at compile time. 

```
let foo(x) = 
  match x with
  | Some n when n mod 2 = 0 -> n
  | None -> 0;;


Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
Some _
(However, some guarded clause may match this value.)
val foo : int option -> int = <fun>
```

Obviously the compiler can't decide whether or not arbitrary combinations of guards are complete, but I was surprised didn't treat guards pessimistically like Ocaml does. This actually bit us in production code, when a method like this:

```
def foo(x: Option[Int]): Int = x match {
  case Some(n) if n % 2 == 0 => n
  case _ => 0
}
```

was refactored to look like this:

```
def foo(x: Option[Int]): Int = x match {
  case Some(n) if n % 2 == 0 => n
  case None => 0
}
```

which resulted in runtime MatchErrors.

I understand that adding a warning that treats guarded match statements pessimistically could be annoying in cases when the combined guards actually are safe, but in these instances the warning could easily be dismissed with an annotation or a noop unguarded match. Why don't we give Scala users the option for added safety?
> In general, we can't statically decide whether a guard is true or false ...  you're right that there are simple cases where we could, 

I agree that scalac can't determine the result of all "if" guards at compile time, but I don't think the right fix is to try to do that in simple cases.

I think that scalac should treat all "if" guards as possibly-false at compile time, and adjust the exhaustiveness checks accordingly.

So code like:
```scala
x match {
  case Some(n) if n % 2 == 0 => "even"
  case None => "nothing"
}
```
would give an exhaustiveness warning, and users would know that they need to do either:
```scala
x match {
  case Some(n) if n % 2 == 0 => "even"
  case Some(n) => "odd"
  case None => "nothing"
}
```
or
```scala
x match {
  case Some(n) if n % 2 == 0 => "even"
  case _ => "not even"
}
```
to fix the warning.

> our key design goal is not to have spurious warnings

Are you saying that treating "if" guards as possibly-false would lead to spurious warnings? I don't think that the warning in the example above would be suprious, I think it would be correct and very helpful.
I don't think that example stands up to scrutiny. If  `g1 || g2` really is constant true, then rewrite your proposed:
```scala
x match {
  case p if g1 => ...
  case p if g2 => ...
}
```
to just:
```scala
x match {
  case p if g1 => ...
  case p => ...
}
```
This will a) allow the compiler to verify exhaustiveness and b) will help the reader to understand the code.
> Fair enough, how about `g1 || g2 || g3`? People write the darnedest code!

Are you asking about the case with code like
```scala
x match {
  case p if g1 => ...
  case p if g2 => ...
  case p if g3 => ...
}
```
... and where the compiler cannot establish that "{{g1 || g2 || g3 === true}}"?

Exactly the same principle applies. The compiler ought to complain that the match may not be exhaustive, and give an error like:
```scala
  warning: match may not be exhaustive.
  It would fail on the following input: p 
  (Note that 'if' guard clauses assumed to be false for the purposes of exhaustiveness checks.)
```

Then the user will realise that it is unhelpful to both the compiler and to the readers of their code to expect them to infer that "{{g1 || g2 || g3 === true}}", and they should rewrite the code as follows:

```scala
x match {
  case p if g1 => ...
  case p if g2 => ...
  case p => ...
}
```

This is much easier to read; it is much easier for the compiler to verify, and (assuming that the identity is in fact true, and that the tests have no side-effects), it is completely equivalent.

Therefore I think that:
 1. the compiler should not give up on  exhaustivity checks when encountering guard checks, as it will omit useful warnings (as can be seen in the initial bug report at the top)
 2. the compiler should assume that all guards are "false" when performing exhaustivity checks, as it is simple, predictable and correct (in general)
(This has parallels with "definite assignment analysis".
In the "{{g1 || g2 || g3 === true}}" case, we wouldn't expect the compiler to be happy with Java code like:

```scala
int i;
if (g1) {
 i = 1
} else if (g2) {
 i = 2
} else if (g3) {
 i = 3
}
println(i)
```

It is not considered a burden on developers that they need to "help" the compiler (and readers of their code) by changing the last block to an "else", like:

```scala
int i;
if (g1) {
 i = 1
} else if (g2) {
 i = 2
} else {
 i = 3
}
println(i)
```

I think this is how people expect the compiler to behave in this case.)
Scala used to issue exhaustiveness warnings in the face of guards. It seems to have disappeared as of 2.10.x: https://gist.github.com/overthink/e56f35159f6bc5751d34  I had stupidly been relying on these warnings... and just got burned.

I would value a compiler flag that will cause a warning when exhaustiveness checks are disabled.
I agree as well.

There are cases today when you get a spurious warning: if you know more than the compiler about the possible values that can reach the match. That's why we already have the `@unchecked` annotation.

I don't see an example (yet?) where the change proposed here would lead to new spurious warnings.
- As discussed, if  `||(conditions)` is always true, it is good practice to leave the last out.
- If there's a single pattern with a guard then you know more than the compiler. But then why even put the condition in the first place? Just leave it away.
- If there are multiple conditions, but their `||` might be false, again you know more than the compiler. Same thing: just leave away the last condition.

One argument might be that an incomplete match is like an assertion (in the shape of a `MatchError`). But firstly, this is bad style (better make it explicit, so others can see it), and secondly, doing the same thing with just patterns (no guards) **does** give an exhaustiveness warning. So it would be fine to also issue it in the case of guards.
