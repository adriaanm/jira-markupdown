This is Scala 2.8.0.final or equally a more recent snapshot like scala-2.8.0.r22830-b20100824020153.

The following example makes the Redblack implementation behind SortedSet/SortedMap crash:
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.SortedSet

abstract class OP
case class A(i: Int) extends OP
case class D(i: Int) extends OP
case class R(i: Int, j: Int) extends OP

val ops = List(A(6), A(10), A(12), A(14), A(16), A(17), A(19), A(21), A(22), A(24), A(29), D(10), A(10), D(10), A(10), D(12), A(12), D(12), A(12), R(16,30), D(17), D(19))

(SortedSet.empty[Int] /: ops) { case (s, A(i)) => s + i case (s, D(i)) => s - i case (s, R(i, j)) => s.range(i, j) }
{code}

Maybe some mistake from some literature has been copied here.  Something like this has happened to other libraries before.

It might help to look at the following proven implementation
http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/Library/RBT_Impl.html
I have looked at it, and this is not related to SI-2849, except to the extent that the patch I submitted had a few sanity checks, which were triggered here.

The problem is solely with the naive implementation of {{range}}. Before calling that method, the tree is balanced:

{code}
scala> res49
res54: scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack[Int]#BlackTree[Int] = BlackTree(17,(),BlackTree(14,(),BlackTree(10,(),RedTree(6,(),Empty,Empty),RedTree(12,(),Empty,Empty)),BlackTree(16,(),Empty,Empty)),BlackTree(21,(),BlackTree(19,(),Empty,Empty),RedTree(24,(),BlackTree(22,(),Empty,Empty),BlackTree(29,(),Empty,Empty))))

scala> res49.left
res57: scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack[Int]#Tree[Int] = BlackTree(14,(),BlackTree(10,(),RedTree(6,(),Empty,Empty),RedTree(12,(),Empty,Empty)),BlackTree(16,(),Empty,Empty))

scala> res49.right
res58: scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack[Int]#Tree[Int] = BlackTree(21,(),BlackTree(19,(),Empty,Empty),RedTree(24,(),BlackTree(22,(),Empty,Empty),BlackTree(29,(),Empty,Empty)))
{code}

Now, when {{range(Some(16), Some(30))}} is called on it, all the conditions at the start are false, so the code path beginning with {{val newLeft = left.range(from, None)}} is taken:

{code}
176	   override def range(from: Option[A], until: Option[A]): Tree[B] = {
177	      if (from == None && until == None) return this
178	      if (from != None && isSmaller(key, from.get)) return right.range(from, until);
179	      if (until != None && (isSmaller(until.get,key) || !isSmaller(key,until.get)))
180	        return left.range(from, until);
181	      val newLeft = left.range(from, None)
182	      val newRight = right.range(None, until)
183	      if ((newLeft eq left) && (newRight eq right)) this
184	      else if (newLeft eq Empty) newRight.upd(key, value);
185	      else if (newRight eq Empty) newLeft.upd(key, value);
186	      else mkTree(isBlack, key, value, newLeft, newRight)
187	    }
{code}

None of the conditions following it are true either, so {{mkTree}} is called, which simply creates a new tree with the branches as indicated. However, the branches returned by {{newLeft}} and {{newRight}} are not balanced:

{code}
scala> res49.left.range(Some(16), None)
res55: scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack[Int]#Tree[Int] = BlackTree(16,(),Empty,Empty)

scala> res49.right.range(None, Some(30))
res56: scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack[Int]#Tree[Int] = BlackTree(21,(),BlackTree(19,(),Empty,Empty),RedTree(24,(),BlackTree(22,(),Empty,Empty),BlackTree(29,(),Empty,Empty)))
{code}

In fact, such a thing could happen for trees of any depth, which makes me doubtful such a join can be easily and efficiently done. The {{append}} on {{del}} depends on both subtrees having the same depth. However, I haven't researched it beyond identifying the bug.


By the way, the proven implementation given doesn't contain an implementation of {{range}} either.
The discussion of {{range}} above touches general library design issues.  I was first looking for a way to get the next entry after a given one, or enumerate an interval between two entries.  I was then surprised to see the full {{range}} operation that does the job together with {{toStream}}.  Later I became more ambitious and started using {{range}} more agressively to tune my application, which is here BTW: http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/file/a4a465dc89d9/src/Pure/PIDE/markup_tree.scala#l59

From a user's point of view, I would say plain enumeration of ranges would be fine as a start ...

You can get an {{iterator}} for the {{SerotedSet}}, on which you can apply {{dropWhile}} and {{takeWhile}}, which would result in the same effect. For instance:

{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.SortedSet

def SortedSetRangeIterator[A](set: SortedSet[A], from: A, until: A)(implicit ord: Ordering[A]) = {
  import ord._
  set.iterator.dropWhile(_ < from).takeWhile(_ < until)
}
{code}

Testing this I noticed that {{TreeSet}}'s {{range}} is broken. All {{range}} methods in Scala take an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound, which is not happening here.

I wonder if I should open a new ticket, or leave this to be fixed here, which we'll have to touch {{range}} extensively anyway.

Err, I wanted to exploit the tree structure, navigating quickly to the starting point and then continuing from there in a linear fashion.  The {{dropWhile}} above incurs a linear penalty in the start, right?

Yes, I did stumble across this unexpected behaviour, too.  Although I thought it was intentional.  Exclusive end range is better of course, and it will save me one special case in chopping off my tree.
I have produced a patch for this, taking advantage of some methods used for {{del}}, which have now been moved outside that method, and an algorithm I devised for appending trees of arbitrary depth differences. I've tested this with a scalacheck suite of tests, also attached.

Since I have worked on this patch on a cloned github repo, I have also made a pull request there for the patch, in the change that that's easier.

I have [http://github.com/dcsobral/scala/commit/3fd85f6f52e5f5685ce22cb5cbbfd5d406a107f4 committed] a simple fix on github that relies on {{dropWhile}}, {{takeWhile}}, {{foldLeft}} and {{update}} to produce a new range.

The performance shouldn't be particularly bad, though it does create a whole new tree instead of taking advantage of existing elements of the existing tree. Still, this ought to be better than the broken implementation presently available.

It is still my intention to pursue a superior fix, but I lost the window to 2.8.1 already, so I'd prefer to have this fix in.

It is buggy. The first "forall" needs to be an "exists", I think. I have always hated figuring forall/exists logic for empty collections... I'm working on fixing the test suit to detect this problem before I work on fixing it (which ought to be trivial, but my record with this ticket has been lousy).

I warned you you should have waited for my new test suite. As it happens, there was still one bug left. I made a pull request on the fix here: http://github.com/dcsobral/scala/pull/1


Curiously enough, once I had a proper test suite in place, doing the actual work was pretty quick. I reused most of the stuff from the previous broken patch, with just a few minor modifications.

Patch is here: http://github.com/dcsobral/scala/commit/e87ed79e78378b864eacbc498554f224de177ccc

However, even though it passed all tests from my test suite (and it *didn't* pass some when I had something wrong -- which gives me some confidence on the test suite itself :), it is rather big and a bit complex. Commit with care.

(In r23551) Applying patch by Daniel Sobral for SI-3796. Closes SI-3796.

No review.
