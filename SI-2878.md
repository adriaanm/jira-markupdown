Steps to reproduce the bug:

 1. Create a Scala project named _test_
 2. Create a Scala class named _Test_
 3. Delete the project selecting the "Delete project contents on disk" checkbox.

As a result of step 3 the project named *test* gets successfully deleted from Eclipse and the project's files get deleted from the filesystem.

 4. Create a new project with the same name (_test_)

After step 4 a new project named *test* gets successfully created but in the Package Explorer view it contains the *Test.scala* file from the first project. The file does not exist on disk and when we double-click on it the editor reports an error message that says: "File /test/src/Test.scala does not exist".

This bug is non deterministic (I could not reproduce it 100% of the time), also this is an old bug and not a result of the recent work for #2680.

Tested with Eclipse 3.5.1 and SDT r20423.
*On the nondeterminism*

If I am correct the bug can be reproduced only one time per Eclipse session even if you use different names every time you execute the above test case. For example you execute the above steps with project name *test1* and then when you try again with the name *test1* or *test2* the bug does not get reproduced. To observe the erroneous behavior again you have to restart Eclipse.
