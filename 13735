The equals method of case classes uses "instanceof" and is therefor not symmetric. This means that a.equals(b) doesn't imply b.equals(a), such as in this example:

scala> case class A{}
defined class A

scala> case class B extends A{}
defined class B

scala> val a = A()
a: A = A()

scala> val b = B()
b: B = B()

scala> a == b
res0: Boolean = true

scala> b == a
res1: Boolean = false
