I'm doing heavy refactoring on a medium sized project (44 source files, 3800 LOC).  The project doesn't build, there are a lot of outstanding compilation problems.

Nonetheless, here's the issue:

1) I start Eclipse and select my project's workspace
    => Errors are shown in the Problems view (this is expected)

2) Do Project -> Clean -> Clean All Projects
    => Get 50 items in the Problem View (this is expected)

3) Edit one file, insert and delete a white space, save.
    => Now I get 78 items in the Problems View
       Many of them having to do with "not found: type XXX"

So the issue is that somehow editing any file leads to an inconsistent state when some types that are known are no longer found.

I'm attaching my Eclipse logs.
