scalac reports error in the following code;
{code:scala}
object Obj {
  val s1 = <a/><b/>
  println("hi")
}

value println is not a member of scala.xml.NodeBuffer possible cause: maybe a semicolon is missing before `value println'?
{code}


When {{<a/></b>}} is either replaced with {{<a/>}} alone or enclosed in parentheses or curly braces, code is compiled without error. Entering the semicolon as suggested also allows compilation to proceed.
