Enter the following sequence in the REPL:

import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
val f = Future { 4 / 0 }
for (exc <- f.failed) println(exc)
val f = Future { 4 / 2 }
val f = Future { 4 / 0 }
for (exc <- f.failed) println(exc)
val f = Future { 4 / 0 }

The last line will evaluate as:

scala> val f = Future { 4 / 0 }
f: scala.concurrent.Future[Int] = List()

which is not possible as an empty list is not a Future.
