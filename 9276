It's a bit off topic, but what's the reason that "redundant outer pointers" aren't removed by, say, the optimizer? Does "separate compilation" stand in the way?

At least for "late closure classes", the new optimizer does a thorough job of squashing unneeded outer pointers,

I thought that Constructors would detect (most) cases of redundant outer pointers, isn't that enough?
