Almost everything that inherits from `LinearSeqLike` also inherits from `LinearSeqOptimized`.  As a practical matter, there are no extant use cases where it is really wise to make the distinction between the two.  Since linearity doesn't add any new methods (it's just for optimization), the distinction between the two should be removed.
