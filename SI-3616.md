```scala
object X extends Enumeration {
    val Y = Value
}
object Fruit extends Enumeration {
    val x = X.Y
    val A,B,C = Value
}
```


```scala

scala> Fruit.values
res0: Fruit.ValueSet = object$$Fruit.ValueSet(x, B, C)
```

The original version was 2.8.0.RC5 but I can reproduce it with 2.8.0.RC6.

```scala

(In r22446) Enumeration fixes.  There was no way to do reflection-based naming
correctly simply by inspecting method signatures (because a Value from
a different Enumeration stored in a val looks identical to one from
this Enumeration) so I have Value store the outer Enum for comparison
purposes.  This won't make anything new uncollectable because they
already have an $$outer pointing there.  This also simplified the
reflection logic: it's an eq test rather than a series of heuristics.

Closes #3616, #3615.  Review by phaller.
The inspection seems to be broken still in 2.8.1.RC1. it works if I define the name for Value but breaks if the name is not defined.

That one seems to be a duplicate of #3687 (see comments of that ticket). It might be actually that this is the other way around, but it would be nice to keep things in one place. Assigning to myself as I was appointed to fix enumeration bugs.
(In r23893) Closes #3687, #3719, #3950, #3616. Plus removed some deprecated stuff for 2.9. Review by extempore
