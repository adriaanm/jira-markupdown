You won't have looked at the neg test class where ElysianField becomes ElysianFailed.

I'll try to figure out how the elidable deltas broke the build.  I can attest that git pull and ant test worked on my machine, but there may be interactions with later commits. I'll have to learn how to use git to fetch the commits.
