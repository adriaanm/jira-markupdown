When using **scala** to run a script, if there are any compilation errors, it should exit with a non-zero exit value. (Currently, it exits with 0 in all cases)

This is a convention strictly adhered by most interpreters/shells and makes it easy to chain commands, for example,
```scala
scala myScript || echo "myScript was unsuccessful"
```
