By the line number table, bytecode instruction 39 is said to be located at line 15, which is just false. If you are stepping through the debugger, it seems like "g" is being called even though it is not, because it happens to be at line 15. Bytecode instruction 39 should be at the end of the method (not on an instruction that isn't executed!). 

The second example is related: set a break point at throw new Error, and it will stop there even if b is true! Return has to be fixed. I can trust the debugger anymore.


Sean, this is not something that can be fixed easily. For your first example, the position in the trees are such that there is no way to know at which line 'return' should be. One gets a position for the _beginning_ of a tree, i.e. the {{Block}} representing the rhs of method {{main}}, but not where it ends. So the compiler has to approximate, and use either the position of the enclosing block (not good, it would mean to jump to the beginning of the method) or the latest position that it has seen. In this case, it is the 'g'. I'll have to find a better way of handling these situations.
