import scala.reflect.macros.Context

object Macros {
  def impl[T: c.WeakTypeTag](c: Context) = {
    import c.universe._
    val sym = weakTypeOf[T].typeSymbol.asClass
    val left = sym.knownDirectSubclasses.toList.find(_.name.toString == "Left").get.asClass
    println(left.isCaseClass)
    c.literalUnit

This code incorrectly prints false. If one inserts a call to "left.typeSignature" before the print, the code will correctly print true.
Fixing this would be a challenge of a magnitude similar to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7046, because both of these issues are about lazy completers. In this particular case we're a bit more lucky, since we could auto-force symbols returned by knownDirectSubclasses, but that might lead to spurious cyclic reference errors, but I would prefer not to do that inside the reflection framework.
