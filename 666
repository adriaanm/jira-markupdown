Doesn't work with primitive arrays.
```scala
scala> Array("a").isInstanceOf[Array[_]]
warning: there were unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
res8: Boolean = true

scala> Array(1).isInstanceOf[Array[_]]  
warning: there were unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
res9: Boolean = false
```
