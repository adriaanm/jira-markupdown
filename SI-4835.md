In the following program using Stream#iterator, OutOfMemoryError should not occur
Because no references to Stream's head are not hold and Stream was converted to Iterator
using Stream[+A]#iterator.

object StreamIteratorProblem {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val infiniteIterator = Stream.from(1).iterator
    for(i <- 1 to 10000000) {
      val e = infiniteIterator.next
      if(e % 1000000 == 0) println(e)
    }
  }
}

However, When this program runs, OutOfMemoryError occurs as the following:

>scala StreamIteratorProblem
1000000
2000000
3000000
4000000
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

I found that there exists the reason of this problem in `StreamIterator` in "Stream.scala`.  
In the definition of StreamIterator as the followings,

class StreamIterator[+A](self: Stream[A]) extends Iterator[A] {
  // A call-by-need cell.
  class LazyCell(st: => Stream[A]) {
    lazy val v = st
  }
}

an argument `self` of primary constructor continues to hold the reference to a Stream.  
Then, whenever StreamIterator#next is called, memory consumption increases.

I created a patch to this problem and will attach it.  It seems works well.
This patch breaks the lazyness of stream for the initial element. I think that isn't a big problem, though effects of that can be subtle. Assigning null to self shouldn't be necessary -- if you don't use it in a method, it shouldn't become part of the object.

I'm surprised, however, that "val stream" inside the definition of "var these" doesn't suffer from the same problem -- even though it is in a small scope, it ought to be saved so that it is preserved when the by-name LazyCell gets invoked. It might even be a bug here.
Hello.  Thanks for commenting to my patch.  However, I couldn't understand that my patch breaks the lazyness of stream for the initial element.  If you don't mind, I would like to see concrete example of it.

I think that it isn't big problem, too.  However, I think that Iterator#next is **not** to expected consume O(n) memory generally.

> Assigning null to self shouldn't be necessary â€“ if you don't use it in a method, it shouldn't become part of the object.

Because primary constructor's arguments `self` continues to exist until ths object is garbage collected, assigning null to self is needed now if StreamIterator's API shouldn't be changed.

Thanks again.
