I've attached a source program which demonstrates this. 
(Ignore the fact that the granularity is way off, 
creating 256 Futures per iteration. This is simplified
code for this defect; the real code splits up the tasks
based on the number of processors, etc.)

The FuturesDeadlock object in the attached code repeats a matrix operation 50 times. Each matrix operation creates many futures, then uses Futures.awaitAll(5000, futures) to wait for each to complete. On my Windows PC with 2 cores, each iteration takes about 400 to 800ms. Early iterations run successfully. However, after the program has been running for more than 5000ms, the Futures.awaitAll starts returning None, indicating one of more Futures timed out. However, the iteration itself has
not lasted 5000ms. 

Here is the execution output.
{code}
     Iteration  1 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 736.55ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 889.88ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 499.62ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 510.56ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 481.60ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 506.61ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 497.60ms 
     Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 succeeded in 486.03ms 
>>>> Iteration 50 of 256X256 max 256X256 failed after 380.79ms <<<<< 
{code}

I infer that Futures is reusing earlier created Actors and the Timers scheduled in the first iteration are expiring
during later iterations, timing out Futures that
should not be timed out.

Thus, these timers must be canceled when a Future's actor completes normally so they do not send a TIMEOUT.

Using much longer timeouts (i.e. 10 years: 10*365*24*60*60*1000) will work to prevent these overlapping timeout, but this basically makes stort-term timeout values unusable.



I forgot to mention that this occurs in 2.7.6-final and 2.7.7RC2
