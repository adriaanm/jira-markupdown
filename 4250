Replying to [comment:1 rytz]:


Did you looked at the output in Netbeans? 

REPL was just my second go, and I did not
know, that there is such a restriction (thanks for that!).


in Scala 2.7 the output is:

{code}

first
second
second
first

{code}

as expected. Why you changed that from 2.7 to 2.8?

foo(1) does not call the second foo in Scala 2.8!
