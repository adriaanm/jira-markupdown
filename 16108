Take the class
{code}
public class Fisk {
    public static class A {
    }
    public static A A = new A();
}
{code} 

When calling it from Scala:
{code}
    val fisk = new Fisk.A()
    val strupp: Fisk.A = Fisk.A
{code}

The compiler fails compiling it:
{code}
error: A is already defined as object A
public static A A = new A();
{code}
