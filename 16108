Take the class
```scala
public class Fisk {
    public static class A {
    }
    public static A A = new A();
}
```

When calling it from Scala:
```scala
    val fisk = new Fisk.A()
    val strupp: Fisk.A = Fisk.A
```

The compiler fails compiling it:
```scala
error: A is already defined as object A
public static A A = new A();
```
