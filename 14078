Currently, Scala supports suppressing unchecked warning only for single expression:
```scala
(x: @unchecked) match { ... }
```

However, some classes (test cases, for example) tend to have many places where unchecked warnings arise. There should be a way to disable unchecked warnings for the whole class, like this:
```scala
@unchecked
object MyTests { ... }
```

or disable unchecked warnings for the whole compiler run:
```scala
scalac -ignore-unchecked
```
```scala
<scalac unchecked="ignore" ... />
```
