Currently, Scala supports suppressing unchecked warning only for single expression:

{code}
(x: @unchecked) match { ... }
{code}

However, some classes (test cases, for example) tend to have many places where unchecked warnings arise. There should be a way to disable unchecked warnings for the whole class, like this:

{code}
@unchecked
object MyTests { ... }
{code}

or disable unchecked warnings for the whole compiler run:

{code}
scalac -ignore-unchecked
{code}

{code}
<scalac unchecked="ignore" ... />
{code}
