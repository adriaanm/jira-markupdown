Looks like it doesn't work for Product1. Here's an example that works:
```scala
class A extends Product2[Int, String] {
  def _1: Int = 1
  def _2: String = "1"
  def isEmpty: Boolean = false
  def get: A = this
  def canEqual(that: Any) = true
}
 
object A {
  def unapply(a: A) = a
}

(new A) match {case A(1, "1") => true; case _ => false}
```
