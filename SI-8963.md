Otherwise, the stacktrace of the code calling `Failure.get` is lost. Wrapping the Failure exception preserves both stacktraces.

This is important because if `Failure.get` is called this is likely to be a bug in the code that calls `Failure.get` (and not in the code that produced the original Failure).

For some usages of `Try` this may not be too big a problem because `Failure` creation and calling `Failure.get` may occur together so that it is easy enough to infer where the problem is. However, in many cases `Try` is used to transport a possibly erroneous result over "bigger distances" where original stacktrace and `Failure.get` aren't executed close to each other so that finding the cause can get hard.

One particularly irritating effect of the current implementation is that `Await.result(future)` directly relies on `Try.get` so that the exception being thrown by that call doesn't include the stacktrace of the `Await.result` call but just the mostly useless stacktrace of the failed Future execution (e.g. a "Future timed out" stack trace that doesn't include any user code).
I didn't mention that this is a breaking change because any code relying on `Try.get` throwing the original exception will break.

My reasoning why this change is still a net-improvement is that you can always match on an expression of type `Try[T]` to get out the original error message if you want to. Relying on try/catch to get failures out of a `Try` should be considered an anti-pattern anyways.

Calling `Try.get` itself is an anti-pattern, but again on the other hand recovering the stacktrace of the thread calling Try.get / Await.result is impossible if the call is buried inside any third-party library and then debugging is next to impossible.
Here's a (artificial but very similar to the actual) scenario: How would you debug this stacktrace from a log?

```scala
Caused by: akka.pattern.AskTimeoutException: Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://default/user/handler]] after [500 ms]
 	at akka.pattern.PromiseActorRef$$anonfun$1.apply$mcV$sp(AskSupport.scala:333)
 	at akka.actor.Scheduler$$anon$7.run(Scheduler.scala:117)
 	at scala.concurrent.Future$InternalCallbackExecutor$.unbatchedExecute(Future.scala:599)
 	at scala.concurrent.BatchingExecutor$class.execute(BatchingExecutor.scala:109)
 	at scala.concurrent.Future$InternalCallbackExecutor$.execute(Future.scala:597)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$TaskHolder.executeTask(Scheduler.scala:467)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$$anon$8.executeBucket$1(Scheduler.scala:419)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$$anon$8.nextTick(Scheduler.scala:423)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$$anon$8.run(Scheduler.scala:375)
 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
```

My code doesn't use the ask pattern and my code doesn't use Await (but of course, any third party code I depend on may, I don't know). It only happens on production where I cannot attach a debugger. 

If `Failure.get` would provide a proper stacktrace finding the problem may have been very simple. Or at least working around it, as it would show where the problem is raised in my own code.
I don't think we can break the invariant that:

```scala
def prop(t: Throwable): Boolean = try { Try(throw t).get } catch t1: Throwable => t1 eq t }
```

However we might consider using `Throwable#setStackTrace` to augment the stack trace. We'd need to find other frameworks/libraries that use that to understand if it is possible/advisable.
Why? Would you also suggest this invariant:

```scala
def prop(t: Throwable): Boolean = try { Try(throw t) match { case Success(t) => t }  } catch t1: Throwable => t1 eq t }
```
A precedent: `java.util.concurrent.Future.get` wraps an exception that occurred during running a Future into an `ExecutionException`. http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html#get()
First, I agree that using `setStackTrace` could be a solution (though a non-standard one AFAIK). Also, yes, checked exceptions are probably the main reasons for the wrapper exceptions. Still, that means that wrapper exceptions are not a new thing.

But stepping back a bit, maybe let's focus on the problem. My basic problem is that `Try.get` doesn't work consistently with `Option.get` or `Either.right.get` and that was what I expected (and I guess other people as well). I regard all of the `get` methods as a shortcut for an assertion and a cast:

```scala
val x: Option[Int]
x.get
// = 
// assert(x.isDefined, "programmer assumed that x.isDefined")
// x.asInstanceOf[Some].value
```

Here's now an example showing the inconsistency:

```scala
  def optionTest(x: Option[Int]): Unit = {
    x.get // oops, unguarded access, bug in this line

    // Exception points to the buggy line:

    // java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get
    //   at scala.None$.get(Option.scala:313)
    //   at scala.None$.get(Option.scala:311)
    //   at example.GetInconsistence$.optionTest(GetInconsistence.scala:6)
  }
  def eitherTest(x: Either[String, Int]): Unit = {
    x.right.get // oops, unguarded access, bug in this line

    // Exception points to the buggy line:

    // java.util.NoSuchElementException: Either.right.value on Left
    // 	at scala.util.Either$RightProjection.get(Either.scala:454)
    // 	at example.GetInconsistence$.eitherTest(GetInconsistence.scala:17)
  }
  def tryTest(x: Try[Int]): Unit = {
    x.get // oops, unguarded access, bug in this line

    // Exception doesn't include buggy line at all:

    // 	at example.Service$$anonfun$tryResult$1.apply(GetInconsistence.scala:9)
    //  at example.Service$$anonfun$tryResult$1.apply(GetInconsistence.scala:9)
    // 	at scala.util.Try$.apply(Try.scala:161)
    //  at example.Service$.tryResult(GetInconsistence.scala:9)
    // 	at example.GetInconsistence$$anonfun$3.apply$mcV$sp(GetInconsistence.scala:50)
  }
```

If we classify this inconsistency as a problem introducing a new method with new semantics won't solve the problem: users may still assume consistency and use the old method as before.

IMO the long-term solution could be:
 - {{Failure.get}} wraps the exception
 - there's a new method {{Try.getOrRethrow}} that mimics the current semantics for everyone who relies on it

I don't suggest wrapping the exception in any case, you can still pattern match on `Try` and get the original message out of the `Failure` object as before, I just suggest to change the semantics of `Failure.get` in the long term.

How to deal with the compatibility problems is another topic that needs to be solved but maybe we should agree on the problem first :)
