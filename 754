It appears this problem is related to that reported in ticket scala/bug#816.  By removing all trace of repeated/sequence arguments, but keeping the case classes, one extending the other, I get a similar "consistency problem" error:
```scala
object test {
    case class A(val a: String)
    case class B(val b: Int, override val a: String) extends A(a)

    A("") match {
        case B(b,a) => println("B")
        case A(a) => println("A")
    }
}
```
```scala
error: consistency problem in target generation ! I have args ListBuffer(temp22) and need to jump to a label with fmls List()
		case A(a) => println("A")
```
