Yep, `-Xlog-implicts` tells you about that one, too.
```
qscalac -Xlog-implicits sandbox/test1.scala
sandbox/test1.scala:10: <highPriority: error> is not a valid implicit value for Bippy because:
reference to highPriority is ambiguous;
it is imported twice in the same scope by
import C._
and import B._
    println( implicitly[Bippy] ) // Prints: A
                       ^
```

But one man's trash is another man's treasure when it comes to these diagnostics. I don't think they are in a state to turn on by default.
