@axel22 [points out that](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4798#discussion_r42174935) [{{OpenHashMap.remove()}} doesn't release the reference to an entry's key](https://github.com/performantdata/scala/blob/9c97a7fbf67a9710b87b48e1020bb3c00a1f07a2/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/OpenHashMap.scala#L166) when the entry is deleted.

This ticket is to null the `key` field in `remove()` (and thus set it every time in `put()`). This could also include nulling the `Entry` reference as well.
