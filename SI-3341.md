Hi,

the bug is in:
def sliding[B >: A](size: Int, step: Int): Iterator[Repr] in Trait Iterable

This function does not seem to work with size=1. With size>1 everything seems to be ok.

The following code with size=1 produces an emtpy iterator:
```scala
scala> val foo = Seq(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
foo: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

scala> foo.sliding(1,2)
res0: Iterator[Seq[Int]] = empty iterator
```

This seems to be wrong. AFAIK this should instead produce one List which holds multiple Lists with one element each.
It seems to work with a size>1

This code shows the correct result with size >1 This is also what I would expect with size = 1. 
```scala
scala> val foo = Seq(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
foo: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

scala> foo.sliding(2,3)
res1: Iterator[Seq[Int]] = non-empty iterator
```

Only had time for a quick glance at the GroupedIterator Source (which seems to be implementing this behind the scene) there is a test for size >= 1 and step >= 1. So size = 1 should be legal.

Hi,

I believe the error is in library/scala/collection/Iterator.scala line 826
```scala
(howMany > 0 && len > gap)
```
seems to miss the initial condition. According to the comment 
```scala
// if 0 elements are requested, or if the number of newly obtained
// elements is less than the gap between sequences, we are done.
```

is used to test if we are done. But if we take a very small size and a very big step len will never be greater than gap.

A diff showing what I believe to be a first workaround is attached. (I am explicitly testing for this run to be the initial)

In my test it worked well enough, although somebody who has been doing Scala for more than 3 weeks can probably code a more elegant solution. There may be an opportunity to just fiddle with gap and len that I am missing right now.
