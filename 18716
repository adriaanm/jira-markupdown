Let's say we want to create a bunch of definitions of vals v1...vN with values equal to N:
{code}
(1 to N).map { i => 
  val name = TermName(s"v$i")
  q"val $name = $i"
}
{code}
What I would like to write instead is:
{code}
(1 to N).map { i => q"val v$i = $i" }
{code}
Semantics of this is not clear though, especially considering non-name splices into names and requires some brainstorming.
