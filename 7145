That's a simple example of triggering the issue:

{code}
trait Parent {
  override def toString = "blubber"
}

trait Simple extends Parent {
  def test = toString
}
{code}

Scalac generates this bytecode:

{code}
public static java.lang.String test(Simple);
  Code:
   Stack=1, Locals=1, Args_size=1
   0:	aload_0
   1:	invokeinterface	#12,  1; //InterfaceMethod Simple.toString:()Ljava/lang/String;
   6:	areturn
{code}

where javac would normally generate an `invokevirtual Object.toString`. Using `invokeinterface` in those cases isn't supported by dalvik currently.

It seems that the [last fix|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/64107de6cba37f796bd7c6b86509cefba312f91d] for this issue didn't solve the problem if the method was overridden in a super-interface.
