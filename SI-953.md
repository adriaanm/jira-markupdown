object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }

Gives the following compile error:

{code}
scala> object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: Int
       object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
                                        ^
{code}
I appreciate that the single value "hello" is useless there.  The caret seems completely misplaced; I'd expect it to go at the start of the for or before the final brace.
And once again, with formatting.

{code}
scala> object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: Int
       object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
{code}
This is not actually the first time I've used a bug tracker, honest.  Once again, actually showing the offending caret.

{code}
scala> object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: Int
       object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
                                        ^
{code}

In 2.10.0.r25323-b20110719020429 it looks like this:

{code}
object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
                                   ^
{code}
I would have guessed the first brace.
{code}
       object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
                                                      ^

scala> object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: Int
       object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
                                   ^----------------------------^

scala> def foo: Seq[Int] = for (x <- 1 to 10) yield { "hello" }
