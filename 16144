It's common (esp in finance) to have to multiply and divide decimal amounts by powers of ten (converting from pounds to pence for example). It would be nice to write:

{{{
   val pence = pounds.movePointRight(2)
}}}

Currently this looks a bit messy:

{{{
   val pence = BigDecimal(pounds.underlying.movePointRight(2))
}}}
