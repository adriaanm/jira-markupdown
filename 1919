You are wasting everyone's time when you post a bug report which requires half a dozen other jars.  If you're unwilling to distill it to something self-contained you really shouldn't expect someone to do it for you.

The error message says:
{code}
overloaded method value execute with alternatives (org.apache.http.HttpHost,org.apache.http.HttpRequest)org.apache.http.HttpResponse <and>

cannot be applied to (org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet,org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicResponseHandler)
{code}
So I don't know which of those signatures you think should work, but I bet if you pass the arguments the signature says it requires, you'll get better results.
