Thanks for the small bug report. The bug seems specific to inferred type arguments of implicit views. It is also present in Scala 2.11.0-M6. I'll take a look at what's going on.

{code}
scala> Left(1)
res8: scala.util.Left[Int,Nothing] = Left(1)

scala> EitherOps(res8)
res9: EitherOps[Int,Nothing] = EitherOps@c60090d

scala> EitherOps(res8).disjunction
res10: \/[Int,Nothing] = -\/(1)

scala> res8.disjunction
res11: \/[Int,B] = -\/(1)
{code}
