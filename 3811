(In r21504) Correct oversight where neg tests didn't demand a checkfile.
More trying to get timeout/interrupted logic so we know when
things die but also don't impede interrupts.  Folded precondition
logic into test sequence logic, it's plenty general to cover it.
Closes SI-3282, review by phaller.
