= problem =

the companion object for collection.mutable.Queue does not provide an empty method.

= analysis =

basically all collections provide an empty method in their companion objects (List.empty[A], IndexedSeq.empty[A], Set.empty[A], collection.immutable.Queue.empty[A], etc.)

for the mutable Queue, you currently need to use collection.mutable.Queue[A]()

= enhancement recommendation =

add the missing empty method.

I was wondering almost the same today. Is there a general rule when collections get an "empty" class method vs. an "empty" instance method?

But in you special case, I can't reproduce your error in 2.9 trunk:

{code}
Queue.empty
res19: scala.collection.mutable.Queue[Nothing] = Queue()
{code}

At the moment it is quite inconsistent:

{code}
//Both exist for example here:
Map.empty[Int, Int]
Map(1 -> 41).empty

Set().empty
Set.empty

//But here only the class methods are existing:

List.empty        //OK
List(1,2,3).empty //Doesn't exist

Array.empty       //OK
Array("a").empty  //Doesn't exist
{code}
