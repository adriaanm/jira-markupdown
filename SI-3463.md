I try to do the performance test with this code

{code}
class ScalaColls(n: Int) {
	val a = Array.fill(n)(new Object)
	
	def f(x: AnyRef) = x ne null
		
	def withForEach = {
		var b = false
		a.foreach(f)
	}
	
	def withWhile = {
		var i = 0;
		var b = false;
		while(i < n) {
			b = f(a(i))
			i += 1
		}
	}
}
{code}

and I found that 'withForEach' method works 8-10 times slower than 'withWhile'. If we look inside IndexedSeqOptimied we see

{code}
  override /*IterableLike*/
  def foreach[U](f: A =>  U): Unit = {
    var i = 0
    val len = length
    while (i < len) { f(this(i)); i += 1 }
  }
{code}

It seems 'foreach' and 'while-loop solution' would have just the same performance but they don't. Probably it's caused by wrong compilation IndexedSeqOptimized for Arrays that's using some Array-wrapper in byte-code instead of plain java-array.

By the way 'withWhile' has just the same speed as similar method written in Java. It means Scala and Java byte-codes are just the same for them. They must be just the same for all Array's seq-like methods too. Ten times is a great performance hit that can force a programer to use while-loop solutions instead of functional ones.
And by the way. The same strange thing goes with Range object. Inside its 'foreach' method has written

{code}
    if (fullLength > 0) {
      val last = this.last
      var i = start
      while (i != last) {
        f(i)
        i += step
      }
      f(i)
    }
{code}

but it goes 8-10 slower than the same while-loop wrote outside. 
Can you please post full programs? what is the size of the array/range object, and what version of Scala are you using? For instance, this stupid mini-benchmark is about as fast in the two cases, on my machine (trunk version of Scala).

{code}
object ForLoop extends testing.Benchmark {
  final val MAX = 15000000
  def run {
    var sum = 0
    for (i <- 0 until MAX) 
      sum += i
    println(sum)
  }  
}

object WhileLoop extends testing.Benchmark {
  final val MAX = 15000000
  def run {
    var sum = 0
    var i = 0
    while (i < MAX) {
      sum += i
      i += 1
    }
    println(sum)
  }  
}
{code}

Results:

I use 2.8.0.RC2 under Eclipse and IDEA. And time measurer from my own library. 

Array size was 1 000 000 but I tried different ones. And I tried different amounts of runs (it was 1000 runs for 1 000 000 array size). The range size was the same and I try it with this code (just slightly modified one from Array test):

{code}
class ScalaColls(n: Int) {
	val a = Array.fill(n)(new Object)
	
	def withForEach = {
		var b = false
		1 until n foreach {
			x => b = !b
		}
	}
	
	def withWhile = {
		var i = 0;
		var b = false;
		while(i < n) {
			b = !b
			i += 1
		}
	}
}
{code}

In all cases measures were the same: foreach goes 8-10 times slower than while-loop. 
Time measurer code if you need it: 

{code}
package ru.ibrae.time;

import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * 19.02.2010
 * 
 * @author lex
 * 
 */
public class MeasureTime {

	public static final int DefaultIterationsNum = (int) 1.0E6;

	protected int defaultIterationsNum = DefaultIterationsNum;

	protected ArrayList<ProcessForMeasuring> processes = new ArrayList<ProcessForMeasuring>();

	public MeasureTime(int iterationsNum) {
		defaultIterationsNum = iterationsNum;
	}

	public MeasureTime() {
	}

	public static long measure( int iterationsNum, ProcessForMeasuring process ) {
		MeasureTime measureTime = new MeasureTime();
		measureTime.add( process );
		return measureTime.measure( iterationsNum )r0;
	}

	public static long measure( ProcessForMeasuring process ) {
		return measure( DefaultIterationsNum, process );
	}

	public static void print( int iterationsNum, ProcessForMeasuring process ) {
		MeasureTime measureTime = new MeasureTime();
		measureTime.add( process );
		measureTime.print( iterationsNum );
	}

	public static void print( ProcessForMeasuring process ) {
		print( DefaultIterationsNum, process );
	}

	public void add( ProcessForMeasuring process ) {
		processes.add( process );
	}

	public long[] measure() {
		return measure( defaultIterationsNum );
	}

	public long[] measure( int iterationsNum ) {
		int size = processes.size();
		long[] times1 = new long[ size ];
		long[] times2 = new long[ size ];
		for ( int i = 0; i < size; i++ ) {
			times1[i] = repeate( iterationsNum, i );
		}
		for ( int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i-- ) {
			times2[i] = repeate( iterationsNum, i );
		}
		for ( int i = 0; i < times1.length; i++ ) {
			times1[i] = Math.min( times1[i], times2[i] );
		}
		return times1;
	}

	public void print() {
		print( defaultIterationsNum );
	}

	public void print( int iterationsNum ) {
		long[] times = measure( iterationsNum );
		int c = 0;
		for ( long time : times ) {
			c++;
			System.out.println( "Process " + c + ": " + time + " ms. over " + iterationsNum
					+ " iterations." );
		}
	}

	private long repeate( int iterationsNum, int i ) {
		ProcessForMeasuring processForMeasuring = processes.get( i );
		processForMeasuring.setUp();
		System.gc();
		long begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
		for ( int c = 0; c < iterationsNum; c++ ) {
			processForMeasuring.proceed();
		}
		long time = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin;
		return time;
	}
}
{code}
It's my test code: 

{code}
		int size = 1000000;
		final Object[] objs = new Object[ size ];
		final List<Object> list = new ArrayList<Object>();

		final ScalaColls sc = new ScalaColls( size );

		for ( int i = 0; i < size; i++ ) {
			objs[i] = new Object();
			list.add( new Object() );
		}
		MeasureTime mt = new MeasureTime( 10 );
		mt.add( new ProcessForMeasuring() {
			@Override
			public void proceed() {
				boolean b;
				for ( Object obj : list ) {
					b = ( obj != null );
				}
			}
		} );
		mt.add( new ProcessForMeasuring() {
			@Override
			public void proceed() {
				boolean b;
				for ( Object obj : objs ) {
					b = ( obj != null );
				}
			}
		} );
		mt.add( new ProcessForMeasuring() {

			@Override
			public void proceed() {
				sc.withWhile();
			}
		} );
		mt.add( new ProcessForMeasuring() {

			@Override
			public void proceed() {
				sc.withForEach();
			}
		} );

		mt.print();
{code}

But I tried stupid one too. Something like

{code}
long begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
sc.withWhile();
long time = System.currentTimeMillis() - begin;
{code}

in different combinations and so on. Results were the same.

How compiler can do it? Does it analyze algorithm and find that n-times of not-operation on a var itself can be replaced by odd/even check of n?
