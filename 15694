When combining lazy vals with loops it is easy to get unexpected infinite loops because bitmap is defined outside of the loop instead of inside it.
See example:
```scala
object Test {
    
    def start {
        var d = 10
        while (d < 20) {
            lazy val b = d + 1
            d = b
            println("Inc : " + d)
        }
    }

    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        start
    }
}
```

The solution to scala/bug#3670 might fix the case here as well but I am creating the ticket so that I don't forget it.
