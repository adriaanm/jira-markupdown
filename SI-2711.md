if I move the t2705 directory to files/jvm:

Testing individual files

(In r19910) tests in pending for see #2705 -- note that partest does not work for jvm tests under pending, move to files and it works, see #2711
I think this worked back when you reported it, but you have to tell partest you're using a different src dir unless you're in files.  It works like this (if not before, then definitely now.)
```scala
test/partest --srcdir pending test/pending/jvm/t2705
```
I could have it infer the srcdir from the test arguments.
This works in r24408, therefore I am closing this ticket now. Note that you need to use `--srcpath` instead of `--srcdir`, so it works like this:
```scala
test/partest --srcpath pending test/pending/neg/dbldef.scala
```
or like this:
```scala
./partest --srcpath pending pending/neg/dbldef.scala
```
