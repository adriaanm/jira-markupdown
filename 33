I participated anyway.  Here's what that def f generates in scala now.
```scala
  public synchronized java.lang.String f();
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_SYNCHRONIZED
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=1, args_size=1
         0: ldc           #12                 // String str
         2: areturn       
```
