Compiling the following code with scala 2.11.7

{code:scala}
class Bippy(@transient str: String) {
  override def toString = str
}
{code}

elicits the following warning:

{noformat}
Bippy.scala:1: warning: no valid targets for annotation on value str - it is discarded unused. You may specify targets with meta-annotations, e.g. @(transient @param)
class Bippy(@transient str: String) {
             ^
one warning found
{noformat}

However, javap shows that the field is indeed marked transient, so the warning is inaccurate:
{noformat}
Compiled from "Bippy.scala"
public class Bippy {
  private final transient java.lang.String str;
  public java.lang.String toString();
  public Bippy(java.lang.String);
}
{noformat}

Attempting to eliminate the warning by adding {{@(transient @field)}} does no good. In fact, the compiler is only happy when I mark the field {{@(transient @param)}} which is not what I want. Why would I want the parameter to be marked transient? It is the field that matters. In fact, looking at the source, {{scala.transient}} is already annotated with {{@field}} so no extra meta-annotation should be needed.

The superfluous warning just needs to go away.
