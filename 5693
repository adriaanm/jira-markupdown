It doesn't exactly *rely* on such changes, it's just me being clumsy. I've got a version now which only adds two new private methods. Still it is rejected by the forward binary compatibility check. I'm fairly new to all this — is there a common way to add some internal code in a way that passes the compatibility check?

I appreciate you jumping on the problem right away! It's just that scala/bug#8518 was broken in 2.10 too, so even if you fix this tomorrow, I still have to figure it out for my change. Thanks!
