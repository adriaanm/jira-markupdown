== problem ==
Left pane as an example: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html

Especially on small/high-resolution displays it is annoying to aim at the text while there is a large unused area around it.

== analysis ==
"Package headers": Only the package name is clickable.
Classes/traits/objects list: Only the name/icon is clickable.

== enhancement recommendation ==
Package headers: The whole blue area right of the package name should be used as the link area (except hide/show, focus). Additionally a text like "focus this package" or "focus" should fade in in the free space of the blue area, because it is hard to understand the difference between hide/show and clicking on the name without trying it first.

List of the individual classes/traits/objects: The empty space right of the names should work as a link too.
I adjusted the patch a bit more, fine-tuned the css and refined font-selection. 

It prefers a font with better differences between I, l and O, 0 and use the same settings for all pages.

The font-family definition looks like this now:
{{"Ubuntu", "Droid Sans", "Trebuchet MS", "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans", "DejaVu Sans Condensed", sans-serif;}}

I attached a new patch.
