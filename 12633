The critical file is `SuperColliderSpec.scala`, and I had to fix a source incompatibility when adding Scala 2.12.1: Line 82 `import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global` had to be removed because in Scala 2.12.1 the implicit is ambiguous, while it is _not_ so under Scala 2.10 and 2.11. My guess is the compiler hangs due to implicit resolution.
