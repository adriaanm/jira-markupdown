Recursive definitions are allowed and are confusing enough to be discussed at length in the usual forums.

The book does not propose it as a helpful example at the citation.

Footnotes are at the [end of the section|http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/first-steps-in-scala.html].

The real problem lies in [the forward-referenced section|http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/builtin-control-structures.html#sec:variable-scope]. Is no one bothered by the semi-colons? Are we barbarians?

Civilized people use {{locally}} to disambiguate their braces.

Also, the explanation of scoping in the REPL, albeit merely a "conceptual visualization", i.e., a metaphor, is a bit imprecise.

I would expect the stack trace to be truncated:
{noformat}
scala> val mySet: Set[String] = mySet + "Item3"
java.lang.NullPointerException
  ... 33 elided
{noformat}
