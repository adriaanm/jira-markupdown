Outgrowth of SI-1492, but that ticket has already been closed twice and the most important case works great.  But as mentioned in its comments it would be useful and more consistent if this also worked:
{code}
for (implicit a <- ...) {
  ...
}
{code}
The problem I see is the interaction with many other things. The `a' might be a pattern -- should the implicit then apply to all its variables? Then, the translation of generators in for expressions is quite involved. We'd have to speicfy how implicits are taken into account. This exceeds the design work usually associated with a ticket fix.  I close the ticket but would welcome a SID that contains spec language to regulate all these things.

I have a more modest PR in progress which just emits the implicit vals.

I'll also try to address SI-9158 by tupling extraction results instead of reapplying patterns downstream of midstream assignments. I see the SIP proposal pushes them into the body, which came up when Kim Stebel asked about it.
Maybe this is the right place to raise another possible extension to the `implicit` modifier (which I couldn't find elsewhere - sorry if it is). Namely, given, e.g. 

{code}
trait MyStateMonad[F[_]] extends MonadState[F, Int]{
      import scalaz.syntax.monad._
      implicit val _ = this // necessary in order to use the syntactic sugar
      ...
}
{code}

it'd be nice to be able to write that just as follows:

{code}
trait MyStateMonad[F[_]] extends MonadState[F, Int]{ implicit this =>
      import scalaz.syntax.monad._
      ...
}
{code}
