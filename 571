`min` and `max` make sense only for `Ordered` elements. Currently there is no straight way to express this type constraint inside the trait. Have a look at how these methods are defined inside the object:
```scala
  def min[A <% Ordered[A]](seq: Iterable[A]): A 
```

It would make sense to move them, when (if ever) Scala gets type constraints a la C#. Or maybe someone finds a clever way to code this using implicits..
