Having multiple implicit conversions can lead to duplicate members in a template. This affects `scala.Array` which has its members duplicated 10 times.

Here's a minimized example:

```scala
$ cat A.scala 
package a

trait Foo[S] {
  def foo(t: S): Int = 123
}

trait Boo[T]

object Boo {
  implicit class BooCharIsFoo(boo: Boo[Char]) extends Foo[Char]
  implicit class BooLongIsFoo(boo: Boo[Long]) extends Foo[Long]
}
```

If you look at the result of running:
```scala
$ scaladoc -implicits A.scala
```

You see that the member `foo` in `trait Boo` is duplicated:
!double-def.png!

The reason is that it's added through the different conversions (`BooCharIsFoo` and `BooLongIsFoo`). 

Now, if the signatures are identical, we could fold the "Implicit Member" information:
```scala
This member can be added in several ways:
  * by the implicit conversion X if ...
  * by the implicit conversion Y if ...
```

Now, what if the signatures are different, as is the case here? I don't know what to do. Any suggestions?
Ideally, we should extrapolate that there's a method `foo(t: T): Int` added to trait `Boo` only if `S =:= Char` or `S =:= Long`. 
But we have no way to do so -- what if we had:

```scala
object Boo {
  implicit class BooCharIsFoo(boo: Boo[Char]) extends Foo[/* >>> */Nothing/* <<< */]
  implicit class BooLongIsFoo(boo: Boo[Long]) extends Foo[/* >>> */AnyRef /* <<< */]
}
```

As an alternative, we could show the signature of `foo` from trait `Foo`, but that wouldn't make sense, as it refers to type parameter `S`, which doesn't exist in trait `Boo`.

The only sane approach I can think of is to add a scaladoc annotation that instructs the inferencer to ignore the implicit conversion -- this way, we can hide very specific conversions.  WDYT?
So I was thinking of having a look at this. The last option seems to be fairly easy to implement. How would this look?


```scala
object Boo {
  /**
   * @hideImplicitConversion
   */
  implicit class BooCharIsFoo(boo: Boo[Char]) extends Foo[Char]
}
```

What I mean by this is: that we would want to hide each implicit conversion explicitly - not all of them right?
So for this:

```scala
package a

import scala.annotation.hideImplicitConversion

trait Foo[S] {
  def foo(t: S): Int = 123
}

trait Boo[T]

trait ShouldNotAppear

object Boo {
  @hideImplicitConversion implicit class BooCharIsFoo(boo: Boo[ShouldNotAppear]) extends Foo[ShouldNotAppear]
  implicit class BooLongIsFoo(boo: Boo[Long]) extends Foo[Long]
}
```

I figured I could do something like this in `ModelFactoryImplicitSupport.scala:545`:

```scala
def implicitShouldDocument(aSym: Symbol): Boolean = {
  //...
  && !aSym.owner.annotations.map(_.symbol.nameString).contains("hideImplicitConversion")
}
```

But unfortunately, the entities that have their owner set to the annotated implicit class - not one of them has the method `foo`. So I started looking at it from the perspective "what `owner` does the method `foo` have"? Turns out it has `Foo` as owner (surprise!).

So then I figured: maybe I can get the implicit class from the method `foo` by checking if its owner has any subclasses that have the `@hideImplicitConversion` annotation. But when I look at the `_.owner.knownDirectSubclasses` list of entities - I get an empty set for `Foo`. I looked around and found: #7046. I'm not sure this has anything to do with this. I just don't know how to get the subclasses from the `Foo` trait this way. Any ideas?

(PS: #4949 on github is ready to be merged)

PS2: I hope this approach enables us to mask stuff out in the Predef btw!
Thanks for the explanation! Good thinking about the binary compatibility thing, then let's go for annotating in the comments. I will add it to the model and get back to you once I feel like I know what I'm doing.

Just to take what you said and put it in an example:

```scala
package a
 
trait Foo[S] {
  def foo(t: S): Int = 123
}
 
/** Boo hides BooShouldNotAppearIsFoo
 *
 * @hideImplicitConversion BooShouldNotAppearIsFoo
 */
trait Boo[T]
trait ShouldNotAppear
 
object Boo {
  implicit class BooShouldNotAppearIsFoo(boo: Boo[ShouldNotAppear]) extends Foo[ShouldNotAppear]
  implicit class BooLongIsFoo(boo: Boo[Long]) extends Foo[Long]
}
```
