Having different signatures for mutable and immutable "pop" seems OK to me.

I'll fix "elements" method.

I think "first" element of stack is bottom element:

{code}
Stack(1, 2, 3).elements.collect == Seq(1, 2, 3)
{code}

So immutable.Stack "elements" method will be changed.

Probably, Stack.reverseIterator method should be added to return elements from top to bottom.
