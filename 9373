It is possible we can change the logic. But first, let's establish whether this is a bug or a feature request, because I am still of the opinion that we are doing nothing wrong.

The JLS and java binary compatibility in general is about backward compatibility. This situation is about forward binary compatibility." The JLS declares that moving a method upward in the class hierarchy is a binary compatible change," yes that's right. That is a statement about the binary compatibility of that artifact. It doesn't say anything about what implications that change might have on other code which is compiled against it.

There are a lot of things which are binary compatible changes, but it doesn't mean the change happens in a bubble and there are no consequences. When you compile against different bytecode, you will often generate different artifacts. This is as true in java as it is in scala.
