Regarding your first point ... what about some explicit $ string interpolator, which leaves $ alone?

I would tackle the third point by outright removing constant folding (SI-7542 is related), but then I have to figure out scala/bug#7174 first, I guess.

Anyway, I'll file bugs for those things where either lint could act a bit smarter or where a different approach is necessary.

Thanks for the hints!
