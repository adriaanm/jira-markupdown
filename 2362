Should have thought to try just one file before submitting the problem. The issue is an interaction between a list of Java and Scala files.

It's not pretty but I attached a tar file with the source files and a bash script showing how the compiler is being invoked.  I couldn't include my scala jars because of the upload size limit so you will need to tweak the script to point to your jars before the script will run. I downloaded and built the latest nightly build and can reproduce the issue.

There will be a list compiler errors because I only included a subset of files that I found to show the issue. My friend "the ambiguous Builder" message is buried in there.

Please let me know if I can provide any other information.  TIA for your efforts.
