after fixing SI-513, pos/bug1001 failed -- it turns out there was another bug hiding under SI-513's shroud 

This test case is derived from pos/bug1001, and may also be related to #1159

```scala
class A 
trait B[T <: B[T]] extends A
class C extends B[C]
class D extends B[D]

class Data { 
  // force computing lub of C and D
  val data: List[A] = List(new C, new D)    // inferred existential type does not meet T's bound B[T]
}
```

output with printLubs enabled: 
```scala
lub of List(D, C) at depth 2
  lub of List(D, C) at depth 1
    lub of List(D, C) at depth 0
    lub of List(D, C) is A
  lub of List(D, C) is B[_1] forSome { type _1 >: D with C <: A }
lub of List(D, C) is B[_2] forSome { type _2 >: D with C{} <: B[_1] forSome { type _1 >: D with C{} <: A } }
```

clearly,  `_2` in `B[_2] forSome { type _2 >: D with C{} <: B[_1] forSome { type _1 >: D with C{} <: A } }` is not a subtype of `B[_2]`

I don't know how to fix this more constructively but to detect f-bounded type params in  `mergePrefixAndArgs` and pretend `depth == 0`:

```scala
  def mergePrefixAndArgs(tps: List[Type], variance: Int, depth: Int): Option[Type] = tps match { // ...
    case TypeRef(_, sym, _) :: rest =>
//...
      val args = List.map2(sym.typeParams, List.transpose(argss)) {
        (tparam, as) =>
          if (depth == 0 || (tparam.info.bounds contains tparam)) //@M can't deal with f-bounds
```
bug1001 failed because the existential type that's constructed by  `mergePrefixAndArgs` does not meet the f-bounds.

Compiler output (edited to remove irrelevant stuff -- with printLubs enabled and some diagnostics in mergePrefixAndArgs):
```scala
lub of List(D, C) at depth 2
  lub of List(D, C) at depth 1
    lub of List(D, C) at depth 0
    lub of List(D, C) is A
MPAA of: List(B[D], B[C])
MPAA(params, sym, args) = (List(type _1 >: D with C <: A),trait B,List(_1))
  lub of List(D, C) is B[_ >: D with C <: A]
MPAA of: List(B[D], B[C])
MPAA(params, sym, args) = (List(type _2 >: D with C <: B[_ >: D with C <: A]),trait B,List(_2))
lub of List(D, C) is B[_ >: D with C <: B[_ >: D with C <: A]]

/Users/adriaan/git/scala/test/files/pos/ticket2251.scala:22: error: type arguments [_1] do not conform to trait B's type parameter bounds [T <: B[T]]
  val data: List[A] = List(new C, new D)
                      ^
one error found
```

Maybe this is the expected behaviour then? Should we focus on providing a better error message and leave mergePrefixAndArgs as it was?

Anyway, the inferred type is:

`B[_2] forSome { type _2 >: D with C{} <: B[_1] forSome { type _1 >: D with C{} <: A } }`  (not well-formed)

instead of the well-formed:

`B[_2] forSome { type _2  <: B[_2]}`

it's interesting that this first type is the unrolling (up to a certain depth) of the second one -- there's probably no complete algorithm to detect this and "roll the type back up", though... (is there?)  


I'm not sure whether this could work, but maybe we could improve mergePrefixAndArgs so that it detects f-bounds (with a more robust check) and then takes the type schema and replaces the type parameters by existentials?

E.g.,  `Foo[T <: Foo[U, U], U <: T]` would become `Foo[A, B] forSome {type A <: Foo[B, B]; type B <: A}`. As a further refinement, we could take the lub and glb of the type arguments that Foo was applied to and add them to the bounds of the type variables of the existential.

You can reclose this if you want, but I thought this was interesting enough.
```scala
class A 
trait B[T <: B[T]] extends A
class C extends B[C]
class D extends B[D]

class E {
  val ys = List(List(new C), Stream(new D))
}
```
If you compile with -Ydebug you can watch the malformed lubs as they are discarded.  Eventually it admits defeat:

```
./a.scala:10: error: type arguments [B[_ >: D with C <: B[_ >: D with C <: A]],scala.collection.immutable.LinearSeq[B[_ >: D with C <: A]] with scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized[B[_ >: D with C <: A],scala.collection.immutable.LinearSeq[A] with scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized[A,scala.collection.immutable.LinearSeq[Any] with scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized[Any,Any]]]] do not conform to trait LinearSeqOptimized's type parameter bounds [+A,+Repr <: scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized[A,Repr]]
  val ys = List(List(new C), Stream(new D))
      ^
```
