If you pass a single parameter then both methods are applicable, and the compiler tries to find out which one is more specific. It will find that none of the two is more specific than the other, both are applicable to parameters of types of the other (once via tuple conversion). see spec for `more specific`.

When you pass two parameters, only the second one is applicable. (The first one would work through tuple conversion, but this is only tired when no other alternative works).
