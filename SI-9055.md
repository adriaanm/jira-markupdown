This is a regression, it used to work with 2.10.4 but now after upgrading to 2.11.4 scalac is hanging indefinitely in the phase typer. 

Unfortunately I haven't managed to pinpoint which code is causing the problem although it is hanging while processing my `RegexParsers` class.
I enabled -verbose but no error is reported whatsoever.

I just rolled back to 2.10.4 and the project compiles fine once again.

Since I don't know from where the problem is coming from, I have attached the source code of the project. 
Removing  alternative `empty_temporal` from `da_gd` allows it to complete.

Actually, type-annotating it avoids the lub, if that's the right thing to do.
{noformat}
(empty_temporal: Parser[Expression with TimedCondition])
{noformat}

Maybe it's suffering in the neighborhood of Expression.Aux.

Is it a bad sign when TypeComparers is on its thirdTry? Well, there's also a fourthTry.

I just followed the suggestion at http://stackoverflow.com/q/27583857/1296806

The ascription I gave is different from the definition {{Parser[EmptyTemporal]}}.

What kills it is typing the {{a | b | c}}.

See the next issue SI-9056 for a similar stack trace.
