There is currently no way to check if a Java symbol is transient or not.

This is the case because `scala.reflect.internal.ClassfileConstants` does not translate the `JAVA_ACC_TRANSIENT` flag to a Scala flag. Therefore, checks with `{{hasFlag(Flags.TRANS_FLAG)}}` in symbols are negative for transitive variables in Java classes.

There is a [hack through reflection](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24125409/scala-macros-checking-if-a-java-field-is-marked-as-transient) that can be used to check this, but the fact that this case is not handled is bad for java interop and Serialization-intensive code.
