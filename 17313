this is a less severe form of scala/bug#6049. scala/bug#6049 was closed because the back end no longer crashes, but there are still spurious warnings.

so e.g. borrowing Miguel's minimized code from scala/bug#6049:
```
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-M6 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_33).

scala> :paste
object O {
  while(true) {
    var j = 0
    try j
    catch { case t: Throwable => }
  }
}
// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:11: warning: Visited SCOPE_EXIT before visiting corresponding SCOPE_ENTER. SI-6049
           try j
           ^
defined module O
```

at scala/bug#6049 Miguel said this warning could also be a sign of issues with "whether the debugger shows the variable in question"
