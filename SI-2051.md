The scaladoc for class DynamicVariable contains a reference to its old name, fluid. This had me confused when I first look it up, but only when looking at Scala language changes history I realized what it was talking about. Minor nit, but, then again, trivial to fix.

From the scaladoc:

Each thread gets its own stack of bindings. When a new thread is created, the fluid gets a copy of the stack of bindings from the parent thread, and from then on the bindings for the new thread are independent of those for the original thread.
