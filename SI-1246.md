Here is a minimal example that exposes the issue:

{code}
val iter = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).elements; val firstTwoElements = iter.zipWithIndex.takeWhile(_._2 < 2).toList; val x = iter.toList
{code}

Results from the interpreter: 

{code}
iter: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator
firstTwoElements: List[(Int, Int)] = List((1,0), (2,1))
x: List[Int] = List(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
{code}

Note that the 3 is dropped from the iterator ({{x}}) when it shouldn't be. zipWithIndex or takeWhile on their own do not exhibit this behaviour, it appears to be only the combination of the two.

Here's the full example: http://gist.github.com/6329 & http://gist.github.com/6326

This happens on 2.7.1 final & 2.7.1.r15535-b20080712185233, not sure if its broken in HEAD.

`takeWhile` consumes one more element than necessary (the first one that makes the predicate false). This can be shown even without `zipWithIndex`:

{code}
scala> val xs = List(1, 2, 3, 4)  
xs: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val iter = xs.elements
iter: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> iter.takeWhile(_ < 2).toList       
res10: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> iter.toList
res11: List[Int] = List(3, 4)
{code}

The combination of the two removes 2 elements, for some reason. At first glance, this needs a bit of library redesign, since `takeWhile` can't be implemented in unbuffered iterators (unless we specify the current behavior as being what we want).
I think documenting it is the wrong solution, it's an issue that needs resolving.

An easy (though potentially naive) fix would be to return an iterator from {{takeWhile}} that simply returned the last taken element (the first that doesn't match the predicate) as the first element in the new iterator (the first call to {{hasNext}} or {{next}}).

Here's a quick and dirty hack that shows this (doubt this actually works):

{code}
new Iterator[A] {
  val first = lastTakenThatDoesNotMatch
  val wrapped = wrappedIterator
  var taken = false

  override def hasNext = !taken || wrapped.hasNext

  override def next = 
    if (!taken) {
      taken = true
      first
    } else {
      wrapped.next
    }
}
{code}
