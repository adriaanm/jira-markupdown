@adriaanm I need to do more extensive testing to see if we will clobber performance too greatly in 2.11 if we fix this the way that will work with binary compatibility (i.e. intercept it in the superclass).  Since this is a potentially dangerous change, I want to make sure to test in a variety of scenarios (e.g. with and without multiple dispatch).  I will retarget if the results of testing are disappointing.
