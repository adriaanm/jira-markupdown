Given this program:
```scala
class C[A] {
  type CC[B] <: C[B]
  def aio[T]: T = aio[T]
}
class D[A] extends C[A] {
  protected def nv[B](elems: Iterator[B]): CC[B] = {
    val x = new D[B]
    x.aio[CC[B]]
  }
}
```
you get the following error:
```scala
/home/odersky/scala/test/files/new/hkcasts.scala:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : x.CC[B]
 required: D.this.CC[B]
    x.aio[CC[B]]
      ^
one error found
```
The reason is found in the following lines in Typers.scala 
```scala
//@M TODO -- probably ok
//@M example why asSeenFrom is necessary: class Foo[a] { def foo[m[x]]: m[a] } (new Foo[Int]).foo[List] : List[Int]
//@M however, asSeenFrom widens a singleton type, thus cannot use it for those types
val resultpe = if (resultpe0.isInstanceOf[SingletonType]) resultpe0 else resultpe0.asSeenFrom(prefixType(fun), fun.symbol.owner) 
```
It interpretes the type parameter in the context of the function's prefix, which is clearly wrong. The line was introduced to fix a problem with higher-kinded type instantiation, but it is 
the wrong way to solve this problem. So a new way has to be found.

I've looked at the code and I think that hack should've been removed already, the case it's supposed to handle doesn't occur anymore because of improvements to `instantiateTypeParams`.  Sorry!!

Running an `ant dist` and if all goes well, will commit to trunk.

The code is now:
```scala
              val resultpe = restpe.instantiateTypeParams(tparams, targs)
              //@M substitution in instantiateParams needs to be careful!
              //@M example: class Foo[a] { def foo[m[x]]: m[a] = error("") } (new Foo[Int]).foo[List] : List[Int]
              //@M    --> first, m[a] gets changed to m[Int], then m gets substituted for List, 
              //          this must preserve m's type argument, so that we end up with List[Int], and not List[a]
              //@M related bug: SI-1438 
              //println("instantiating type params "+restpe+" "+tparams+" "+targs+" = "+resultpe)
              copy.TypeApply(tree, fun, args) setType resultpe
```
