All scala 2.9.1 tools (scalac, scaladoc...) don't accept filenames in OpenVMS or Unix format as parameters. No problem with scala 2.9.0.1.

Example:

$ scalac "-verbose" "/DKA100/JAVA/scala-2_9_1/samples/hello.scala"
...

error: source file '' could not be found
one error found
  
I doubt it has anything to do with the filename or the operating system.  You're feeding in an empty string somehow.  In 2.9.0-1 empty strings were dropped from the program arguments, but this was itself a bug (e.g. SI-4782.)

You can get the identical error like this.
{noformat}
% scalac291 ""
error: source file '' could not be found
one error found
{noformat}
