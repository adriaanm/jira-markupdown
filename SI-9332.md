Example code:

```scala
val (x, y) = Iterator.iterate(0)(_ + 1).take(6).span(_ != 1)
println(x.next(), x.hasNext, y.next(), x.hasNext, x.toVector)
```

Expected result:

```scala
(0,false,1,false,Vector())
```

Actual result:

```scala
(0,false,1,true,Vector(2, 3, 4, 5))
```

The problem is in the implementation of the `Leading` class in `Iterator.span`, which doesn't remember that the test condition (`p(self.head) == false`) has already been reached.

A solution is to add a class variable `var finished = false`, which is set when the condition fails in `advance()`:

```scala
def advance() = {
  !finished && self.hasNext && (if (p(self.head)) {
      lookahead += self.next
      true
    } else {
      finished = true
      false
    })
}
```

The implementation remains non-thread-safe.
