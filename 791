Using Unicode characters looks like more trouble than advantage.  As soon as you use non-ASCII characters, you create places where Scala code cannot work.  For example, copy-pasting Scala code between applications becomes unreliable.  Also, even with Unicode-enabled apps, you do not always have the correct fonts available.  Even when you do, they do not always mesh nicely with the other fonts you are using.

These problems are real productivity killers when they crop up, thus outweighing the advantages of having nice-looking glyphs.   In addition, there is nothing stopping an IDE from **displaying** Scala code using nicer glyphs....
