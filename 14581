One additional bug in scaladoc: in the API generated for 2.7.7.RC1, the page for {{scala/swing/event/ListSelectionChanged.scala}} links to the source file {{http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_7_7_RC1/src/swing/scala/swing/event/ListSelectionChanged.scala}}, which does not exist. {{ListSelectionChanged}} is actually a case class whose source code is in {{SelectionEvent.scala}}.
