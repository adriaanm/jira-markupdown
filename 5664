That works, but is not exactly the same thing.

When matching a large set of string against a single regex, the method I propose ought to be more efficient since it will reuse a compiled regex:

[http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#matches(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.CharSequence)]

_If a pattern is to be used multiple times, compiling it once and reusing it will be more efficient than invoking this method each time._
