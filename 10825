I've been playing with an idea to have something like: ``...'` to mean `q"""..."""`:
```scala
(stats: Tree, i: Int) => `println(s"executing $${stat.toString}"); $stat'
```

Where
```scala
$$foo
```
means unquote two levels deep, not escape dollar within string interpolation. Number of dollars is the same as how many levels deep you are, not `â‰ˆlevelsdeep^2` as it is now.  

It also works nicely if you want to write quasiquotes that produce other quasiquotes without any need for escaping whatsoever:
```scala
val valfx = `val fx = f(`x')'
```

Of course this is just surface syntax idea, the underlying desugaring stays the same.
