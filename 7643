Yep, I think so. But we can try it out in some real world macros in 2.10.1 already with the macro-initiated repair.

I'm working towards this for async, but its not trivial, as if we remove the resetAttrs calls, the rest of the macro actually breaks, because we splice untyped trees underneath typed trees, as well as the reverse. So we really need to drop down to lower-level mechanisms, like {{TreeGen.mkAttributedStableRef}}, and manual symbol creation. I think we really need to do this anyway so as not to mess up singleton types.
