The reflective compiler seems unable to instantiate Java generic classes that use raw types for F-bounded polymorphism.
As shown in minimal test (attached), we can instantiate instances of `GoodPoint` from the reflective compiler:
```scala
public class GoodBase<SelfT extends GoodBase<?,?>, ElemT> {
 /* ... */
}
public class GoodPoint extends GoodBase<GoodPoint,Double> {
 /* ... */
}
```
But we get a `CyclicReference` exception from the reflective compiler if we try to instantiate `BadPoint`:
```scala
public class BadBase<SelfT extends BadBase, ElemT> {
 /* ... */
}
public class BadPoint extends BadBase<BadPoint,Double> {
 /* ... */
}
```
The Scala code snippet we are testing is:
```scala
 import actest.BadPoint
 val spt = new BadPoint(10)
 val s = spt.toString
 println("directCallTest: spt.toString ==> " + s)
```
The only difference between `GoodPoint` and `BadPoint` is the use of wilcard template parameters in the recursive template in `GoodBase` vs the raw type in the corresponding position in `BadBase`.
The above code snippet works fine if compiled directly but throws when used with the reflective compiler. The same code snippet using `GoodPoint` does not exhibit this issue.
