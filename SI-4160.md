=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===

There is some code in the Scala library which uses code like

{code}
  public String toString() { return "" + foo; }
{code} 

The problem is that this creates an useless StringBuilder instance which is a waste of time and memory and greatly increases the amount bytecode.


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Either:

{code}
  public String toString() { return String.valueOf(foo); } // Except for foo of type Array[Char]
{code}

or (if you want to avoid a layer of indirection for value types):

{code}
  public String toString() { return java.lang.<PRIMITIVE_TYPE>.toString(foo) }
{code}

Commit message should be something like "Fixed toString methods to avoid useless creation of StringBuilder instances for trivial code("" + foo). (Position.scala and BoxesRunTime.java need one append less.)", but I couldn't figure out how do change that afterwards in Git ...
(In r23987) Optimization to string concatenation.  Our hands are sufficiently dirty
with a primitive CONCAT and several opcodes, I'm assuming nobody will oppose
this on principle.  Given an expression of the exact form "" + x
(that is, the NPE-immune and much less ugly way to call .toString) we used
to get 4x the bytecode and create an unneeded StringBuilder.  Now this:

0:	aload_1
1:	invokestatic	SI-20; //Method java/lang/String.valueOf:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/String;
4:	areturn

Closes SI-4160, review by dragos.
