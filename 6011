As I have just realized, spacing is missing because of *longer parameter names* and not because of #define. So my first example is not correct, I should have taken a long parameter name, not just _x_.

Scaladoc seems to assume a maximum length of parameter names what turns out to be inappropriate.

Scaladoc-Version: 2.9.0.final
