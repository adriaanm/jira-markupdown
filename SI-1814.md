In the following code, whether an implicit conversion is found by the compiler depends on the order of modules in the file, and on whether the method is called explicitly in a seperate statement:

{code}
// code doesn't compile, no suitable implicit found for the last println
object Foo extends Application {
  import Utils.string2FooString;
  //println(string2FooString("%s = %s") % ("foo", "bar")); // this line causes next line to compile!
  println("str" % ("foo", "bar"));
}

// if this module is moved to the top of the file, the code compiles
object Utils {
  class FooString(s: String) {
    def % (arg1: String, arg2: String) = arg1+arg2;
  }
    
  implicit def string2FooString(s: String) = new FooString(s)
}
{code}
This is essentially a duplicate of SI-1209 and at least one other ticket I can't find right now.  If you want your implicits to work everywhere, declare the return type.
{code}
  implicit def string2FooString(s: String): FooString = new FooString(s)
{code}
That works.
{code}
  //println(string2FooString("%s = %s") % ("foo", "bar")); // this line causes next line to compile!
{code}
That works because calling it explicitly causes the return type to be resolved.
{code}
// if this module is moved to the top of the file, the code compiles
{code}
That works because then the implicit's return type is resolved before it gets to the operation which needs it.
Ah, there's the one I couldn't find: SI-801.

"I have implemented a slightly more permissive rule: An implicit conversion without explicit result type is visible only in the text following its own definition. That way, we avoid the cyclic reference errors. I close for now, to see how this works. If we still have issues we migth come back to this."
