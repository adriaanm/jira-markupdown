The following code runs without problems using a self defined main method, but blocks inside *Application*
```scala

import actors._	
val join = Actor.self

val count = 3

for( i <- 0 until count) Actor.actor
{
	join ! 'ok
}

var num = 0

while(num < count)
{
	println("before receive")	
	
	join.receive
	{
		case 'ok => 
		{
			num += 1
			println(num)
		}
		case _ => println("should not happen")
	}

	println("after receive")
}

println("done")
```
