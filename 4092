Note the signatures of the methods you are calling:
{code}
def ^^^[U](r: U): Parser[U]

def | [U >: T](q: ⇒ Parser[U]): Parser[U]

def ^^[U](f: (T) ⇒ U): Parser[U]   
{code}

`^^^` is strict in its argument, `|` is not, and `^^` accepts a function.  So, the behavior you see is expected given these signatures.  I don't know whether it is intended for `^^^` to be strict or not.  It is strict in 2.8.0.RC2 as well.
