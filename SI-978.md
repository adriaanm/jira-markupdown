{code}
class A[+T] {
    def x[U >: T](s: U) { }
    def x[U >: T](ss: U*) { }
}

new A[String]().x("a")
{code}

Compiler reports:

{code}
error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method x in class A of type [U >: String](U*)Unit
and  method x in class A of type [U >: String](U)Unit
match argument types (java.lang.String)
new A[String]().x("a")
                 ^
{code}

I think first method should be called.

Because of this bug, call to immutable.Stack.push is ambiguous.
Adding my vote to this. 
A shorter example, as alluded to by Stepan in his last line:

(new collection.immutable.Stack[String]).push("foo")

Making the immutable Stack datatype unusable is a real problem! :)

It's been fixed in immutable.Stack for the moment. But for future reference, the way to address situations like this is the following:
{code}
   def x[U >: T](s: U) { }
   def x[U >: T](s1: U, s2: U, ss: U*) { }
{code}
No changes to the overloading resolution algorithm are needed.
