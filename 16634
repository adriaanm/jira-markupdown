Scalaxb generates client-side stubs for WSDL SOAP webservices. The Salesforce's Enterprise WSDL (7.6K LOC) causes an explosion of the xmlprotocol.scala file to become 19K LOC. A compilation fails after 45 minutes with a stackoverflow error with high memory usage. A normal compilation takes roughly 2 minutes.

See the attachment for the compiler log, generated file, and the project's build file. A standalone example can be provided if needed.
