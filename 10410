That's not relevant to the error message. The error message says "this is a scalac bug". As long as there is a scalac bug it isn't going to issue an error message about your code, because that's what the scalac bug is - that it doesn't do exactly that. As soon as it issues a sensible error message, there isn't a scalac bug anymore, there is only a bug in your code.
