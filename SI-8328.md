scala> val a:Int = a + 1
a: Int = 1

Same with String:
scala> val a:String = "a"+a
a: String = anull

Probably this behavior should be interpreted as error.
This has been raised before and discussed on the mailing lists.

The compiler can't rule it out in general. For example, this program is valid:

```scala
scala> val f: Int => Int = (a: Int) => if (a < 0) 0 else f(a - 1)
f: Int => Int = <function1>

scala> f(45)
res0: Int = 0
```

We do have a list of check's that we'd like to incorporated into a lint checker, and I'll add this one.
