It's purely a syntactic issue.  With immutable Map, you can do something like the following:
```scala
val m1 = Map('a -> 1, 'b -> 2)
val m2 = m1('a) = 3
```

Unfortunately, Vector uses "updated" rather than "update", standing out as the **only** collection to break with this convention.  It also does not implement the + operator, which is particularly bizarre given the fact that + has been conventionally used in Scala for sequence append.

If you prefer, I can start a thread on some mailing list regarding this issue so that we don't have to hijack a closed bug.
