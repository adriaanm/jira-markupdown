The Rich* wrapper classes should document how to create one
when necessary. For example, !RichString should mention
using Predef.stringWrapper(String) to create a !RichString from a String.

It is necessary to manually code a call to the wrapper
to resolve implicit ambiguities in some cases, such as
described at
