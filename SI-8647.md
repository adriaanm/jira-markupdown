If you invoke map on a mutable.BitSet with a function of type Int => Int, you get an "ambiguous implicit values" error:

```scala
val bs = scala.collection.mutable.BitSet()
bs.map(_ + 1)

error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both method newCanBuildFrom in class SortedSetFactory of type [A](implicit ord: Ordering[A])scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[scala.collection.mutable.SortedSet.Coll,A,scala.collection.mutable.SortedSet[A]]
 and method canBuildFrom in object BitSet of type => scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[scala.collection.mutable.BitSet,Int,scala.collection.mutable.BitSet]
 match expected type scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[scala.collection.mutable.BitSet,Int,That]
```

Interestingly, this error does not occur with immutable.BitSet, despite having two similar implicit CanBuildFrom instances available as well.

If I had to guess, I would start from [Improved BitSet implementations](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2d0f82898dc6e3998db425dbab571ba297deda41).

I hit this problem in 2.11.7, and can confirm it in 2.10.1, 2.11.0, 2.12.0-M2 as well. No problem in 2.9.3 (which does not include the aforementioned commit). This is just a guess.
