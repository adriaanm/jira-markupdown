If any import statement in the block precedes any dynamic invocation, the compiler reports the following error: {{erroneous or inaccessible type}}.

{code:scala}
object Test extends App {
  import language.dynamics

  class D extends Dynamic {
    def selectDynamic(name: String): String = name
  }

  def test = {
    import scala.Some // everything is fine if removed
    val d = new D
    println(d.field)
  }

  test
}
{code}

For posterity:
 * this went in 2.11.0-RC1 from a nice error message to a compiler crash in icode (after [5024246|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/502424684ac04a69480973af4fa82286f71a6d1c])
 * which was then fixed in 2.11.0-RC2 by [eb4a2e3|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/eb4a2e3343c9ee0ceaa249fc36b257dd6c13edf3]
