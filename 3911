I can fix this in the new pattern matcher, but first names-defaults has to support leaving the dummy <unapply-selector> in place for an unapply call with defaults
A reference to `argDummy` (see below) should not be extracted to a new local variable.
```scala
val argDummy  = context.owner.newValue(nme.SELECTOR_DUMMY, fun.pos, SYNTHETIC) setInfo pt
```
