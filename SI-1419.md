Currently (change set 16246 of trunk) named inner classes always contain a reference to their enclosing object, regardless of whether it is use or not.  This is similar to the old behavior of anonymous inner classes as demonstrated in https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/854 .  I think named inner classes should not retain a reference to the enclosing object if it is not required so that subtle memory leaks can be avoided.
I've read comments to #854, and now I'm not sure.

What would be the *harm* in changing the behavior?  I think changing it would lead to less surprises, which is almost always a good thing.

```scala
val m = new WeakHashMap[A, Something]

class A {
  class X
  def f = new X
}

def g = {
val a = new A
m += (a, someValue)
a.f
}
```
someValue will be garbage collected if X has no reference to outer class.

Separate compilation is one of the challenges, since you can't look at the class definition in order to decide whether we'll ever need to determine its outer instance. For example, the semantics of a type test pattern that includes a path, such as `x: prefix.Nested` compiles to `x.outer eq prefix && x.isInstanceOf[Nested]`. 

Is it an option to simply not nest this class?

PS: there's an undocumented "feature" that final nested classes don't receive outer pointers (unless required):
```scala
âžœ  ~  scalac -Xprint:cleanup /tmp/outer.scala
[[syntax trees at end of                   cleanup]] // outer.scala
package <empty> {
  class C extends Object {
    def <init>(): C = {
      C.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  };
  final class C$FinalNested extends Object {
    def <init>($outer: C): C$FinalNested = {
      C$FinalNested.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  };
  class C$Nested extends Object {
    <synthetic> <paramaccessor> <artifact> protected val $outer: C = _;
    <synthetic> <stable> <artifact> def $outer(): C = C$Nested.this.$outer;
    def <init>($outer: C): C$Nested = {
      if ($outer.eq(null))
        throw null
      else
        C$Nested.this.$outer = $outer;
      C$Nested.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

for
```scala
class C {
  final class FinalNested 
  class Nested 
}
```
To see the difference in pattern matching due to the lack of outer pointer, check out what the following snippet looks like at phase cleanup:
```scala
class D {
  val c1 = new C
  val c2 = new C
  val fn1 = new c1.FinalNested
  val fn2 = new c2.FinalNested
  val n1 = new c1.FinalNested
  val n2 = new c2.FinalNested

  (n1: Any) match { case x: c2.FinalNested => x}
  (fn1: Any) match { case x: c2.Nested => x}
}
```

Spoiler:

```scala
- if (x1.$isInstanceOf[C$FinalNested]().&&(true))
+ if (x1.$isInstanceOf[C$Nested]().&&((x1.$asInstanceOf[C$Nested](): C$Nested).$outer().eq(D.this.c2())))
```
First of all, mind blown with `throw null`, hadn't seen that done before :-)

Although I'm happy to use `final` as a work-around, I'm not sure I fully understand why `final` semantics obviates the need for an outer instance. Is that because a non-final nested can be extended outside outer? Or what's the scenario here?
Thanks for the explanation, Adriaan!

I'm beginning to wish Scala's default would be final, with some keyword to allow extension, perhaps `open class Foo`. Maybe in Dotty? :-)

BTW, given the explanation, is there any hope this issue having any other resolution that "Won't Fix", i.e. why it's still open?
So, if I understand this correctly, it's necessary for dealing with separate compilation units, which doesn't exist when using `final`. However, wouldn't that also apply to private nested classes? They also keep a reference to outer. They can be extended of course, but only in the same class thus compilation unit.
Yes, good point -- private members are *effectively* final, which is a notion we introduced more recently than the potentially-elide-outers-for-final-classes optimization, I think, so it would make sense to move to the more general criterion.
Also just realized that lifted nested methods contain outer reference:

```scala
  @Test
  def methodLift {
      def isPrime(c: Int) = BigInt(c).isProbablePrime(1)
    assertNoOuter(isPrime)
  }
  @Test
  def asFunction {
    val isPrime = (c: Int) => BigInt(c).isProbablePrime(1)
    assertNoOuter(isPrime)
  }
  private def assertNoOuter(f: Int => Boolean) {
    assertFalse(f.getClass.getDeclaredFields.exists(_.getType == this.getClass))
  }
```

`methodLift` fails, `asFunction` passes.
I opened a separate issue for the last one:
#9390
Aha! Even better, Jason already fixed this in #9408 (Avoid capturing outer class in local classes.)
Adriaan, is 9408 the same? It seems to be a *change* in capture, not an elimination.
