I and Jason discussed on Github [1] a StackOverflowException introduced in 2.10.2 (compared to 2.10.1) and in 2.11.0-M4, introduced according to him by [2]. He ran out of time chasing this bug, so I'm filing a ticket with what we have now. The bug is not minimized yet, but that will take some time.

The code base to reproduce this is available on github: take ps-mr/LinqOnSteroids as of [3], comment back in the offending code (commented out in that commit), or take the previous commit and change build.sbt to use a different Scala version, run "sbt compile" and watch Scalac explode.

The stacktrace repeats this fragment:
```scala
    at scala.reflect.internal.Types$CommonOwnerMap.traverse(Types.scala:5100)
    at scala.reflect.internal.Types$TypeTraverser.apply(Types.scala:4351)
    at scala.reflect.internal.Types$TypeMap.mapOver(Types.scala:4246)
```
