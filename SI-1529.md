```scala

package a
protected private[a] class A

```

surely this shouldn't compile (SLS 5.2)? what is this, C++? ;-)
Surprisingly enough, this actually is meaningful.  Consider
```scala
package a
class A {
  protected private[a] val x : Int = 0
}
```
Here subclasses of `A` in package `a` can access x, but subclasses of `A` outside of package `a` cannot, and everyone that is not a subclass of `A` cannot access it.
doesn't SLS 5.2 need to be changed, then? it appears to me that the grammar does not allow this case, nor is there any discussion of it in the text.  And the text says "Class-private or object-private members may not be deferred, and may not 
have protected, final or override modÔ¨Åers."  (oh and btw there's a typo in the last word there)

Thanks. I can see now I was wrong about the grammar part, but I'm still curious about the text.
