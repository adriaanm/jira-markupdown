isolated and minimized:
```scala
trait Compute[A] {
  type Start
  val start: Compute[Start]
}

object Test {
  def foo[A](c: Compute[A]): Unit =
    c match {
      case c: Compute[A] =>
        new Compute[A] {
          type Start = c.Start
          val start = c.start
        }
    }
}
```

Perhaps it can be minimized further, but I got stuck here. In particular, I did not succeed in getting rid of the pattern match.

This almost certainly has to do with the changes in type inference for valdefs that came in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5141. As evidence, compiling with 2.12.0-M5 makes the error go away, as does compiling with -Xsource:2.11.
