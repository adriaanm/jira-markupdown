The call doesn't need to be from Java... This happens whenever the target of the call is statically typed as the interface:

Java:
{code}
public interface Test {
    public void foo(String... args);
}
{code}

Scala:
{code}
class Foo extends Test {
  def foo(args: String*) = println(args)
}
new Foo().foo("hi") // fine
(new Foo(): Test).foo("hi") // AbstractMethodError
{code}

This is particularly dangerous, of course, because you have no idea where the error will actually occur...
