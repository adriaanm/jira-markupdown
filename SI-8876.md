From http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Map :

Look at {{filter}}'s compact type signature:
{noformat}filter(p: ((A, B)) ⇒ Boolean): Map[A, B]{noformat}

This type signature makes sense. I can pass in a function that takes a tuple of (key, value) and returns a boolean.

Now look at {{map}}'s compact type signature:
{noformat}map[B](f: (A) ⇒ B): Shrinkable[B]{noformat}

I interpret this as "map takes in a function which takes a key and returns an arbitrary type", but it actually means "map takes in a function which takes a tuple of (key, value) and returns an arbitrary type".

Here {{A}} actually refers to {{(A, B)}} (from Map extending {{Iterable\[(A, B)\]}}?), which is the confusing part.

Perhaps this type signature would be less confusing:
{noformat}map[C](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ C): Shrinkable[C]{noformat}

?
Yep, this sort of thing is really annoying, and is a known problem with use cases. See also SI-6071 / SI-5678 and a few like them.
See also [this|http://www.slideshare.net/extempore/a-scala-corrections-library/13] and [this|http://www.slideshare.net/extempore/a-scala-corrections-library/15] in case you're wondering whether it has ever come up before.
It's also interesting to note that the full signature for `Map#map` is also misleading:

{code}
Full Signature
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That
{code}

Disambiguating:

{code}
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B/*a type parameter of class Map*/)) ⇒ B /*a type parameter of method map*/) ...
{code}


Yeah, that is the example in [the slide in between those other two slides|http://www.slideshare.net/extempore/a-scala-corrections-library/14]. I substituted K and V for the class type parameters.

It's not real surprising nobody has fixed the "full signature" either. Apparently this is just how business is done.

I've spun the issue with full signatures into a separate ticket, SI-8887. I don't know how to fix it and would welcome suggestions.
Another incorrect inherited Scaladoc comment, reported as SI-9092.

The usecase for {{Option#zip}}:
{noformat}def zip[B](that: GenIterable[B]): Option[(A, B)]{noformat}

claims that zip returns an Option.

It doesn't:
{noformat}
scala> Some(5).zip(Some(3))
res8: Iterable[(Int, Int)] = List((5,3))
{noformat}

Instead it returns a List.
