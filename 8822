I have had a torrid time to reproduce this minimally. Here are some oddities

{code:title=a.b.c.d.Functions.scala}
package a.b //if these 3 package declarations are replaced by a.b.c.d it compiles OK
package c
package d

trait Functions {

  import Conversions._ //omit this line and it compiles OK
  val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
}
{code}
The above will also fail to compile with the error
{noformat}
error: value strlen is not a member of String
val toStrLen = (_ : String).strlen
{noformat}
