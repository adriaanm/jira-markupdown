(In r24642) Modified some typer logic to allow annotation arguments for constants
which don't have the form Literal(_).  The current logic seems to be
avoided most of the time, but scaladoc breaks when it runs into it.
This closes scala/bug#4301.  I can't figure out from the ticket what the deal
is with scala/bug#2764 and what is presently happening, but it seems like this
patch could only improve the situation.  Review by rytz.
