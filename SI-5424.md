It's either my lack of understanding what private should do, but to me the following is pretty surprising

http://ideone.com/FaQkD

  class A {
    val log = 1
  }

  trait B {
    private val log = ""
  }

  trait BB extends B {
    //no way to use log
//    log
  }

  trait C extends A with BB {
  }

However in the REPL there are some scenarios where it does work as expected.

In the future please enclose an error message.
{code}
trait B0 { val log = "a" }
trait B1 { private val log = "b" }

// ./a.scala:7: error: overriding value log in trait B0 of type String;
//  value log in trait B1 of type String has weaker access privileges; it should not be private
// class C1 extends B0 with B1
//       ^
// one error found
class C1 extends B0 with B1

// no error
class C2 extends B1 with B0

// Error can also be avoided by defining B1 as:
// trait B1 { private[this] val log = "b" }
{code}

It was a misunderstanding on my  part of how private, private really is.
