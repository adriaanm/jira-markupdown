If a no arg method returns a function and there is an overloaded version of the same method then you can't invoke the returned function without calling .apply or assigning to a temp variable.

Sample code: 

val f = Some({x : Int => println("it's " + x)})
(f.get)(0)

Results in "warning: method get in class Option is deprecated
       (f.get)(0)
          ^
res0: Any = <function>"

// The function can be invoked by calling apply
scala> (f.get).apply(0)
it's 0

// Or by assigning to a temp variable
scala> val temp = f.get
temp: (Int) => Unit = <function>

scala> temp(0)
it's 0
