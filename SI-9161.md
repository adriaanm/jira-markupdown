I have just tested Scala's JSR223 support by dropping the JAR http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-compiler/2.11.5/scala-compiler-2.11.5.jar into my classpath and when the ScriptEngineManager iterates over all the ScriptEngineFactory providers, it fails for Scala with:

```
ScriptEngineManager providers.next(): javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory: Provider scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain$Factory could not be instantiated
```

Unfortunately there's no stack trace printed so I don't have the inner cause.

Note that this is the same error as the one raised in #7790 which was supposedly fixed in Scala Compiler 2.10.4-RC1

Thanks!
If you're not using the `scala` runner, you'll need `scala-library.jar` to make the Engine class load and `scala-reflect.jar` to do something useful.

It was not supported in 2.10, so that other bug was a different packaging problem.
Thanks A.P.Marki and sorry for the not-a-bug issue...

FYI I'm trying to add support for scripting in scala inside XWiki: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-132

The next problem I get now (in case you have an idea) is:

```
[init] error: error while loading Object, Missing dependency 'object scala in compiler mirror', required by /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/lang/Object.class)

Failed to initialize compiler: object scala in compiler mirror not found.
** Note that as of 2.8 scala does not assume use of the java classpath.
** For the old behavior pass -usejavacp to scala, or if using a Settings
** object programatically, settings.usejavacp.value = true.
[init] error: error while loading Object, Missing dependency 'object scala in compiler mirror', required by /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/lang/Object.class)
```

Thanks again
I think you can just follow the instructions.  Cf #9159. As a last resort, or first resort, you'll get a wider audience on scala-user.
