When using """raw strings""" in Eclipse pluging for 2.8, the text editor incorrectly autocompletes by adding an extra double-quote, a plus and opening the next line with a double quote.

Example:

val rawString = """This is an example of a raw string"""

When pressing enter behind "string" results in:

val rawString = """This is an example of a raw string" +
        """"

This is only correct behaviour for normal strings:

val normalString = "This is an example of a normal string"

When pressing enter behing string results in:

val normalString = "This is an example of a normal string" +
        ""
