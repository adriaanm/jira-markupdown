investigate on 

```scala
def dup(s: String, n: Int = 2) = s*n
dup("fish")   // "fishfish"
List("fish","cow").map(dup)  // Error
```
I don't think this is worth the additional spec complexity; `List("fish","cow").map(dup(_))` isn't much longer.

Lukas, feel free to reopen if you feel strongly otherwise.
