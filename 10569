SI-1753 is related and instructive, but incomplete. It only says that
{code}
class A { type T }
{code}
is intentionally allowed.

But what about objects? Why is the following forbidden?

{code}
object WTF_A0 {
  type T //Error: only classes can have declared but undefined members
}
{code}

I don't think that objects were indeed meant to be special.

Otherwise, the following should be also forbidden:
{code}
trait A {
  type T
}
 
object A extends A
{code}

If this inconsistency is by design, I'd demand more explanation than this:
> I'm pretty sure it's been discussed before and it falls into the not-a-bug category.

Additionally, on the implementation level, the mere fact that the the check for undefined members is different from the check for undefined *inherited* members seem debatable â€” I guess the former can be done earlier, but it seems the two checks should still share logic.
