I have production code that looks like this
{{{
  aVeryBigCollection forall (e => aVeryBigImmutableMap.keySet(e.someProp))
}}}
This used to perform fine under 2.8.x because immutable.Map.keySet returned (correctly, in my opinion) a very cheap, set-like view of the keys of the immutable Map. It was an O(1) operation. Now it is an O\(n\) operation with no workaround to get back to O(1) (at least that I can find). I was also contend that the "principle of least surprise" is for keySet to return a view-like structure.

I suspect that this is a *done deal* and that there is no way of going back to the old behaviour, so I must request that there is a new method "keysView" or "keySetView" which provides the old functionality. In my experience keySet is **almost always** used in such a view-like manner
This was done at r23666, to fix #4001. Here's the log:

    immutable.Map keySet returns immutable.Set.  Closes #4001, no review.

And that's that. Scala.collection.keySet returns a protected KeySet class that does the trick, while scala.collection.immutable.keySet creates a new collection.

Commit by extempore.
this code shows the performance regression:
```scala
val m = Iterator.from(1).map(x => x -> x).take(100000).toMap
Iterator.continually(m.keySet).drop(1000).next
```

in 2.8 it runs in a fraction of a second, in 2.9 it takes 57 seconds.
