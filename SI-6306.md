A weird runtime exception by Try.apply


$ scala-2.10.0-M7/bin/scala -e 'scala.util.Try(1.toString)'

Same error can be reproduced in repl and in real compiled application using Test.scala:

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    scala.util.Try(1.toString)
  }
}

I just wanted to take some heat off of Try.  AnyVal._ lose their func wrappers.
{code}
object Min {
  def f[A](a: =>A) = println(a.toString)
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    f((1).toString)
    f((1).##)
  }
}
[[syntax trees at end of                   uncurry]] // simple-byname.scala
package badbyname {
  object Min extends Object {
    def <init>(): badbyname.Min.type = {
      Min.super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def f[A >: Nothing <: Any](a: () => A): Unit = scala.this.Predef.println(a.apply().toString());
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      Min.this.f[String](1.toString());
      Min.this.f[Int](1.##())
    }
  }
}
{code}

{{AnyVal}} is not needed in fact - the problem seems to appear on naked type variables with whatever bound, as shown in the below testcase:
{code}
object Min {
  //Don't work
  def f[A](a: =>A) = println(a.toString)
  def f1[A <: AnyVal](a: =>A) = println(a.toString)
  def f2[A <: AnyRef](a: =>A) = println(a.toString)
  def f2a[A <: String](a: =>A) = println(a.toString)
  //Works
  def f3[A](a: =>Seq[A]) = println(a.toString)
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    f3(Seq(1))
    f3(Seq())
    f((1).toString)
    f((1).##)
    f1((1).##)
    f2((1).toString)
    f2a((1).toString)
  }
}
{code}
I would have guessed that I caused that with https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/00a648bc909f794d91570fb962fc7d7fcd055bc5 which was a fix for SI-1247. But it seems this bug seems to be present in 2.10.0-M1 as well.
But I guess it's just introducing the cast because the lifting to {{Function0}} from uncurry is missing (I think, that's what Paolo meant with "lose their func wrappers"). As Paolo mentioned this happens only for {{.toString}}, {{.##}}, and {{.hashCode}} calls. Extra points if you find others.
In this commit, the tree {{Select(Const(1), "toString")}} is considered safe to inline. 

  https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/fa2deeb4#L1R84

This seems to trigger a long latent bug in {{Uncurry}}:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.10.0-M7/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/UnCurry.scala#L215

But I'm not sure yet what should go there instead.
Bonus points, please:

{code}
scala210 -nocompdaemon -e "def foo[A](a: => A) = a; foo(1.getClass())"

Community spirit badge if the PR fixes the comment {{Note that this is not called "isExprSafeToInline"}} to {{Note that this is not called "isPureExpr"}}.

Kind of a "ceci n'est pas une pipe" moment. I read that in the middle of the night and stopped blinking for an indeterminate length of time.

>I think, that's what Paolo meant with "lose their func wrappers".
It was.  It's a little known and infrequently mulled fact that my middle name is Paul.  And full disclosure, in that comment, I almost wrote, "funky wrappers."

I retract my comment above, I debugged the wrong thing.
@Jason: deEta, the code you mention, seems to change the type of the result. A comment should explain when it's supposed to work. If it never does, it should be removed, but assuming that it works correctly in some cases, a very minimal attempt for the fix can be found here:
https://github.com/Blaisorblade/scala/tree/issue/6306

It does work on the testcase, but it seems overkill; I add a set named {{inByNameCallSite}} analogously to {{byNameArg}}, but I'm not sure if I could just use byNameArg because I can't fully read the code; I currently suspect that I couldn't.

_If_ this becomes a pull request, I'll add proper acknowledgments to everybody involved.
