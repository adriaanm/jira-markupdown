without MathContext there is a risk of ArithmeticException

```scala
val one  :BigDecimal = 1
val three:BigDecimal = 3

val result = one/three

java.lang.ArithmeticException: Non-terminating decimal expansion; no exact representable decimal result.
	at java.math.BigDecimal.divide(BigDecimal.java:1514)
	at scala.BigDecimal.$$div(BigDecimal.scala:168)

	at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:3)

```
java.math.BigDecimal has overloaded versions of divide operation
```scala
 BigDecimal  divide(BigDecimal divisor, int scale, RoundingMode roundingMode) 
 BigDecimal  divide(BigDecimal divisor, MathContext mc) 
```
I've attached an alternative decimal implementation that makes it so (1) a decimal always has a MathContext, and (2) the MathContext is part of the type.  Here's a sample interaction:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r0-b20090511215951 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_07).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val a = Decimal64(1)
a: Decimal64.Decimal = 1

scala> val b = Decimal64(3)
b: Decimal64.Decimal = 3

scala> a / b
res0: Decimal64.Decimal = 0.3333333333333333

scala> val c = Decimal32(3)
c: Decimal32.Decimal = 3

scala> a / c
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Decimal32.Decimal
 required: Decimal64.Decimal
       a / c
           ^

scala> 
```
As you can see it is well-behaved and won't let you randomly mix Decimals from different DecimalModule.
OK, let me know what you think of r18021.  I did not bring MathContext into the type system and am not very convinced it's wise.  I did make MathContext a part of BigDecimal, and it uses the mc on every operation.

You can change contexts with an apply method on BigDecimal, so:
```scala
scala> val x = BigDecimal(1.0)
x: BigDecimal = 1.0

scala> x / 3
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Non-terminating decimal expansion [...]

scala> x(DECIMAL32) / 3
res5: BigDecimal = 0.3333333

scala> x(DECIMAL64) / 3
res6: BigDecimal = 0.3333333333333333
```
Also I added some new methods, like:
```scala
scala> BigDecimal(100) /% 17
res7: (BigDecimal, BigDecimal) = (5,15)

scala> BigDecimal(100) quot 17
res8: BigDecimal = 5

scala> BigDecimal(100.0001).byteValueExact
java.lang.ArithmeticException: Rounding necessary
```

And etc.
(In r24547) My early attempts to implement non-integral ranges in a way which
was useful without having lots of floating point traps were less
than successful.  One of the bigger backfires is that the requirement
not to round (trying, and failing anyway, to avoid surprises with
methods like "contains") inflicts runtime errors.

The simple way to improve this, which seems a good idea anyway,
is to make the default math context something less inclined to
exceptions.  Default BigDecimal mc is now DECIMAL128.
References #1812, #4201 and puts #4201 back to normal priority.
