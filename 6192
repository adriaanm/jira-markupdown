Leave this one open. The changes have not been merged in trunk by somebody with commit privileges. The bug is currently assigned to the "community".

- we need the jansi maintainer to build a jansi release incorporating the changes from my pull request
- we need to have confidence we didn't break non win32 behavior and that win32 behavior works on various flavor or Win32 (32 and 64 bits)
- we probably need to build some momentum that this feature is in demand (may be voting up will help)
