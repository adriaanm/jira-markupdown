BTW, I did some experimentation with the implicit conversion as I suggested earlier, and found it interfered with type inference, making it not so useful (can't remember the exact details, it was a while ago)

So I withdraw my implicit conversion suggestion, and I'm keen to see this change done as soon as possible :-)
