I just created a Jira account so that I could report this bug; turns out it's already here, but closed!?

This may not be a compiler "bug", but it is a HUGE programmability/usability/API problem. I spent almost an hour trying to figure out why the compiler thought that "keychain <ins>= key" meant "keychain = (keychain.toString </ins> key.toString)" (which obviously fails to compile) after I split one class into two (so 'protected' was no longer permissive enough).

A bad diagnostic message is a programmability bug: the compiler fails to tell me what's really wrong.
