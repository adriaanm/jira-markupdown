This is in 2.9.1 as well as trunk.  Has to be a val.  Only happens when compiling source separately from the package object source.
```scala
// a.scala
package object foo {
  val m: List[_] = Nil
}
// b.scala
package foo

% scalac a.scala 
% scalac b.scala
error: type _$1 is defined twice
one error found
```
