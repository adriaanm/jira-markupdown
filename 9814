The root error stems from the fact that inference of parent type arguments (in `typedParentTypes` happens twice: first during type completion ({{Namer#classSig}}), and second during type checking ({{typedClassDef}}). To get a better look at it, compile with `-uniqid` and trace the following code in `typedPrimaryConstrBody`:
```scala
val cbody2 = { // called both during completion AND typing.
            val typer1 = newTyper(cscope)
            // XXX: see about using the class's symbol....
            clazz.unsafeTypeParams foreach (sym => typer1.context.scope.enter(sym))
            typer1.namer.enterValueParams(vparamss map (_.map(_.duplicate)))
            typer1.typed(cbody1)
          }
```


I'm not sure how to fix that.
