The `toString` method of `scala.collection.Map` ignores overrides of the `stringPrefix` method in subclasses and always uses `"Map"` instead, which violates the contract of its superclass `scala.Collection` and doesn't make sense either.
Ticket SI-1187 is a duplicate of this one and it was fixed with a patch identical to this one in r15763, so this can be closed.
