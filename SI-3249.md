	

I am using 2.8.0.r21010-b2010022802013

This problem affects all scala classiles I have tried.
It can be reproduced on the scala-library classes, eg:

{code}
$$ javac -cp scala-library.jar -Xprint scala.actors.Actor
error: cannot access scala.actors.Actor.$$anonfun$$receiveWithin$$1
class file for scala.actors.Actor$$$$anonfun$$receiveWithin$$1 not found
1 error
{code}

I believe this needs to work in order to process java classfile annotations in scala classfiles (ie by using -processor instead of -Xprint)
This is some kind of companion unhappiness.  In the example above you are giving scala.actors.Actor, but the class it's complaining about is a member of scala.actors.Actor$$, not Actor.  It looks like it happens pretty easily.
{code}
% cat a.scala 
object A { def f[T] = (x: T) => 5 }

% scalac a.scala 
% javac -cp .:scala-library.jar -Xprint 'A$$'

public final class A$$ implements scala.ScalaObject {
  public static final A$$ MODULE$$;

  public <T> scala.Function1<T,java.lang.Integer> f();

  private A$$();
}
% javac -cp .:scala-library.jar -Xprint 'A'
error: cannot access A.$$anonfun$$f$$1
bad class file: ./A$$$$anonfun$$f$$1.class
undeclared type variable: T
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
1 error

{code}
It's actually local-generic-classes-that-refer-to-the-method's-type-parameter unhappiness (granted, not as catch as companion unhappiness -- to compensate, reduced it to a one-liner):

{code}
// a.scala
class A[U] { def f[T] = { class X extends A[T] } }


/*
$$ scalac a.scala
$$ javac -cp .:$$SCALA_HOME/lib/scala-library.jar  -Xprint 'A$$X$$1'

    public class X$$1 extends A</*OHNOES where is T!1?*/> implements scala.ScalaObject {
      public X$$1();
    }

*/
{code}
I'm sure there are more cases where we generate javasigs that aren't up to snuff
part of the problem is I don't know what the spec of these things is (there is some obscure pdf by sunacle that Iulian pointed me to)
another aspect is that we can't test these things using partest (yet)
need to compile a scala file, then run javac -Xprint on all the generated classes and ensure the sigs are ok

for this example, and class `A$$X$$1`, the fix for this ticket ensures it looks like (note the `null` for the outer pointer argument's name...) 

{code}
$$ scalac a.scala
$$ javac -cp .:$$SCALA_HOME/lib/scala-library.jar  -Xprint 'A$$X$$1'

  public class X$$1 extends A<java.lang.Object> implements scala.ScalaObject {
    public X$$1(A<U> null);
  }
{code}
related to SI-3486 in that they require similar kind of testing
(In r22511) closes SI-3249. exclude method type parameters from java generic signature of a class
review by dragos
from SI-3801:

{code}
javac -cp experimental/users/mahler/scala/scala-2.8.0.r22830-b20100824020153/lib/scala-library.jar -Xprint scala.actors.Actor error: cannot access scala.actors.Actor.$$anonfun$$respondOn$$1 bad class file: scala/actors/Actor$$$$anonfun$$respondOn$$1.class(scala/actors:Actor$$$$anonfun$$respondOn$$1.class) undeclared type variable: A Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath. 1 error
{code}
So... this one is a bit subtle.   It looks like the rule of 3 applies here.  If I have a generic class with a generic method, then I need a third method that also has generics to get the invalid signature.   Here's my simplifying from Option what will cause the problematic classfile to be generated:

{code}
class A[U] { 
   def bar[B >: U](x : => B) = x
   def foo[C >: U](c : C) : C = bar(c)
}
{code}

Leads to the ever-so-helpful message:
{{jsuereth@jsuereth-laptop:~/projects/blog/type-fun$$ scalac dummy.scala 
jsuereth@jsuereth-laptop:~/projects/blog/type-fun$$ javac -cp .:/home/jsuereth/projects/scala/scala/build/quick/classes/library/ -Xprint A
error: cannot access A.$$anonfun$$foo$$1
bad class file: ./A$$$$anonfun$$foo$$1.class
undeclared type variable: C
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.

{code}

I tried reproducing without having the extra method and was unable to.  Something about the generic method that is auto-lifting the closure for another generic method is bypassing the logic Adrian added.   If you'd like me to some more investigated here, please let me know.

(In r23503) Generate EnclosingMethod classfile attributes. 
This should fix java signatures when they refer to
method type parameters. I unrolled Adriaans previous fix 
for SI-3249, as this one is more general. Closes SI-3249, 
review by moors.
