It would be nice if you could use the {{with}} keyword for the first trait a class extends, even when you don't extend any base class.

Like this

{code}
trait MyTrait

class MyClass with MyTrait
{code}

From the change log appendix to the old spec, "Changes in Version 2.0 (12-Mar-2006)":

“With” in extends clauses.

The idiom

{code}
class C with M { ... }
{code}

is no longer supported. A *with* connective is only allowed following an extends clause. 

if you read {{class A extends B with C}} with the knowledge that {{B with C}} is a valid type in itself, then the syntax choice that was made here makes a lot more sense. it's {{A extends (B with C)}}, not {{(A extends B) with C}}.

Mikael, nbd, but it's better to raise this sort of thing as a thread on the scala-language mailing list first, rather than going straight to JIRA. This is something of an FAQ.
There are several traits which are named so that "with ..." reads very nicely, such as {{Logging}}:

{code}
class MyClass with Logging
{code}

rather than

{code}
class MyClass extends Logging
{code}
