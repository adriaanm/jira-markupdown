I see no reason this should be allowed to happen, and a lot of reasons it shouldn't.
```scala
package foo
package _root_

object Test {
  import _root_.scala.Option
}
```
```
./a.scala:5: error: object scala is not a member of package foo._root_
  import _root_.scala.Option
                ^
one error found
```
So to be clear, that source should not compile, but it should not compile because *root* should be a reserved word.  The whole point of *root* is to know what you are importing.  Tying this into another ticket I opened recently:

```scala
// a.scala
package foo

import _root_.scala.Option

% scalac3 ./a.scala 
% mkdir -p foo/_root_
% scalac3 ./a.scala 
./a.scala:3: error: object scala is not a member of package foo._root_
import _root_.scala.Option
              ^
one error found
```
Jira is turning underscore-root-underscore into italics, which I'm sure is obvious, but anyway.
```
_root_
```
Maybe I misunderstand why this was given the label "error-messages" but this isn't about error messages. Perhaps an example is needed where it DOES compile but should certainly NOT compile.
```scala
package p {
  package _root_ {
    package scala {
      sealed trait Option[+T] { def isEmpty = false ; def donkey = 5 }
      final case class None[T]() extends Option[T] { def get: T = null.asInstanceOf[T] }
      final case class Some[T](x: T) extends Option[T] { }
    }
  }
}
// Meanwhile, in some other file
package p {
  object Test {
    import _root_.scala.Option
    def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x.donkey
  }
}
```
There is no "donkey" method on **root** .scala.Option. If **root** is to behave like any other relative package, then there is quite literally no reason for it to exist.

And conversely, this does NOT compile, but certainly SHOULD. **root**.scala.Option does have a "get" method.
```scala
package p {
  object Test2 {
    import _root_.scala.Option
    def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x.get
    // ./a.scala:18: error: value get is not a member of p._root_.scala.Option[T]
    //     def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x.get
    //                                ^
    // one error found
  }
}
```
This patch does not go far enough, I know. Not sure if we should push this all the way to all identifier names.
As a follow-up, I'm considering hard-wiring *root* in an import to the root package, and disallowing it as a nested name.
I was thinking about this issue today too for some reason.

I wonder what you think: one could argue that you must know what you're doing if you're defining you're own `\_root\_`, and perhaps it being definable is a handy last resort?
"You" can't rely on knowing what "you" are doing because there's no reason to expect the value of these two "you"s to coincide. 

If packages had been defined up front to be relative to an abstract root, and there were some facility for controlling where that root is, that could be useful - albeit impractical on the jvm, which doesn't offer any way to virtualize packages short of bytecode rewriting. But the whole reason people use \_root\_ is **they want to know what they're getting**. It's explicitly NOT a virtual path.

[It's in the specifiction](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/09-top-level-definitions.html): "The special predefined name \_root\_ refers to the outermost root package which contains all top-level packages."
