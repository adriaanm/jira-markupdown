=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
object Log { 
  def log(m: =>String) = println("1:"+m)  
  def log(m: String, args: Any*) = println("2:"+m) 
}
Log.log("test")

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

output of "2:test"

=== What do you see instead? ===

<console>:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method log in object Log of type (m: String,args: Any*)Unit
and  method log in object Log of type (m: => String)Unit
match argument types (java.lang.String)
       Log.log({"test"})
           ^

=== Additional information ===

In some cases like above, I think it obvious that designer of the Log class intended
the second log method to be called if no varags are passed by the caller.
