There seems to be some inconsistent handling of varargs by Scala. Consider these two classes:

{code}
class X {
  def f(x: AnyRef) = x.toString
  def f(x: AnyRef, y: AnyRef*) = y.mkString(x.toString)
}

class Y {
  def f(x: Int) = x.toString
  def f(x: Int, y: Int*) = y.mkString(x.toString)
}
{code}

The ambiguity with {{f}} is resolved differently:

{code}
scala> new X
res0: X = X@442c76

scala> val x : AnyRef = "a"
x: AnyRef = a

scala> res0.f(x)
<console>:8: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method f in class X of type (x: AnyRef,y: AnyRef*)String
and  method f in class X of type (x: AnyRef)java.lang.String
match argument types (AnyRef)
       res0.f(x)
            ^

scala> new Y
res6: Y = Y@9ed91f

scala> res6.f(5)
res7: java.lang.String = 5
{code}

This problem was brought to my attention by Mockito's {{org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing}} interface, which overloads the method {{thenReturn}} to accept either an {{Object}}, or both an {{Object}} and a vararg of them.

> It's a potential implicit tuple conversion which makes the difference here. A single AnyRef can take all the other arguments as a tuple.

I ask this to be reviewed, please, as this doesn't match what is happening. For example:

{code}
scala> class X {
     |   def f(x: AnyRef) = x.toString
     |   def f(x: AnyRef, y: AnyRef*) = y.mkString(x.toString)
     | }
defined class X

scala>

scala> new X
res0: X = X@1cdc190

scala> val x : AnyRef = "a"
x: AnyRef = a

scala> res0.f(x, x)
res1: String = a
{code}

If {{(x, x)}} being converted into a tuple caused problems, then the above wouldn't have worked. However, not only it worked, but it choose the vargargs definition, indicating no tuple conversion happened.

The problem only happens when a *single* parameter is passed, so I fail to see why would any conversion to tuple come into play, or why would it matter in selecting the function even if it did.

If you pass a single parameter then both methods are applicable, and the compiler tries to find out which one is more specific. It will find that none of the two is more specific than the other, both are applicable to parameters of types of the other (once via tuple conversion). see spec for `more specific`.

When you pass two parameters, only the second one is applicable. (The first one would work through tuple conversion, but this is only tired when no other alternative works).

I assume that's a conversion into a Tuple1? Why would such a conversion be even considered, given that the type matches?

Sorry, let me try again.

{code}
object t {
  def f(x: AnyRef) = 1 // A
  def f(x: AnyRef, xs: AnyRef*) = 2 // B
}
{code}

if you call `f("foo")`, both A and B are applicable. Which one is more specific?

 * it is possible to call B with parameters of type `(AnyRef)`, so A is as specific as B.
 * it is possible to call A with parameters of type `(AnyRef, Seq[AnyRef])` thanks to tuple conversion, `Tuple2[AnyRef, Seq[AnyRef]]` conforms to `AnyRef`. So B is as specific as A.

Since both are as specific as the other, the reference to `f` is ambiguous.

Ok, it makes perfect sense now. If you don't mind, I'll reproduce your explanation on Stack Overflow, on a question related to this.

It is unfortunate, however, that this causes an interoperability problem with Java.

> it is possible to call A with parameters of type `(AnyRef, Seq[AnyRef])` thanks to tuple conversion, `Tuple2[AnyRef, Seq[AnyRef]]` conforms to `AnyRef`. So B is as specific as A.

It's wrong. The Scala Language Specification never said {{AnyRef*}} can be treated as {{Seq[AnyRef]}} when resolving overloaded methods.
Why is this closed as Not a Bug?

It causes serious interoperability issues with common Java libraries, and even JavaEE specifications. Look at the Configurable interface in JAX-RS 2.0:
https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/nonav/2.0/apidocs/javax/ws/rs/core/Configurable.html

It is not possible to invoke the one-arg register() method from Scala.

I just faced what I believe is the same problem in argparse4j setDefault. The argparse4s library single java file is a workaround for calling setDefault from scala:

https://github.com/mdekstrand/argparse4s/blob/master/src/main/java/net/elehack/argparse4s/ArgConfig.java

This is also the only reason I have java files in my codebase.


Verified that the test works OK in Dotty. Dotty still uses auto-tupling but not as pervasively as nsc. In particular, auto-tupling is done after overloading resulution. It's a last effort attempt if things do not work out without it.

Here's the test that compiles.

{code}
class X {
  def f(x: AnyRef) = x.toString
  def f(x: AnyRef, y: AnyRef*) = y.mkString(x.toString)
}

class Y {
  def f(x: Int) = x.toString
  def f(x: Int, y: Int*) = y.mkString(x.toString)
}

object Test {
  val x: AnyRef = "a"
  val res0 = new X
  res0.f(x)
  val res1 = new Y
  res1.f(5)
}
{code}
