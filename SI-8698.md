The build hasn't been working out of the box for a while, apparently because Maven artifacts have moved.

To reproduce, you'll need to clear your Maven local repository:

mv ~/.m2 ~/.m2_backup
git clone https://github.com/scala/scala.git test-scala
cd test-scala
git checkout 2.11.x
./pull-binary-libs.sh
ant build

Pull-binary works, but ant quickly yields errors (log attached), apparently it fails to downloads many artifacts (including scala-library) and gets some redirection HTML instead, which it stores in ~/.m2 !

For instance, `less /Users/ochafik/.m2/repository/org/scala-lang/scala-compiler/2.11.1/scala-compiler-2.11.1.jar` gives me:

<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.4.1</center>
</body>
</html>

This effectively prevents any fresh Scala build.
