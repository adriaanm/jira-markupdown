The offending bytecode instruction is:

{noformat}
   3:	lookupswitch{ //4
		97: 63;
		97: 56;
		98: 63;
		122: 56;
		default: 44 }
{noformat}

The list of int pair {{(match, offset)}} as per the JVMS "must be sorted in increasing numerical order by match." 

The problem above is the duplicate {{match}} value (97) which results from {{'a'}} matching two different case clauses (the second is unreachable for that value).

The backend can silently swallow duplicate {{match}} values but given they're constants, the error could be signalled earlier.
