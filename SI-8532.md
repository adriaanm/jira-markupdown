Reflection (e.g. using TypeTag) is not thread safe in Scala 2.10.x (see #6240). A fix has been released for Scala 2.11.0.

It has been suggested that this fix could be backported to 2.10. 
Some of the computationally intensive things in my code run in parallel and use reflection. I can't really seem to find a way around using reflection and I'm stuck with Scala 2.10 for the moment. I'm investigating how soon my dependencies can upgrade to 2.11, but until then, it's a problem. In #6240, others have wished for a back port but I'm not sure if the demand still exists.
