I have just tested Scala's JSR223 support by dropping the JAR http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/scala-lang/scala-compiler/2.11.5/scala-compiler-2.11.5.jar into my classpath and when the ScriptEngineManager iterates over all the ScriptEngineFactory providers, it fails for Scala with:

{noformat}
ScriptEngineManager providers.next(): javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory: Provider scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain$Factory could not be instantiated
{noformat}

Unfortunately there's no stack trace printed so I don't have the inner cause.

Note that this is the same error as the one raised in SI-7790 which was supposedly fixed in Scala Compiler 2.10.4-RC1

Thanks!
