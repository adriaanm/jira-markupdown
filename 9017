In 2.10.0 even with -Ywarn-adapted-args we had:

{noformat}
scala> (1, 2) == (1, 2)
res0: Boolean = true
{noformat}

but in 2.10.1-RC3 with -Ywarn-adapted-args we now get:

{noformat}
scala> (1, 2) == (1, 2)
<console>:8: warning: Adapting argument list by creating a 2-tuple: this may not be what you want.
        signature: Object.==(x$1: AnyRef): Boolean
  given arguments: 1, 2
 after adaptation: Object.==((1, 2): (Int, Int))
              (1, 2) == (1, 2)
                     ^
res0: Boolean = true
{noformat}

I'm guessing the change is the result of this fix.

Is there a drift towards making -Ywarn-adapted-args or -Yno-adapted-args the default? If so, this case might give us pause. Shouldn't comparing tuples with == be a perfectly fine thing to do?
