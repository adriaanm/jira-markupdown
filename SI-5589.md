The for-comprehension in the attempt method fails to compile, despite the fact that the nearly-equivalent desugared version works fine.

{noformat}
object Test extends App {
  def attempt(in: Int): Either[Int, (String, Int)] = in match {
    case 0 => Right("fubar", 13)
    
    case n => {
      val recLeft = attempt(math.abs(n) - 1)
      val recRight = attempt(-math.abs(n) + 1)
      
      // compiles!
      recLeft.right flatMap {
        case (strLeft, numLeft) => {
          recRight.right map {
            case (strRight, numRight) =>
              (strLeft + strRight, numLeft + numRight)
          }
        }
      }
      
      // doesn't compile!
      /* for {
        (strLeft, numLeft) <- recLeft.right
        (strRight, numRight) <- recRight.right
      } yield (strLeft + strRight, numLeft + numRight) */
    }
  }
  
  attempt(42)
  println("Nothing happens")
}
{noformat}

I'm guessing it has something to do with filter, since that's one thing that's missing from my desugared version.
Minimized.
{code}
class A {
  // First three compile.
  def f1(x: Either[Int, String])        = x.right map (y => y)
  def f2(x: Either[Int, String])        = for (y <- x.right) yield y
  def f3(x: Either[Int, (String, Int)]) = x.right map { case (y1, y2) => (y1, y2) }
  // Last one fails.
  def f4(x: Either[Int, (String, Int)]) = for ((y1, y2) <- x.right) yield ((y1, y2))
/**

  def f4(x: Either[Int, (String, Int)]) = for ((y1, y2) <- x.right) yield ((y1, y2))

  def f4(x: Either[Int, (String, Int)]) = for ((y1, y2) <- x.right) yield ((y1, y2))
                                                                                ^

}
{code}

See also SI-1336, to which this is related.  The unnecessary call to filter which it injects leads to Nothing being inferred for the type parameter to filter, which leads to typing failure.
