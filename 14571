The following code should not compile, but does:
```scala
trait X
trait A { def f: Option[X] }
object B {
    private class Y extends X { val y = 42 }
}
class B extends A {
    override def f = Some(new B.Y)
}
```
This piece of code contains a programming mistake which should be detected by the compile: the line
```scala
override def f = Some(new B.Y)
```
should instead read
```scala
override def f: Option[X] = Some(new B.Y)
```
because otherwise the result type will be inferred as Option[B.Y], revealing the private class Y through the public method f, so that any other module can access Y.y:
```scala
println((new B).f.get.y)  // prints 42
```
The error is correctly detected if object B is private or Y is a member of class B.
