(In r22755) closes SI-3663. disregard package nesting for access check of java syms

namers wasn't setting privateWithin on java-defined variables (btw, shouldn't clone carry over privateWithin?)
better treatment of linked class access boundary (only check for access within linked class if it actually exists)

would have liked more control for the test case: only javac should compile the java file, then scalac should compile the scala file and fail
