Hi. To me it seems that a special case of nested Annotations is still not working. It happens when a Scala annotation (i.e. a StaticAnnotation) contains a Java annotation, which contains named arguments (any annotation with more than one "value" argument)
{code}
class NestedAnnotationTest {
        // all of these work
	@ComplexJavaAnnotation(nested= new NestedJavaAnnotation2(arg="test"))
	@ComplexScalaAnnotation1(arg1=42, arg2="test")
	@ComplexScalaAnnotation2(nested = new NestedJavaAnnotation1(23))
	// this one throws "too many arguments for constructor NestedJavaAnnotation2"
        @ComplexScalaAnnotation2(nested = new NestedJavaAnnotation2(arg="test"))
	val field:int = 3;
}
{code}
Of course, NestedJavaAnnotation2 just looks like this
{code}
public @interface NestedJavaAnnotation2 {
	public String arg();
}
{code}

I tried to implement the TargetedAnnotation from SI-1846, but for this I need to put complex java annotations inside a scala annotation.
