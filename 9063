When it's there, we can rewrite it, well, I actually doubt it will come. Also when the closures don't cost anything, we can simplify the code which tests/creates/resets the thread-local - I believe this will happen much sooner than the first thing.

Thanks! I'll try to do that during the weekend. Of course if there is pressure, please do that now.
