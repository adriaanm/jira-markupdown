ScalaTest has very thorough Scaladoc documentation that includes much HTML markup. The latest Scaladoc strips out all this HTML formatting, which makes the resulting documentation very difficult to read.

I will attach a file that shows the problem. Just say:

scaladoc ScaladocExample.scala

Prior to 2.8.0.RC1, this will give you nicely formatted documentation. After 2.8.0.RC1, including 2.8.0.RC2, you get unformatted text.
(In r21945) [scaladoc] Closes #3428 (HTML markup supported in Scaladoc). Improves wiki-syntax parsing of lists. Improves stylesheet for headings and code blocks in comments. Review by malayeri.
May I attract the attention of those who have been following this bug (and who may be interested in the topic) to the following note on [wiki:Scaladoc/AuthorDocs Scaladoc's documentation for authors page]:

> HTML element tags are not recommended in Scaladoc, but are supported to maintain compatibility with existing documentation or when the wiki syntax is insufficient. If you are using HTML element tags in your documentation, you must be aware of the following.

> The following block-level HTML elements are sanitised by Scaladoc, which internally converts them into equivalent wiki syntax: `div`, `ol`, `ul`, `li`, `p` and all headings. A sanitised element will loose its attributes. Other block-level elements (`pre`, `table`, etc.) are not sanitised. However, a comment that starts with a non-sanitised block-level element may not be rendered correctly; make sure to have a least one paragraph, heading, or similar block before it.

> For an HTML element in a comment to be preserved as such in the documentation page, it must be recognised as valid. The following elements are recognised (in addition to the sanitised elements above):
> `a`, `abbr`, `acronym`, `address`, `area`, `b`, `bdo`, `big`, `blockquote`, `br`, `button`, `caption`, `code`, `cite`, `col`, `colgroup`, `dd`, `del`, `dfn`, `em`, `fieldset`, `form`, `hr`, `img`, `input`, `i`, `ins`, `kbd`, `label`, `legend`, `link`, `map`, `object`, `optgroup`, `option`, `param`, `pre`, `q`, `samp`, `select`, `small`, `span`, `strong`, `sub`, `sup`, `table`, `tbody`, `td`, `textarea`, `tfoot`, `th`, `thead`, `tr`, `tt`, `var`.
> Any other HTML/XML element will be encoded so as to be visibly printed in the documentation.

> In a wiki-syntax code block (using `{{`), all HTML/XML elements will be encoded so as to be visibly printed in the documentation, including the *recognised* elements above. They will not function as markup elements. However, if a code block is defined using the `pre` element, recognised elements inside the block will be preserved.

> Keep in mind that you rely on the documentation being generated in HTML, with a specific stylesheet. Scaladoc has an extensible documentation generator so that other formats may one day be generated. For this reason, recognised but non-sanitised HTML elements are not guaranteed to be kept by all generators. If you want to use HTML elements in your comment, we recommend you do not rely on them to obtain readable documentation, but instead use them for non-critial improvements.
