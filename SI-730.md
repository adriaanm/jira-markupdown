so I could write List(1,2,3).max instead of Iterable.max(List(1,2,3))

after all, max is just a special case of reduceLeft, and reduceLeft is a normal method on Iterable.
`min` and `max` make sense only for `Ordered` elements. Currently there is no straight way to express this type constraint inside the trait. Have a look at how these methods are defined inside the object:

```scala
  def min[A <% Ordered[A]](seq: Iterable[A]): A 
```

It would make sense to move them, when (if ever) Scala gets type constraints a la C#. Or maybe someone finds a clever way to code this using implicits..

could it be as simple as this?
```scala
def max[A](Iterable[A])(implicit f : A => Ordered[A]): A = ...
```

an existing example of this technique in the standard library is this, from List.scala:
```scala
  def flatten[B](implicit f : A => Iterable[B]) : List[B] = ...
```
Your code does not compile. Do you mean:

```scala
trait Iterable [A] {
  def max[A](implicit f : A => Ordered[A]): A = ...
..
}
```
? It looks like it should work, I haven't tried it yet..
yes, sorry, that's what I meant.

This is implemented as described here in the new collections, and Iterable.{min/max} are deprecated:
```scala
scala> scalax.collection.Sequence.empty ++ scalax.collection.Iterator.range(0,10)  
res0: scalax.collection.Sequence[Int] = List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

scala> res0.max
<console>:6: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Ordering[Int] was found.
       res0.max
       ^
```
...with the small caveat that there are no Ordering implementations for the standard types.  Fortunately there's a ticket open for that, so let's see about promoting #1303.
