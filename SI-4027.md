= problem =
The method TreeMap.mapValues transforms the TreeMap into a Map, therefore losing the order of keys in the original TreeMap. Additional copying of the returned Map into a new TreeMap is required to get the key order back again.

= analysis =
The present behaviour is inconsistent with the design of the rest of the library, e.g. the method map on the other kinds of collections usually returns the same type of collection it has been called on. There is no reason mapValues returned a Map of different kind, because it maps only the values, not the keys. Additionally, producing a TreeMap of an identical structure as the existing TreeMap should be faster than creating a new Map from scratch (which would require hashing or comparing the keys). 

= enhancement recommendation =
Make the TreeMap.mapValues return a TreeMap object.

(And probably: make the HashMap.mapValues return a HashMap object, although it is not as important for the users, because HashMap has a weaker contract than TreeMap).
The `mapValues` creates a wrapper around the underlying map, so the result has the type `Map`. Making the result type `TreeMap` would be messy, since the `TreeMap` is not a wrapper. However, even though the result type is `Map`, it's not true that the order is lost.

Can you please post a code snippet that demonstrates the described behaviour?

{code}

All the examples before the last line show that the order is preserved. The last line, however, shows that the REPL does some kind of mapping before printing the map. Because type information is lost by `mapValues`, the subsequent `map` operation triggers the more general implicit builder factory - the one for `Map`s, which defaults to hash maps.

Perhaps this is what you've meant?
