Sometime since 2.10.1 this little devil has snuck in. How is it that we have no test which covers this... if you compile the crasher file with other files, it may not crash (that's how.) Right now if you try with 2.10.x to compile scala/collection/mutable/ArrayOps.scala all by itself, it will crash; but compile the entire library, and you're okay.
