swing.ListView lacks a property corresponding to peer.set/getVisibleRowCount. this property is needed when placing the view inside a ScrollPane for the pane to determine its preferred size.

It also lacks `ensureIndexIsVisible` which is equally important.
(imaier in [r25497|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25497]) Added some missing methods to ListView. Closes #4799.
