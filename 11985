The behaviour is actually correct (unless I'm missing something). You'd get the same behaviour if you were to use just the `java.util.regex.Pattern/Matcher` classes (which are wrapped by the Scala classes anyway).
The `.*` means any character (including empty string) any number of times (including zero).
If you wanted the empty string out of the result list you could use `.+` instead.
