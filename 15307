This bug was introduced in Scala 2.8.0RC2. In a Scala project if we define a Java annotation with default values and try to compile we get the following message: "not found: type _root_".

An annotation like the following produces the above compilation error

{code}
public @interface MyAnnotation {

  String name() default "spiros";
}
{code}

This bug is really important since the only reason a Scala programmer has to write Java is for defining annotations. Many of the mixed Scala/Java projects contain annotations and this bug prevents any development in those projects.
