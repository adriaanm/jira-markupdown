The humble "String.replaceAll()" method, available in the "String" type via the StringOps type and implemented in the JDK, lacks documentation in Scaladocs. A new Scala programmer will have a devil of a time finding (1) where the "String" type scaladocs are located and (2) once on the "StringOps" page where the docs for replaceAll() are located.
I wonder if Predef.String should get a page to carry the doc for implicits.
