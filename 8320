Not a bug.  "toTry" takes a current "Catch[T]" result and converts it to a "Catch[Try[T]]".  You want to either do:
```scala
for(n <- 0 to 3) {
  val result = allToss withTry toss(n)
  println(result + ": " + showClass(result))
}
```

Where `withTry` is the appropriate method to call instead of `opt` or `either`.

**or**
```scala
for(n <- 0 to 3) {
  val result = allToss toTry Success(toss(n))
  println(result + ": " + showClass(result))
}
```

Where `toTry` turns the exception handler to expect you to try to generate a type of 'Try[T]' and it will catch exceptions.  You use `Success` here instead of `Try` because you don't want Try to catch the exceptions.



Also:  .getSimpleName  using Java Reflection is fraught with peril.  Java hardcodes notions about class names that aren't enforced by the JVM, so sometimes Scala's encoding of traits or anonymous functions causes getSimpleName to explode.
