Update: [~aurel.paulovic] can you confirm that this is fixed on the latest build from the 2.12.x branch?

[~moors] just merged my fix (https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/198c201590d8ab25b0474bf68266714a7542a37d) to SI-8990. As you can see in the linked fix, `Stream#withFilter` is now essentially little more than a delayed call to `Stream#filter`, so my expectation is that this issue will have been fixed.
