as I understand it, the fix for this is simple: don't give interpreter wrappers blingy names (might I suggest replacing $$ by CHF?)

we don't officially deal in dollars anyway (at least not in user-supplied names)

Paul, I'm sorry I can't provide more insight on the use of the dollar in generated names, but I think we can settle for a pragmatic solution here. Could the deeper problem simply be that calling this class `$$anon` triggers a conversion that's not meant to be done in here?  

{code}
    val ANON_CLASS_NAME: NameType    = "$$anon"
[...]
    final def isAnonymousClass    = isClass && (name containsName tpnme.ANON_CLASS_NAME)
{code}
