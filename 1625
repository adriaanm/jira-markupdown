While looking at scala/bug#8217, I could actually find the rule in the spec in 5.1: "If the template forms part of a concrete class definition, stats may still contain declarations of abstract type members, but not of abstract term members."

However, this does not describe why it is forbidden to have:
```scala
object Baz { type T }
```
See scala/bug#8217 for that.
