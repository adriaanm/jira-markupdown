At the moment quasiquotes don't persist comments in ASTs due to the fact that they are stripped out during parsing:
{code}
scala> q"""
     | /*foo bar*/
     | def baz = 2
     | """
res0: reflect.runtime.universe.DefDef = def baz = 2

scala> res0.sr
res1: String = DefDef(Modifiers(), TermName("baz"), List(), List(), TypeTree(), Literal(Constant(2)))
{code}
