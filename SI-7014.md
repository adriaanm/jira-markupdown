With Scalac 2.10, the use of any objects, class or method annotaded with the com.unboundid.util.ThreadSafetyLevel leads to java.lang.AssertionError.

For example, the following file Test.scala:
{code}
import com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Entry

object Test extends App {
  
  val foo = new Entry("plop")
  
}
{code}

Leads to :
{code}
% scalac -classpath ./lib/unboundid-ldapsdk-2.3.1.jar src/Test.scala
warning: Caught: java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed:

That seems to be linked to the following comment: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/symtab/classfile/ClassfileParser.scala#L1033

// We want to be robust when annotations are unavailable, so the very least
// we can do is warn the user about the exception
// There was a reference to ticket 1135, but that is outdated: a reference to a class not on
// the classpath would *not* end up here. A class not found is signaled
// with a `FatalError` exception, handled above. Here you'd end up after a NPE (for example),
// and that should never be swallowed silently.

I just got eaten with the update to Scala-IDE 3.0.1 which uses Scala 2.10.2, and so is not usable on our project. 
So, that bug is starting to be *really* annoying. 

All in all, I prefered the past behaviour, with hundreds of assert error lines in the log. Our build output were crap, but actually could build the project...

    WIP SI-7551 Ignore class file parser cycles in annotations

    But should we be parsing runtime visible annotations other than
    ScalaSignature at all?
