If those are the only objections then please see the one-line patch proposed in SI-8223 (dealias more in InstantiateDependentMap) and the one here (dealias more in AsSeenFromMap.) Obviously this points toward "dealias more in TypeMap" as a possible one-patch-solves-all sort of thing. But I know that cycles will be a problem.
