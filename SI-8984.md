The following code compiles but throws an exception at runtime:
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate field name&signature in class file Test$C$2

{code}
object Test extends App {
  
  test()
  
  def test () {
    
    val a = 42
    
    trait T {
      def f { a }
    }
    
    case class C () extends T
    
    C()
    
  }
  
}
{code}
In 2.12.0-RC1, there's a compile-time error: {{error: parameter 'a$1' requires field but conflicts with value a$1 in trait T$1}}

Possibly a duplicate of https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5252, at least related.
Seems to me we could just close this as a duplicate of SI-5252, though it's valuable to have the additional test case.
