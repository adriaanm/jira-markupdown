The length and size methods on ListBuffer differ. The former is overridden in ListBuffer.scala to have an O(1) implementation, but the latter forwards to "underlying", which uses the O(n ) implementation from TraversableOnce.

To reproduce,

```scala
def time[A](f: => A): A = {
  val t1 = System.currentTimeMillis
  val ret = f
  val t2 = System.currentTimeMillis
  println("%g secs".format((t2 - t1)/1000.))
  ret
}

val lb = collection.mutable.ListBuffer.tabulate[Int](1000*1000)(identity)

time(for (j <- 0 until 10000) { lb.length })
time(for (j <- 0 until 10000) { lb.size })
```

I get,

```scala
scala> time(for (j <- 0 until 1000) { lb.length })
0.00000 secs

scala> time(for (j <- 0 until 1000) { lb.size })
5.48300 secs
```

The issue came up on StackOverflow, where Daniel Sobral explained the behavior,

It would also be nice to update the ScalaDoc for `ListBuffer.length` and `size` with performance characteristics.
(extempore in [r25684](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25684)) ListBuffer.size should be O(1).

Not O(n) like it was.  Here's another good candidate for some
mythical performance regression tests.  Closes #4933, no review.
