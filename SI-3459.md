Or if not an API per se, at least I can define a few useful general purpose functions which we can try to avoid gratuitously changing.  Assigning to myself, enclosing an email with some specifics from one user.

Paul, do you have some time to look at my "problem" ? it's not really a
problem...it's just that every time the parser changes, I have to update my
"hacked" version and that's annoying - it's only like 20 lines... If you
could incorporate that access into the actual parsers?

I created a simple stand-alone example for the 5 use cases, out of which 4
work fine. Once you update the parser, I will clean this up and make it
generally available and when anyone asks this question again, we'll just
point to it.

Here is my "hacked" parser

http://github.com/razie/scripster/blob/master/src/scala/tools/nsc/Interpreter.
scala
   
I needed access to some internals, so the hack consists of this section:
   
   
// BEGIN RAZ hacks

   // 1. Request is private. I need: dependencies (usedNames?) newly defined
values (boundNames?)
   // the resulting value and the error message(s) if any
   case class RazRequest (usedNames : List[String], boundNames:List[String],
extractionValue:Option[Any], err:List[String])

   // 2. Can't get the last request
   def razLastReq : RazRequest = {
      val l =  prevRequests.last
      RazRequest (l.usedNames.map(_.decode), l.boundNames.map(_.decode),
l.extractionValue, razAccerr.toList)
   }                                                                            
    
   // 3. Can't get the actual error message
   var razAccerr = new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[String] ()
      
  /** reporter */
  object reporter extends ConsoleReporter(settings, null, out) {
    override def printMessage(msg: String) {
      razAccerr append msg
      out println clean(msg)
      out.flush()
    }                                                                           
  }
