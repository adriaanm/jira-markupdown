There appears to be a problem with the auto-indentation with case statements which are preceeded by a case statement with a block:

{code}
	def update(objectPtr : Int, f : String, v : Any) : Boolean = {
	  map.get(objectPtr) match {
	    case Some(obj) => {
	      obj(f) = v
          true
	    }
     case None => false    // <--- note incorrect indentation
	  }
	}
{code}

Note that this auto-indentation occurred when I hit <tab> while the cursor was to the left of the statement.
