Hi,

Is there anything I can do to help get this bug fixed?

I have a project (https://github.com/jedesah/scala-codesheet-api if your curious) which has just under 100 tests and almost all of them will fail with unpositioned trees.

Having to use a custom version of Scala is giving me trouble in regard to integrating my evaluation engine into my Play! webapp. For what it's worth in regard to Paul's questions, I patched the compiler by removing the assert in setPos and therefore the guard against emptyValDef because that makes the most sense to me.

While we're at it. Once the patch is applied the lines of the positions are off by one. I believe this is due to the Wrapper Object that is added in order to support compiling standalone expressions. I just handle it in my client code but it would probably be nicer to fix this internally.

Like I said is there anything I can do to help advance this issue. I would be very happy if this could be fixed as part of the next stable release of the 2.10.x branch.

Thx for your time
