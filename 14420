using the 2.8 nightly eclipse plugin, F3 doesn't work in scala source code. I get an erorr window with this text:
Problems opening an editor.
assertion failed: bad position: [1013:1012]

the second number above is always the first -1...

Reproduce:
1. open a scala file
2. click on a class name
3. press F3 OR right-click and choose "Open Declaration"
