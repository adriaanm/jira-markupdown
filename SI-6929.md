In https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/649c2784 I modified lub not to accidentally lub its way to T* types, and included this comment:
{code}
-      existentialAbstraction(tparams, lubType)
+      // dropRepeatedParamType is a localized fix for SI-6897. We should probably
+      // integrate that transformation at a lower level in master, but lubs are
+      // the likely and maybe only spot they escape, so fixing here for 2.10.1.
+      existentialAbstraction(tparams, dropRepeatedParamType(lubType))
{code}
