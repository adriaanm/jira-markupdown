I would expect the following to return true
{code}
 val n = <a xmlns=""/>
 n.namespace == null
{code}

Instead I get :
{code}
 type mismatch;
 found   : object Nil
 required: String
       <a xmlns=""/>
{code}
The problem has nothing to do with projecting the namespace.  Just writing
{code}
val n = <a xmlns=""/>
{code}
will cause the failure.

I can't seem to find the XML maintainer in the users list.  Does anyone if he even has an account?
From the file header of class `scala.xml.NamespaceBinding` one can read:
{code}
/** The class <code>NamespaceBinding</code> represents namespace bindings
 *  and scopes. The binding for the default namespace is treated as a null
 *  prefix. the absent namespace is represented with the null uri. Neither
 *  prefix nor uri may be empty, which is not checked.
 *
 *  @author  Burak Emir
 *  @version 1.0
 */
{code}
That means that with the current implementation of `NamespaceBinding` the uri may not be empty *and* is not checked.

Okay, but to my knowledge this is valid XML, so it probably should work by default.

Where did I write that projecting the namespace would cause the failure ?

I'm just saying that the XML parser should understand standard XML, so I can express this in scala :
{code}
<root xmlns="root-ns">
    <noNsElement xmlns=""/>
</root>
{code}

More over I would expect the following :
{code}
   val n = <a xmlns=""/>
   n.toString == """<a xmlns=""></a>"""
{code}

Cause at the moment I find this quite ugly :
{code}
  val n = xml.XML.loadString("""<a xmlns=""/>""")
  n.toString == """<a xmlns="null"></a>"""
{code}

returns true ...
This is also interesting :
{code}
xml.XML.loadString("""<a xmlns="cool"><b xmlns=""/></a>""").child.first.toString
{code}

returns 
{code}
<b xmlns="null" xmlns="cool"></b>
{code}
As a workaround for those who need empty namespaces to be converted correctly to string, i've created this printer. It's far from good. It doesn't handle comments and stuff, just element and atom nodes. Here are some unit tests :
{code}
import org.testng.annotations.Test
import org.testng.Assert._

class EmptyNullNamespacePrinterTest { 
	val printer = new EmptyNullNamespacePrinter
	
	@Test
	def shouldPrintTextNodeAsString {
		testXmlStringConversion( """<aNode xmlns="a-ns">Hello<b>Inside B</b> from scala</aNode>""" )
	}	
	
	@Test
	def shouldPrintEmptyNamespaceEmpty {
		testXmlStringConversion( """<aNode xmlns="a-ns">Hello<b xmlns="">Inside B<c></c></b> from scala</aNode>""" )
	}
	
	@Test
	def shouldPrintPCDataNodeAsString {
		val s = "a-string"
		val r = printer.print( <a>{ s }</a> )
		assertEquals( r, "<a>a-string</a>" )
	}

	protected def testXmlStringConversion( xmlString : String ) {
		val r = printer.print( scala.xml.XML.loadString( xmlString ) )
		assertEquals( r, xmlString )
	}
}
{code}
