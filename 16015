=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
build file with scaladoc

/**
 * Subclass of <code>org.jmock.Expectations</code> that provides <code>withArg</code>
 * alternatives to the <code>with</code> methods defined in its superclass.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>JMockCycle</code>'s <code>expecting</code> method of passes an instance of this class
 * to the function passed into <code>expectations</code>. Because <code>JMockExpectations</code>
 * extends <code>org.jmock.Expectations</code>, all of the <code>Expectations</code> methods are
 * available to be invoked on instances of this class, in addition to
 * several overloaded <code>withArg</code> methods defined in this class. These <code>withArg</code> methods simply
 * invoke corresponding <code>with</code> methods on <code>this</code>. Because <code>with</code> is
 * a keyword in Scala, to invoke these directly you must surround them in back ticks, like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * oneOf (mockCollaborator).documentAdded(`with`("Document"))
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * By importing the members of the <code>JMockExpectations</code> object passed to
 * a <code>JMockCycle</code>'s <code>executing</code> method, you can
 * instead call <code>withArg</code> with no back ticks needed:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * oneOf (mockCollaborator).documentAdded(withArg("Document"))
 * </pre>

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

fully qualified name:

org.hamcrest.Matcher

=== What do you see instead? ===

Matcher

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

In JMockSugar. some of the methods take a Matcher, but it just says
Matcher. Well that's a org.hamcrest.Matcher, not a
org.scalatest.Matcher, and there's no way to tell from the
documentation
