The following compiles in 2.10.1, but not in 2.10.2-RC1.  This has a straightforward workaround (see comments) and is not urgent.

{code:lang=java}
trait Box[ K[A[x]] ]

object Box {
   // type constructor composition
   sealed trait ∙[A[_], B[_]] { type l[T] = A[B[T]] }

   // composes type constructors inside K
   type SplitBox[K[A[x]], B[x]] = Box[ ({ type l[A[x]] = K[ (A ∙ B)#l] })#l ]

   def split[ K[A[x]], B[x] ](base: Box[K]): SplitBox[K,B] = ???

   class Composed[B[_], K[A[x]] ] {
      val box: Box[K] = ???

      type Split[ A[x] ] = K[ (A ∙ B)#l ]
      val a: Box[Split] = Box.split(box)

      //Either of these work:
      //val a: Box[Split] = Box.split[K,B](box)
      //val a: Box[ ({ type l[A[x]] = K[ (A ∙ B)#l ] })#l ] = Box.split(box)
   }
}
```scala

Error:
```

Note: K >: K with Composed.this.Split, but trait Box is invariant in type K.
You may wish to define K as -K instead. (SLS 4.5)

Ha, look at paulp calling it in #7226. "and it's not a risk-free fix"

Of course one can usually take that position without extending one's neck too far (with the compiler, one always can) and yet, somehow it has the air of true prophecy.
It compiles both before and after 0cde930b . The point between 2.9 and 2.10 when it started working was 658ba1b4e6, which makes sense given the test case:
```scala
// test/files/pos/hkrange.scala
class A {
  def f[CC[X] <: Traversable[X]](x: CC[Int]) = ()
  
  f(1 to 5)
}
```
```

     Fixed adriaan's patch for type constructor inference. The problem with
     haranguing people in bars about bugs is that the fixes with which they
     provide you may be flawed. Fortunately moors has this novelist on
     retainer. Review by moors.
```
One more data point: Applying 7e52fb910b immediately after 0cde930b compiles the test case successfully. Another change also appears to be in play.
The actual regression (or progression, perhaps), comes from the use of `dealiasWidenChain` in `unifyFull`.

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/e5da30b843#L5L3176

```scala
// old
tpes = List(Composed.this.Split[A], K[[T]A[B[T]]])

//new 
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(Composed.this.Split[A], K[[T]A[B[T]]])
```
This fixes it:
```scala
 -        tpe.dealiasWidenChain exists unifySpecific
 +        val tpes = if (isLowerBound) tpe.dealiasWidenChain else tpe :: Nil
 +        tpes exists unifySpecific
```
But, unsurprisingly, breaks other things.

Sorry, I pasted the wrong snippet.

Here are all of the before/after pairs. I'm not sure about the difference between the first and second attempt to do the old ad-hoc version of `dealiasWidenChain` for ` Composed.this.Split[A] `.

```

tpes = List(Composed.this.Split[A], K[[T]A[B[T]]])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(Composed.this.Split[A], K[[T]A[B[T]]])

tpes = List(T)
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(T)
tpes = List(Any)
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(Any)
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])

tpes = List(Composed.this.Split[A])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(Composed.this.Split[A], K[[T]A[B[T]]])

tpes = List(x)
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(x)
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
tpes = List(B[T])
tpe.dealiasWidenChain.toList = List(B[T])
```
Here's another idea.

```scala
-addBound(tp.typeConstructor)
-isSubArgs(lhs, rhs, params, AnyDepth)
+isSubArgs(lhs, rhs, params, AnyDepth) && {addBound(tp.typeConstructor); true}
```

With this patch, both this test and t6846.scala compile. A quick run of `pt --pos --neg` is also green.

What I'm trying to avoid, is registering both type constructors `K` and `Split` as bounds, which leads to them later being glb-ed in a seemingly nonsensical way. (What does `RefinementType(parents = K, Split)` mean, anyway?)
Oh, and we should stay open to the idea of a conservative partial-revert for 2.10.2; leaving the a progression for 2.11.x. I'm not quite sure how that would play out as #6846 itself fixed a regression.

I suppose it would be good to try to construct a simpler test that exhibits the same problem to gauge where this lands on the esoteric-o-meter.

Paul, perhaps could you discuss this one with Adriaan?
