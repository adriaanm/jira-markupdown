You probably shouldn't be using straight val's in Test (at least not in the trait).

try this in the repl:

trait Test {
 val x = {println("x"); new Test { override def toString = "trait Test" }}
}
object Test {
 val y = {println("y"); new Test { override def toString = "object Test" }}
}
Test.y

turning them into lazy vals will fix this
