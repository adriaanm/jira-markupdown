As described in http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals/browse_thread/thread/eabcf3d406dab8b2, lubResults/glbResults are leaking. These guys are cleaned up by lub/glb, but they are also used in private methods like "def lub(ts: List[Type], depth: Int): Type", which don't clean the caches.
Since 2.11.0-RC1 is one week away, pushing all non-blockers without PR to 2.11.1-RC1. Please undo the change if I missed work in progress.
