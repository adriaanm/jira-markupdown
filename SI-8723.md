 - when disambiguating between members the singatures should be post-processed to enable copy-paste:

{code}
Link.scala:22: warning: The link target "scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext$.fromExecutor(e:java\.util\.concurrent\.Executor*" is ambiguous. Several members fit the target:
(e: java.util.concurrent.Executor,reporter: Throwable => Unit): scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor in object ExecutionContext [chosen]
(e: java.util.concurrent.Executor): scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor in object ExecutionContext
{code}

Instead, the signatures should be:


{code}
[[fromExecutor(e:java\.util\.concurrent\.Executor,reporter:Throwable=>Unit): scala\.concurrent\.ExecutionContextExecutor]] in object ExecutionContext [chosen]
[[fromExecutor(e:java\.util\.concurrent\.Executor):scala\.concurrent\.ExecutionContextExecutor]] in object ExecutionContext
{code}

Steps necessary:
 * escape dots and hashes
 * remove whitespaces
 * add the (full) path before

Another problem: in the crash course, escaping is incorrect:

{code}
Notes:
 - you can use any number of matching square brackets to avoid interference with the signature
 - you can use \\. to escape dots in prefixes (don't forget to use * at the end to match the signature!)
 - you can use \\# to escape hashes, otherwise they will be considered as delimiters, like dots.
{code}

We need:
 * example for the first item
 * {{\\.}} should be {{\.}}
 * {{\\#}} should be {{\#}}
