on trunk as of r18368:
{code}
scala> Stream.from(1).take(5).mkString 
res12: String = 1?
{code}

doh!
This looks like it was intended as a feature, and is in the documentation (unfortunately the docs for addString, not mkString.) It's not obvious to me which way is better, but you can force lazy and you can't lazify forced.
{code}
  /** Write all defined elements of this iterable into given string builder.
   *  The written text begins with the string <code>start</code> and is finished by the string
   *  <code>end</code>. Inside, the string representations of defined elements (w.r.t.
   *  the method <code>toString()</code>) are separated by the string
   *  <code>sep</code>. The method will not force evaluation of undefined elements. A
   *  tail of such elements will be represented by a "?" instead.
   */
{code}
Paul,

I think you may be mistaken that this was an intentional change.

The reason addString behaves that way is to support this behavior of toString which is the same in both 2.7.5 and trunk:
{code}
scala> Stream.from(1).toString
res1: String = Stream(1, ?)
{code}

were you aware of this when you closed the ticket...?

I really think the new behavior of mkString is nonsensical. It's good for toString not to force, because toString is used during debugging, in the REPL, etc. But if I use mkString, I am explicitly saying I want to build a string out of the contents of the stream.
