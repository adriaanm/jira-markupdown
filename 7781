Injecting my comment from the scala-internals thread because it seems plausibly among the least bad ways to go from here.

Hmm, maybe we should let people declare the copy signature they want, and accommodate it if possible.

case class C(x: Int)(y: Int)(implicit z: Int) {
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int = y): C  // this way z is fixed at construction, and gets a field
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int = y)(implicit z: Int = z): C // this way z is an optional implicit, and gets a field
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int = y)(implicit z: Int): C // this way z is a mandatory implicit, no field
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int)(implicit z: Int): C // and this way neither y nor z gets a field
}
