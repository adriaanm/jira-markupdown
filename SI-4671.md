Scala2.9 REPL scala.io.Source
It becomes a false result if it divides into two lines when it is one line though it is correct.

//OK
scala> val s = scala.io.Source.fromFile("C:/a.txt"); val r = s.getLines.toList
s: scala.io.BufferedSource = empty iterator
r: List[String] = List(aaa, aa)

//NG
scala> val s = scala.io.Source.fromFile("C:/a.txt")
s: scala.io.BufferedSource = non-empty iterator

scala> val r = s.getLines.toList
r: List[String] = List()


Scala2.8.1 is OK.
Duplicate of #4662.

For your information, the problem is that REPL printed the iterator `s`, which makes `getLines` return empty. Work-around: don't print a `BufferedSource` before calling `getLines` on it.
Closely related to #1655, only deferring lazy behavior in this case would be damn near impossible.
(extempore in [r25212](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25212)) Keep BufferedSource from losing buffered data when a derivative iterator
is created via getLines.  Closes #4671, #4662, no review.
