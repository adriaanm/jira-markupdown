In

{code}
trait A {
  val x: Int
}

trait B extends A {
  val x = "Hello"
}
{code}

the error message is

{quote}
overriding value x in trait A of type Int;
 value x has incompatible type      ^
{quote}

By analogy with the error message when a def is involved rather than a val, a clearer error message would be:

{quote}
type mismatch;
 found   : String("Hello")
 required: Int
{quote}
