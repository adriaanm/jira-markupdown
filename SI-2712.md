implement what's described in "Partial polymorphic type inference and higher-order unification"

{code}
object Test {
  def meh[M[_], A](x: M[A]): M[A] = x
  meh{(x: Int) => x} // should solve ?M = [X] X => X and ?A = Int ... 
}
{code}
With dependent method types we have a somewhat cumbersome, but just about usable workaround. The key idea is to use implicits to destructure a type, and then pick out and use its component parts as dependent types.

{code}
// Template we will unpack into
trait UnpackM[MA] {
  type M[_]
  type A
}
  
// Destructuring implicits
implicit def unpackM1[M0[_], A0] = new UnpackM[M0[A0]] {
  type M[X] = M0[X]
  type A = A0
}

implicit def unpackM2[M0[_, _], A0, B0] = new UnpackM[M0[A0, B0]] {
  type M[X] = M0[A0, X]
  type A = B0
}

def meh[MA](x : MA)(implicit u : UnpackM[MA]) : (u.M[String], List[u.A]) = null
//      ^^          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^       ^^^
//      (1)                   (2)                    (3)           (3)
// 1: Type variable being destructured
// 2: Destructuring implicit
// 3: Uses of (dependent) component types
  
val m = meh{(x: Int) => x}
implicitly[m.type <:< (Int => String, List[Int])]
{code}

See also [here|http://goo.gl/efy8F] for a slightly more elaborate scalaz inspired example.
See also SI-6744, where we would like to infer these sort of types in pattern matching.
Would it be any easier to just look for partial applications of existing type constructors in left-to-right order? Haskell does roughly this (actually, type constructors are just curried, see below), it is tractable, and people don't seem to have an issue with the limitation, though occasionally you do have to introduce a new type just to flip the order of some type parameters.

Here's an example:

{code}
case class State[S,A](run: S => (A,S))
object Blah {
  def foo[M[_],A](m: M[A]): M[A] = m
  ...
  val blah = foo(State((i: Int) => ("hi",i+1)))
}
{code}

Another way to think about this is that type constructors are curried, so State[S,A] is actually represented as Ap(Ap(State, S), A), and likewise the M[A] is Ap(freevar, A) - these unify with freevar = Ap(State, S).
To Paul's comment, I agree that looking at the type parameters as curried, partially applied from left to right (SI-4719) is probably usually good enough.

If {{State\[S, A\]}} has pseudo-Haskell-ish kind {{(\*, \*) -> \*}}, then {{State\[S\]\[A\]}} would have kind {{\* -> \* -> \*}}, and {{State\[S\]}} would have kind {{\* -> \*}}.
It seems somehow I never mentioned higher-order *pattern* unification by Miller, which is what Agda uses â€” the paper I linked ("Unification via explicit substitutions: The case of higher-order patterns") is indeed about that. For whatever reason, everybody steers away from the original Huet algorithm, including modern implementation of lambdaProlog (which is what "Partial Polymorphic Type Inference and Higher-Order Unification" uses).
