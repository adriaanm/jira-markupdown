It looks like even when there's no @ binding, the pattern matcher is helpfully noticing that the value on the rhs is the same as the one on the lhs.  No CCE since #1503, but not exactly a model of unbrokenness either.

```scala
scala> case object Bob { override def equals(other: Any) = true }
defined module Bob

scala> def f(x: Any) = x match { case Bob => Bob }
f: (x: Any)object Bob

scala> f(5)
res0: object Bob = null
```
(In r21923) Overhauled sequence length logic in the pattern matcher.  Removes
unnecessary boxing and a few varieties of wrongness.

Closes #3395, #3150, #2958, #2945, #2187.  No review.
