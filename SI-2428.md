Steps to reproduce:
 1. Create a class or object with the name BitSet
 2. Compile the class by saving the file (the BitSet.class file gets generated under the bin directory)
 3. Delete the BitSet code from the editor and save the file to re-compile

At this stage the BitSet.class file still exists under the bin directory.

The above inconsistency can be problematic in the following scenario: if after deleting the BitSet class we try to import _scala.collection.BitSet_ we get a warning saying _imported `BitSet' is permanently hidden by definition of class BitSet_ and to resolve this issue we have to do a clean before we build the project again.


Tested with:
 * Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r18866-b20091002031415
 * SUN JDK 1.6.0_16
 * Ubuntu Linux 9.04 x86_64
I've tested this with the latest snapshot and the file gets deleted but the bogus warning message appears again.

Please see SI-2443 for more information.
