The ScalaDoc is supposed to show the first sentence about a member as its summary. 2.11.2 fixed a bug where the first period found was treated as a sentence end (#8672). A similar bug still occurs with acronyms ending in a period, such as "i.e.".

The first line of Future.onSuccess shown is

bq. When this future is completed successfully (i.e.

It should show instead
bq. When this future is completed successfully (i.e. with a value), apply the provided partial function to the value if the partial function is defined at that value.
Actually, that's not an acronym, as my colleague would insist, and second:

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3918

recognizes that the parenthetical should be set off with a comma.

(Apparently, C.I.A. is an initialism and scuba and laser are acronyms.)

That means initialisms are disallowed in the first sentence, however.  Except at the end, of course; Y.M.M.V.
