You don't have to cast it.  All you have to do is
```scala
(d: C).b()
```
Hard to see what can be done about it, unless we follow through on treating java and scala members differently.  Java no-argument methods all have parens so fields have to be able to override () methods.  Personally I'm not convinced it represents a loss of type safety either -- something not compiling does not represent unsoundness.  I'll leave it for martin & co to determine though.
