```scala
assertEquals({ println("computing expected"); 1 }, { println("computing actual"); 2 })
```

prints:
```scala
computing expected
computing actual
computing actual
bebe failed due to failed assertion:(no message), expected: 1, actual: 2
```

Seems like parameters to assertEquals should be passed by value, not by name.
