Test case below. Uncommenting the line makes the test throw:

{quote}
scala.ScalaReflectionException: Scala field x  isn't represented as a Java field, neither it has a Java accessor method
note that private parameters of class constructors don't get mapped onto fields and/or accessors,
unless they are used outside of their declaring constructors.
{quote}

Test case:

{code}
class FieldAccessTest {

  class TestClass {
    private val x = 123
    // Uncomment the following line to make the test fail
    // () => x
  }

  @Test
  def testFieldAccess(): Unit = {
    import scala.reflect.runtime.{universe => ru}
    val mirror = ru.runtimeMirror(getClass.getClassLoader)

    val obj = new TestClass
    val objType = mirror.reflect(obj).symbol.toType
    val objFields = objType.members.collect { case ms: ru.MethodSymbol if ms.isGetter => ms }

    Assert.assertEquals(123, mirror.reflect(obj).reflectField(objFields.head).get)
  }
}
{code}

The problem appears to be caused by name mangling, which is triggered by the presence of the anonymous function. The field is then named "FieldAccessTest$TestClass$$x" instead of "x" in the resulting bytecode, which causes reflection to fail.
I'm testing with a 2.11.8 snapshot (7a950df664405ff9abe5068f70f6e2e6d586c541), and OpenJDK 1.8.0_66-internal-b01.

Without the {{() => x}}, {{javap}} gives:

{noformat}
public class scala.reflect.FieldAccessTest$TestClass {
  private final int x;
  ...
  private int x();
  ...
}
{noformat}

With it:

{noformat}
  private final int scala$reflect$FieldAccessTest$TestClass$$x;
  ...
  public int scala$reflect$FieldAccessTest$TestClass$$x();
{noformat}

{{JavaMirrors.fieldToJava()}} is called from {{reflectField()}}, and it calls {{jclazz getDeclaredField expandedName(fld)}} in line 1261:

{code}
def fieldToJava(fld: TermSymbol): jField = fieldCache.toJava(fld) {
  val jclazz = classToJava(fld.owner.asClass)
  val jname = fld.name.dropLocal.toString
  try jclazz getDeclaredField jname
  catch {
    case ex: NoSuchFieldException => jclazz getDeclaredField expandedName(fld)
  }
}
{code}

Inside {{Class.getDeclaredField()}}, {{Class.searchFields()}} is called and fails to match the expanded name {{scala$reflect$FieldAccessTest$TestClass$$x}} to the interned name on line 2958:

{code}
private static Field searchFields(Field[] fields, String name) {
    String internedName = name.intern();
    for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) {
        if (fields[i].getName() == internedName) {
            return getReflectionFactory().copyField(fields[i]);
        }
    }
    return null;
}
{code}

Which leads me to believe that the expanded names are not being interned.
The error these days is:

{noformat}
scala.ScalaReflectionException: Scala field x  of class TestClass isn't represented as a Java field, nor does it have a
Java accessor method. One common reason for this is that it may be a private class parameter
not used outside the primary constructor.
{noformat}
Same issue here impeding `scala.pickling` to serialise object due transient private field.
{code:java}
trait Logging {
  @transient private var log_ : Logger = null

  // ...
}
{code}


I'm getting the same error while unpickling a case class with some {{private val}} s. I'm getting the error for only one of the fields even though there are other private and non-private {{val}} s of the same type ( {{Map[Int, Double]}} ). I tried changing the order of declaration of the fields in the class, changed the order of pickling the fields, still the same field causes the failure:
{code:shell}
scala.ScalaReflectionException: Scala field currentMean  isn't represented as a Java field, neither it has a Java accessor method
note that private parameters of class constructors don't get mapped onto fields and/or accessors,
unless they are used outside of their declaring constructors.
