Hi @SethTisue,

I understand that "this is a fundamental aspect of Scala's design", but could you please give a short explanation or point us to the part of the Scala spec where this is specified?

I've come across this Jira (and the SO question) after Googling for "scala implicit with the same name", but so far I still don't know why two implicits with the same name are ignored.
I went (very quickly, I might have missed something) through Scala's specification chapter 7 about implicits (http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/07-implicits.html)
and did not find anything related to having multiple implicits with the same name.

The only clue I've found so far is someone in the SO comments saying that "That's a feature not a bug, because it's how you disable implicits that might be in scope".
When I searched for "scala disabling implicit", I did not find much more, but I found that you can disable implicits by renaming them like that "import myImplicit => _".

When two implicits with the same name and different signature exist, why doesn't the compiler at least throw a warning, rather than silently ignoring them?

I apologize if I just did not search deep enough, but I believe this JIRA should not be closed without giving a proper answer to the question.
Hopefully, that way, the next guy asking the same question will not spend as much time as I did to find the answer.

Thanks
