(In r21991) Misoptimization for list extractors caused non-sequences to
incorrectly match.  Closes SI-3050, SI-2800.  No review.
Code gets refused in Scala 2.9.0.r24145-b20110130020134:

{code}
scala> "" match { case List(x @ _*) => x }
<console>:6: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : List[A]
 required: java.lang.String
       "" match { case List(x @ _*) => x }
                           ^
{code}

It looks like this is the right behaviour.
Ouch sorry. "" is checked in newer versions so it doesn't get to the bug anymore.

{code}
("": Any) match { case List(x @ _*) => x }
{code}

This still does. Reopening. Sorry for the spam. :-/
(In r24812) Working my way through pattern matcher sequence issues mostly caused
by the special handling of Lists.  Also deleting all kinds of
useless or almost useless code which is presently only clutter.

Closes SI-2756, SI-2800, SI-3050, SI-3530, SI-3972, no review.
