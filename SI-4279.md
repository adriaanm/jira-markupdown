=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
val million = Array.range(1,1000000)
val veryslow = million.view.slice(999997,999999)
for (i <- 1 to 10) veryslow.foreach(println)  // You can see this scroll!
val fast = million.slice(999997,999999)
for (i <- 1 to 10) fast.foreach(println)  // Instant
{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Sliced views are as fast as an additional check for being in range and an addition to the index.

=== What do you see instead? ===
Foreach takes time proportional to the starting index of the slice, even for IndexedSeqOptimized.  Slices are one area where views should usually be exactly the right way to go; right now, they're usually exactly the wrong way to go.

=== Additional information ===
This could be fixed by overriding foreach in Sliced in various places outside of TraversableViewLike.  There is no great candidate, unfortunately, given the current hierarchy.  mutable.IndexedSeqView should almost certainly override, but that would still leave Vector and SortedMap with painfully slow slices.  SeqView is another possibility, but you really don't want to index List this way--the TraversableViewLike method is better there.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r24324
  - Java: 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.04

D'oh, sorry, it's just that I coast through life only looking at first and last letters, p------c.  I mean Alex.  I'll try for it today but if I haven't fixed it by thursday morning you are invited to wrest it away.

(In r24432) A patch for views.  Most relevant change:

  Almost all view classes now list parents like
    trait Appended[B >: A] extends super.Appended[B] with Transformed[B]
  instead of the former
    trait Appended[B >: A] extends Transformed[B] with super.Appended[B]

because as it was, the implementation of foreach in TraversableViewLike#Transformed
was repeatedly trumping overrides found in e.g. IterableLike.  This change
was not without its own consequences, and much of the rest of the patch
is dealing with that.  A more general issue is clearly revealed here: there
is no straightforward way to deal with trait composition and overrides when
some methods should prefer B over A and some the reverse.  (It's more like
A through Z in this case.)

That closes SI-4279, with some views being five orders of magnitude slower
than necessary.  There is a test that confirms they'll stay performance
neighbors.

In the view classes (Zipped, Mapped, etc.) I attended to them with comb and
brush until they were reasonably consistent.  I only use "override" where
necessary and throw in some "final" in the interests of trying to anchor the
composition outcome.  I also switched the newSliced, newZipped, etc. methods
to use early init syntax since a number have abstract vals and I found at least
one bug originating with uninitialized access.

There was a piece of a parallel collections scalacheck test failing, which
I disabled out of expedience - am emailing prokopec.

There is plenty of work left to do but paulp must get back to other 2.9 issues.
This is the Zurich->SF airplane patch.  No review.
