I attach a patch that improves the efficiency of some Map traversal operations, particularly when it comes to allocation of tuples in mutable.HashMap, but not only. This patch should be applied after the one from ticket #2524.
Philipp, this ticket relates somehow to the ticket #2524 which I assigned to you some time ago. Perhaps this one is also yours? Sorry for possible mistake...
Thanks for submitting the patch. However, I think I found a problem:
```scala
  /* Override to avoid tuple allocation in foreach */
  override def keySet: collection.Set[A] = new DefaultKeySet {
    override def foreach[C](f: A => C) = foreachEntry(_.key)
  }
```
In the body of the overridden `foreach` you are never calling `f`. I suppose you want to do
```scala
    override def foreach[C](f: A => C) = foreachEntry(e => f(e.key))
```
It seems this should be covered by a test case, which apparently it is not. Could you please revise your patch and add tests for each overridden method? Thanks.
(In r19762) Applied performance patch and test case from ijuma; closes #2526.
