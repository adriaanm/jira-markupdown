First example doesn't work, should I think.  All the other variations do work.
{code}
scala> "%d %d".format(Array(5, 10): _*)
java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Object;

scala> "%d %d".format(Array[Integer](5, 10): _*)
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
res7: String = 5 10

scala> "%d %d %d".format((Array(1,2,3): Seq[Int]) : _*)
res8: String = 1 2 3

scala> "%d %d".format(5, 10) 
res9: String = 5 10

{code}
The first line gets compiled to:

{code}
Predef.augmentString("%d %d").format(Predef.genericWrapArray(
  Array.apply(5, Predef.wrapIntArray(Array[Int]{10})).$$asInstanceOf[Array[java.lang.Object]]()
));
{code}

Which looks strange (why the wrapIntArray on the second argument only?)
Replying to [comment:2 dubochet]: 
> Which looks strange (why the wrapIntArray on the second argument only?)

Turns out that's because all the scala.Array primitive applies look like this:
{code}
  def apply(x: Int, xs: Int*): Array[Int] = {
{code}
Presumably because otherwise all the overloads look the same after erasure.

I propose that the thing it's trying to do, which doesn't work in the fashion it's trying:
{code}
$$asInstanceOf[Array[java.lang.Object]]
{code}
should exist as a method on WrappedArray with a name like "toBoxed".  It would be plus or minus:
{code}
def toBoxed: Array[AnyRef] = array map (_.asInstanceOf[AnyRef])
{code}
