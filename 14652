Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19371-b20091102102036 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

This is a build manager issue that can be reproduced using !BuildManagerTest.

Given A.scala, B.scala with contents:
```scala
class A {
	def x(i: Int) = i+"3"
}
class B extends A {
	def x(s: String) = s+"5"
}
```

 1. Compile both sources
 1. Modify 'x' in A.scala to be:
```scala
	def x(i: String) = i+"3"
```
 1. Mark A.scala modified
 1. The build manager will recompile A.scala, but not B.scala.  If B.scala were recompiled, there would be an error that 'override' is required.
