The following code incorrectly throws a MatchError; it doesn't seem to consider the second case.  It should succeed silently.

```scala
Some(123) match {
  case (x:Option[_]) if false => {};
  case (x:Option[_]) => {};
}
```

This is as simple as I've gotten it.  The two patterns seem to need to be the same, and the "_" is somehow important.
