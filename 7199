Yeah, I understood that implicit resolution wouldn't be extensible with {{orderingToPartialOrdering}}; it just seems like not such a bad thing. As things are, you have to pay the import tax for both standard lib stuff and external stuff; with {{orderingToPartialOrdering}}, you'd still have to pay it for external stuff but standard lib stuff would come for free. Seems strictly more useful, if not particularly elegant. But it sounds like your point is that there's an expectation that anything having to do with implicits should be homogeneously extensible, and since there's no good way to do that right now, it's less surprising to do nothing; is that right?

I hadn't thought of the problem with ambiguous conversions for {{Equiv}}, but as long as the inheritance hierarchy is linear, we could get away with omitting {{ordering2Equiv}} and letting the other two views chain, right? But then I guess you'd object that as soon as we come up with any other type class that extends {{Equiv}} or {{PartialOrdering}}, that sets us up for either conflicts or having to choose one favored branch of the inheritance tree for the implicit walk... yeah, that'd be pretty gross. But on the flip side, Paul's comment makes it sound like nobody's going to touch this inheritance hierarchy until we have some kind of holistic solution, so... does it matter that much?

The contravariance problem is interesting, but I don't really see how it's relevant to this, other than that they are both interesting unsolved problems involving inheritance and type classes.
