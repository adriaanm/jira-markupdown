The problem looks similar to SI-8129. An error is issued under silent mode, but rather than being buffered in the innermost typechecking context, which is interrogated when exiting silent mode, it is buffered in its enclosing context. This ends up with an erroneous tree (containing untyped tree) slipping through the typechecking phase to a later phase (superaccessors) where this is noticed and we crash.

However, I cherry picked the fix for SI-8129 onto 2.10.4, but the problem persists. It is hard to know whether or not the root problem has been fixed or not in 2.11, because implicit search now results in ambiguity errors for this program.
