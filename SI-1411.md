This seems to be one of the many weird design defects in the Scala libraries. I _should_ be able to easily define my own streams by simply defining functions for {{head}} and {{tail}}. However, someone made {{addDefinedElems}}, a convenience function that has nothing to do with the stream data type, an abstract method.

The tight coupling of convenience functionality like this seems to come up frequently in the Scala libraries. I'd love to see the libraries evolve to something much cleaner and easier for newcomers to parse. Coming from Java and Haskell, Scala's libraries often seem like an ill-conceived mess. I hope we'll get there before too long: I really like the language, but the libraries need a _lot_ of work.
