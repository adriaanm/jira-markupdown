here's the failure when using mixing:
{code}
  ~/newbug> cat p/J.java 
package p;
public class J {
	int foo;
	public int foo() { return foo ; }
}
  ~/newbug> cat S.scala 
object S extends Application { println((new p.J).foo) }
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac p/J.java S.scala
  ~/newbug> javac p/J.java
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scala S             
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access field p.J.foo from class S$$
	at S$$.<init>(S.scala:1)
	at S$$.<clinit>(S.scala)
	at S.main(S.scala)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)
	at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)

	at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner$$.main(MainGenericRunner.scala:164)
	at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner.main(MainGenericRunner.scala)
{code}

and here's it succeeding if scalac sees the class instead of the source:
{code}
  ~/newbug> rm *.class p/*.class
  ~/newbug> javac p/J.java                                  
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac S.scala 
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scala S       
0
{code}

I'm running r15827.

The obvious workaround, of changing "foo" to "foo()" in S.scala, works.


We need to thread carefully wrt to EmptyPackage. There are some very subtle conventions which most people are unaware of> EmptyPackage is different form Root.
Classes in the empty package can be seen only from other classes in the empty package, never from classes in some other package. This is there to avoid unpleasant surprises
due to junk classes in the empty package. Java behaves the same way, I believe.


Noting for the time being that this patch caused SI-1840.
OK! Thanks to martin disabusing me of my crazy ideas about how flags map to access semantics, I think this is fixed for real in r17416, as is SI-1840.
Sadness: still not right, and also caused SI-1842.
fwiw, it is working for me on my actual codebase —�I was able to remove all the workarounds I'd had to add to my code way back when. though I did have to insert a new one for SI-1842 :-)
