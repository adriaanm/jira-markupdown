A.scala:
{code}
abstract class A{
    val a: Int
    val b: Int
    val c: Int = 12
}
{code}
B.scala:
{code}
class B extends A{

  val a = 10
  //object bb
  lazy val bb = 17
  val b = 12
}

object Test {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        println(new B().bb)
    }
}
{code}
The order of compilation *matters*! So
{code}
scalac A.scala B.scala -Xcheckinit
scala -cp . test
0
{code}
but 
{code}
scalac B.scala A.scala -Xcheckinit
scala -cp . test
17
{code}

The problem is that in the first case we use the inherited bitmap from A, but in the second one we actually create a new one for class B (yet still using the same bit).
This breaks current nightly with Xcheckinit flag because of the nested object to lazy val translation (SI-1591). Both SpecializeTypes.TypeEnv and SubComponent.internal share the same bit and bitmap and the latter is set during the initialization.
I wonder how we were so "lucky" not to hit this bug before.
Seems to be connected to SI-3038.

Yes, there is always some trade-off. I will bring it up on the meeting. 

wrt to the bug. We shouldn't produce different bytecode on different compilation order of the files even for a simple case like that:
A.scala
{code}
class A {
    lazy val a = 12
}
{code}
B.scala
{code}
class B extends A {
    lazy val b = 14
}
{code}
This is just asking for trouble.

(In r23232) Fixes SI-3895. The existance and usage of a particular bitmap is independent from the compilation order. Review by dragos.
(In r23323) Closes SI-3059, SI-3895 (the only difference between this and r23232 is the forced info transformation that ensures that nested objects are viewed as lazy vals). sbt integration requires new starr for this commit to work.
