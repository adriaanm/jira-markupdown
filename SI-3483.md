Types and objects allow different case constructs in match expressions. In particular a type can be used in a so called "typed pattern" (case x: B => ...) whereas an object can not. It would be good, if an object could be used in a similar way. Otherwise, if an object is changed into being a class, all corresponding match expressions have to be adjusted.

Example:


```scala
trait Trait
object A extends Trait
class B(b: Int) extends Trait

object Test {

  def test = {
    val t: Trait = null
    t match {
      case A => println("A")
      //case x: A => println("A") // error
      case x: B => println("B")
    }
  }

}
```
As you indicate, it is called a type pattern because you match on a type.  Here, A names a value, not a type.  This is fundamental and I'm pretty sure this alone is sufficient to close this.

You are possibly asking for `x: A` to mean "match if `t` is of type A or is the value A", but you couldn't do anything with `x` since `value A` and type A do not necessarily have a common ancestor other than `AnyRef`.  If they did, you'd just do a type match on that common ancestor.

If you want `case x: A =>` to mean `case A =>` when there is no type, define:
```scala
sealed class A {
  ...
```
object A extends A
{code}
and use a type pattern on A.
That is supposed to be:

```scala
sealed class A {
  ...
}
object A extends A
```
I think you misunderstood me. I asked for a syntactic uniform way that allows to match either an object or an instance. In both cases the object of instance should be bound to a case variable.

At the moment you can use the "@" character to bind a variable to an object and the ":" character to bind a variable to an instance:

```scala
case x @ A => ...do something with object x...
case x : B => ...do something with instance x...
```

In both cases I can use x to access the matched object/instance in a type safe manner.




 
perhaps `case x @ A => ...` should result in a compiler warning, at least under `-Xlint`, since the binding is basically useless and the programmer's intent was more likely `case x: A => ...` than `case A => ...`
