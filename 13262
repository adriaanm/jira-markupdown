Insert a `"` in the parameter list of an existing method (it has to have a body before adding the quote):
```scala
  def foo() {
  }
```

The editor will stop accepting characters (but not freeze, and the file can be saved). Closing and reopening the window works (but it is very fragile, unless the quote is deleted immediately).
