I'll mark this as a duplicate, as it has the same cause and resolution as scala/bug#286. There are plans for a Scala reflection library which will handle this sort of things, but for now the encoding of object names (and sadly, the interpreter wraps everything in obejcts) is incompatible with Sun's implementation of these methods (note that the IBM VM handles them correctly).
