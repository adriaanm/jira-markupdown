If you install the Scala distribution in a path that contains spaces, the tools stop working because the scala-related classes are not found, at least on Linux and OS X. Here is the transcript of a session illustrating the issue:
```scala
[paine /tmp]% tar xjf ~/Downloads/scala-2.7.0-RC2.tar.bz2.tar 
[paine /tmp]% ./scala-2.7.0-RC2/bin/scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.0-RC2 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.5.0_13).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :quit
[paine /tmp]% mv scala-2.7.0-RC2 "scala with space"
[paine /tmp]% ./scala\ with\ space/bin/scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/tools/nsc/MainGenericRunner
```
