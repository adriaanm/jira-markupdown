println(", you are now " + age)
println(", you are now ", + age)

these codes give different outputs

, you are now 25
(, you are now ,25)

using "," after the string it puts the braces in the code is it to be doing or something is wrong. i didnt find anything on the web regarding this so posting this on the blog now.

i have uploaded my files if they are of any use.
You can compiler with -Ywarn-adapted-args if you don't want this slightly questionable "feature" of scalac.

{noformat}
scala -Ywarn-adapted-args -e 'println("", +23)'

Both Scala 2.10.2 and 2.11.0-M5 give me:

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-M5 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_39).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> println(", you are now ", + age)
<console>:8: error: too many arguments for method println: (x: Any)Unit
              println(", you are now ", + age)
{code}

How can I reproduce it?

Ah, I didn't realize that auto tupling won't succeed if there are some other errors (like age not being defined). Thanks
