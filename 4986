so this is really a triple-whammy bug:

1. the spec should be updated, as currently I read it as specifying covariant matching for arrays:
"A parameterized type pattern scala.Array[T1], where T1 is a type pattern.
This type pattern matches any non-null instance of type scala.Array[U1], where U1 is a type matched by T1."

"where U1 is a type matched by T1" should really read "where **a value of type U1** is matched by the type T1"
(this is consistent with the uses of "a value matched by a type" in the other bullets of 8.2)

2. implement invariant matching for arrays (including updating the analyses)

3. implement support for bounded existentials in type patterns

I agree all of these are worthwhile, but I don't think I can do this in time for 2.10.0.
Thus, demoting to major.
