The following code


{noformat}
class A {
  def compareTo(o: Any): Int = 0
}
class B extends A with Comparable[B] {
  def compareTo(b: B): Int = 0
}
object C {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(new B().compareTo(new Object()))
  }
}
{noformat}

compiles without warnings.  And it should be executed without any runtime error.  However, ClassCastException occurs when the code is executed.

This problem is also known as an already fixed bug of Java Generics:
