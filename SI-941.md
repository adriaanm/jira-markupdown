With .scala files at the root of a project and the compiler output directory also set to be the root of the project the Eclipse plugin misbehaves in various ways. Imports are not recognized correctly (SI-939) and errors are not reported correctly in the Problems view (SI-940).

Giving the project a standard structure (.scala in a package hierarchy rooted in a top level src directory, classes compiled to a top-level bin directory) resolves the issue. Nevertheless, the plugin should be able to handle a non-standard project layout.
