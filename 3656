(In r21219) More fun with -Xmigration.  Followed through on the changes
to BufferLike (++ and similar now create a new collection.)
Removed MapLikeBase.  Annotated all the methods in mutable.{ Map, Set }
which mutated in-place in 2.7 to note that they create new
collections, and implemented same.

At this point the only +/- like method which mutates in place
which I am aware of is BufferLike.+ (see source comment for my
observations.)

Also tweaked some collections return types as necessitated by these
changes, such as mutable.Set.clone() now returning "This" rather
than mutable.Set[A].
