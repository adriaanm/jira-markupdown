One of the sub-problems when try-catch's are left in expression positions is a post-CleanUp step to guarantee empty-stack-on-try-entry. Other backends (in particular MSIL) also stand to benefit.

A proposal (in the form of pseudocode) for that transformation can be found at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/VkEL7wOVQpE/aSiNnF3ym-cJ
