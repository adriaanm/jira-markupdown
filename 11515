One can take the `MutableList` approach to partly rescue the behavior: assume that there won't be any change in the middle and use a counter to avoid running off the end.  Note that `MutableList.iterator` is also broken because it doesn't catch the potentially shorter tail.  Also, everyone's vulnerable to `update` changing elements in the middle.
