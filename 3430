Feb 10th? You're a visitor from the future? ;-)

Can you give the the exact version of the IDE (it will contain the exact revision number)?

I expect that this is random upgrade breakage, however. If you're following trunk and updating regularly your install and workspace will accumulate cruft over time (this is a generic Eclipse issue). I recommend always running with the -clean option rather than waiting until something goes wrong.
