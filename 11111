We're always happy to improve the documentation. I suggest narrowing the focus of your ticket that way (or better yet, submit a PR with the documentation you would've liked better!).

Improving the design of PartialFunction is a (tough!) discussion, to be had first on the mailing list. It comes up quite regularly -- e.g.,  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-language/bLpZOmmZUJM. My opinion is that the design is unlikely to change. It would be interesting to explore how we can support alternative abstractions (outside of the standard library) -- perhaps through a clever combination of SAM synthesis and macros.
