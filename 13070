It would be nice if the compiler would warn about unused local val's
and var's to help catch coding mistakes.

If the val or var's is never used, then the compiler could issue
a warning, such as in the following code.

{code}
class Test {
  def unused_var(i : Int) = {
    val a = 10 // should warn that a is never used
    i + 2
  }
}
{code}
