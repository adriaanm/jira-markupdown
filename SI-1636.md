With Scala Perspective selected.

Created package com.foo.bar.splee.

Right moused on the package in Package Explorer. Clicked New Object.

Typed in "BigIntExample2" for name.

Underneath com.foo.bar.splee in Package explorer are now two entries with the name "BigIntExample2.scala". The first one has the "J" icon and the second one has the "S" icon.

Deleting one deletes both.

This will be fixed by the Equinox Aspects based update that'll be landing on trunk soon. In the meantime a workaround is to close and then reopen the project.
