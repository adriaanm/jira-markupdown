It's still buggy. With a freshly installed Eclipse 3.4.2 (Ubuntu Linux) and Scala plug-in 2.7.5 it puts 2 spaces per indentation level when you press Enter (that's okay following the Scala formatting convention. I like this predefined setting) and 4 (or more) spaces when you press TAB at some points, for example:

{code}
object Main {
|<--- From here it jumps 4 spaces when you press TAB
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
|<--- From here it jumps even more, 10 spaces! when you press TAB
  }
}
{code}
