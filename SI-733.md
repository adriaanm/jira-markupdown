I'm baffled why this won't pass the compiler:
```scala
object Tester {
  implicit def pimpMyIterableInt(it: Iterable[Int]) =  
    new { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
  def foo = {
    val triangles:Stream[Int] = Stream.from(1).map(n => (1 to n).sum)
    triangles.take(10).toList
  }
}
```
the error I get is:
```scala
% scalac Tester.scala
Tester.scala:5: error: value sum is not a member of Range.Inclusive
    val triangles:Stream[Int] = Stream.from(1).map(n => (1 to n).sum)
                                                                 ^
one error found
```

if I pull the definition of triangles out of the enclosing definition, then the compiler likes it fine, like this:
```scala
object Tester {
  implicit def pimpMyIterableInt(it: Iterable[Int]) =  
    new { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
  val triangles:Stream[Int] = Stream.from(1).map(n => (1 to n).sum)
}
```

It's because both the implicit and the foo method do not have a return type, yet they are mutually recursive. So the implicit is not yet fully typed, and therefore not available when the function `foo' is typed. Add a return type to either the implicit or the method and it compiles. I'd recommend to always write out return types of implicits to avoid this kind of problem.
thank you. I understand. by the way, I got the definition of the implicit from this blog post:
http://scala-blogs.org/2007/12/project-euler-fun-in-scala.html
I added a comment suggesting a different definition of the implicit that includes a return type.
