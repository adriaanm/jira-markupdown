`Fold` is parameterized by `U`, which means a type-level generic-method.
Scalac, for now, seems not to work well with any form of type-level generics.
I don't know whether this is a bug or limitation of type-system of scala, though.
BTW, you can find a painful workaround: [design guidelines](https://github.com/okomok/sing/wiki/design-guidelines)
