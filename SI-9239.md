Given the following code on Scala 2.11.5 or 2.11.6:

{code:scala}
class Foo[A]
trait Bar[A] extends Foo[A]
class Baz[A] extends Bar[A]
{code}

{{scalap}} says {{Baz}} extends {{Foo}}:

{code:scala}
class Baz[A] extends Foo[A] with Bar[A] {
  def this() = { /* compiled code */ }
}
{code}

But {{javap}} disagrees:

{code:java}
public class Baz<A> implements Bar<A> {
  public Baz();
}

public interface Bar<A> {
}
{code}

This is a change from 2.11.4, which produces this:

{code:java}
public class Baz<A> extends Foo<A> implements Bar<A> {
  public Baz();
}
{code}

Changing {{Baz}} to make it extend {{Foo}} directly has the same result. I don't see the issue when the classes and traits aren't generic.

This caused [Twitter Util|https://github.com/twitter/util] to break when I tried to [update our build from 2.11.4 to 2.11.6 yesterday|https://twitter.com/travisbrown/status/578649688636796928]. I know we should probably be using a self type with a type constraint, but this was still a surprise.
Presumably changed in SI-8931.
More concretely, in:

{code}
class C1; class C2
trait T1 extends C1
trait T2 extends C2
class C3 extends T1 with T2
{code}

There is no way to let Java know that C3 extends both C1 and C2. AFAICT, we used to pick one of them and pretend that we extend it directly, which is what happened before the change to SI-8931. But we can't tell the full story.
[~retronym] actually it's simpler than that. Your example cannot compile without {{C2}} and {{C1}} being related; and even then, {{T1}} and {{T2}} need to be swapped in {{C3}} (that weird rule in SLS ยง5.1 about only allowing superclasses of the first non-trait class to appear after "with"...). So there wouldn't be much information lost when encoding in java.

Anyway, I think I have a fix, I'm looking into it.
