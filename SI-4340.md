= analysis =
At least 9 lines have nothing to do with the actual code, but with how the REPL manages and runs the code internally.

= enhancement recommendation =
Leave out the superfluous lines by default, e. g.:
```scala
scala> throw new Exception
java.lang.Exception
	at .<init>(<console>:12)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:11)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
```

There could also be an REPL option which restores the old behavior, if necessary.
if I have a feeling this is going to get reassigned to scala_community.

for whatever it's worth, sbt has a thing like this, where I can say:
```scala
 log.setTrace(0)  // 0 equals nosbt equals leave out sbt's lines from stack traces
```

looking at whatever sbt is doing there might conceivably help a motivated individual put together a patch.
Also of interest is that it's already in there, I just haven't flipped the switch.  I know I've advertised this one more than once though.
```scala
scal[paulp@stem ~]$$ scala29 -Yrich-exceptions
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.r24470-b20110316065634 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> Nil.head
[Nil.head] (List.scala:381)
(access lastException for the full trace)

```
I have used `lastException` after seeing an elided stacktrace.

I may add that helpful message on the relevant commit.
#7740, #7781
