I'd like a feature in scaladoc that shows all the implicit conversions (both from and to) for a particular type on that type's page which are known to scaladoc at the time of generation.

This is especially useful when most of the interface for a type is provided by implicit conversions to another type.
There's a wiki page for scaladoc enhancements, and this one is already there:
