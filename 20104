The following:

{code:scala}

object Example {
  val op1: (Any, Any) => Unit = {
    case (_, b: Int) =>
  }

  val op2: (Unit, Any) => Unit = {
    case (_, b: Int) =>
  }
}

{code}

Emits the warning:
{quote}Example.scala:6: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: (_, _)
  val op2: (Unit, Any) => Unit = {{quote}

This only seems to happen when mixing wildcard matches on {{Unit}} with type-check matches.
