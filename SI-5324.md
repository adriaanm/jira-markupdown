## Introduction
The piping methods have proven to be extremely useful in other languages: `.with` - Groovy; `.tap` - Ruby. It's a known fact that a lot of people get surprised not to meet any similar feature in Scala as well as that because of that a lot of them introduce custom implicit conversions.

## Examples
Let's consider two examples of how the same purpose of outputting the following text can be achieved with and without the proposed feature:
{noformat}Source: List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Result: [2,4]{noformat}

### Example one: with proposed methods `tap` and `convert`
```scala
Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  .tap(it => println("Source: " + it))
  .filter(_ % 2 == 0)
  .convert(it => if (it.nonEmpty) "[" + it.mkString(",") + "]" else "")
  .tap(it => println("Result: " + it))
```
Please notice how factored, maintainable and easy on the eye the above code is

### Example two: how one has to do it currently
```scala
val tmp1 = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
println("Source: " + tmp1)
val tmp2 = tmp1.filter(_ % 2 == 0)
val tmp3 = if (tmp2.nonEmpty) "[" + tmp2.mkString(",") + "]" else ""
println("Result: " + tmp3)
```
Notice that you have to stop and think 3 times on naming the obviously redundant intermediate variables. Also notice how unreadable, unfactored and harder to manage that code is.

## Implementation
Currently for the first example to work you'll need a following implicit conversion. You can also learn the specification of methods from there:
```scala
implicit def wrapAny[Source](source: Source) = new AnyWrapper(source)
class AnyWrapper[Source](source: Source) {
  def tap[Result](closure: Source => Result): Source = {
    closure(source)
    source
  }
  def convert[Result](closure: Source => Result): Result = {
    closure(source)
  }
}
```

## The suggestions:
1. Introduce a method with codename "convert" (or "use" or "pipe" or "pipeTo" as suggested by some) which executes a closure on the object and returns the result of that closure
2. Introduce a method with codename "tap" (or "effect" as suggested by some) which executes a closure on the object and returns the object itself
3. Not to inherit the scalaz operator-style "|>" title as it is considered disturbing by many
4. Discuss details such as names in this thread



This suggestion originates from the following discussion on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8537992/with-alternative-in-scala/8538277
For reference, there's an implementation of this in trunk I use in the repl, which looks pretty much identical except for the type parameter names.
```scala
  implicit def enrichAnyRefWithTap[T](x: T) = new TapMaker(x)
  class TapMaker[T](x: T) {
    def tap[U](f: T => U): T = {
      f(x)
      x
    }
  }
```
Since I suggested effect, I feel qualified to recommend tap instead; it's shorter and gets the point across.

I don't like convert, because it's too long and things like `x.convert(_+2)` don't really seem like much of a conversion.  I like `pipe` or `ap` or `app` or `as` or `be` (not great grammar on that last one, but it's short and gets the point across...).
I support `as` as a replacement of `convert` since it has very close semantics and is really succinct. I don't support `pipe` since its semantics are coarse and misleading. `ap` and `app` are abbreviations and I don't remember any abbreviations being used in the standard library. Semantics of `be` are too broad.

Actually I came up with `as` on my own and now that I see that Rex has already posted it I support his suggestion twice as much )
