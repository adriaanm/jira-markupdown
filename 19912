Scala 2.11.7 doesn't warn me that the match may not be exhaustive on the following code snippet:

{code:scala}
class Foo {

  def foo = {
    abstract sealed class Animal
    case class Goat(age: Int) extends Animal
    case class Horse(age: Int) extends Animal

    val x: Animal = Goat(1)
    x match {
      case Goat(_) ⇒ println("a goat")
    }
  }
}
{code}

When I move the sealed class hierarchy outside the foo function, it warns me correctly.

{code:scala}
class Foo {

  abstract sealed class Animal
  case class Goat(age: Int) extends Animal
  case class Horse(age: Int) extends Animal

  def foo = {
    val x: Animal = Goat(1)
    x match {
      case Goat(_) ⇒ println("a goat")
    }
  }
}
{code}

Foo.scala:11: match may not be exhaustive
[warn] It would fail on the following input: Horse(_)
[warn]     x match {
[warn]     ^
[warn] one warning found
