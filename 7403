IMHO, the major problem is that the treatment of "case" classes just does not belong to the core language - it should be part of a library, so that different variants could be easily added, too. I just opened a request for improvement (SI-5607) about this.

If we had something like
{code}
@case class foo(i: Int, j: Int)
{code}
it would become easy to support things like:
{code}
@case(all_param_lists=true) class foo(i: Int, j: Int)
{code}
or whichever other syntax is preferred.
