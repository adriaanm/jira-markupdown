Suggested fixes: 

(1)
Add
`override def stringPrefix: String = "HashSet"`
to (im)mutable.`HashSet` and potential other descendants

(2)
Remove
`override def stringPrefix: String = "Set"`
from `SetLike`. Why was this override introduced. There is none for `SeqLike`. But there is one for `MapLike`.
Fixed in r24286.

I think this might be a won't-fix (as it changes all the string output and breaks tests that depend on that, such as the compiler test suite), but I'm assigning to the meeting anyway.
