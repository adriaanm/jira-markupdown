simplified test case:
```scala
object Test {
  // bug only triggers if both these methods are named exactly like this and neither has a return type
  // rename _1 to _a1, or similar for _2 and it works; also, as Jason said, adding either result type avoids the crash
  // is symbol resolution considering the method `_1` for the named argument reference `_1` ??
  def _1 = (0, 0) copy (_1 = 1)
  def _2 = (0, 0) copy (_2 = 2)
}
```

re-assigning to Lukas since named arguments seem to be the crux of the problem
