It would be nice to have something equivalent to [Twitter's Local](https://twitter.github.io/util/docs/com/twitter/util/Local.html) in [scala.concurrent](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.8/#scala.concurrent.package).

In other words, something like Java's [ThreadLocal|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html] which follows the application flow (rather than JVM threads) when using {{scala.concurrent.Future}}?
