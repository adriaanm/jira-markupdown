Stream.continually(1).filter(_ == 1).take(5).foreach(println)
Stream.continually(1).filterNot(_ != 1).take(5).foreach(println)

The first line will complete, the second will not. 

Reason: the Stream class does not override TraversableLike.filterNot which forces evaluation of the whole stream.

This looks like a duplicate of https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8627. Please reopen if I'm wrong!
