The thing is that `j.l.Throwable.getStackTraceDepth()` is package-protected, and the following program doesn't compile:
```
object O extends Throwable

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    O.getStackTraceDepth()
  }
}
```

The error reads
```
error: method getStackTraceDepth in class Throwable cannot be accessed in object O
    O.getStackTraceDepth()
      ^
one error found
```
