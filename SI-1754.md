{code}
scala> val x: AnyRef = "abc".asInstanceOf
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to scala.runtime.Nothing$$

scala> val x: Any = 5.asInstanceOf       
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to scala.runtime.Nothing$$
{code}
This would be possible only if we special case asInstanceOf, and I don't think we should do that.

That's fine.  I ask because I couldn't figure out what ticket SI-109 was trying to report, and it used asInstanceOf that way:
{code}
    def complete(sym : global.Symbol) = {
      Console.println("completing " + sym)
      typeParser.parseType(sym.asInstanceOf)
    }
{code}
OK, it took me 2.5 years but I have to reopen this (reminded of it by SI-4871.) Why would this imply special casing asInstanceOf? As far as I can see it's the opposite: asInstanceOf is being given special status by not having to act the way everything else does.

Easily summarized:

{code}
scala> class Bip { def empty[T: Manifest, CC[_]] = { println(manifest[T]) ; null.asInstanceOf[CC[T]] } }
defined class Bip

scala> val x: Set[Int] = (new Bip).empty
Int
x: Set[Int] = null

scala> val x: Set[Int] = (new Bip).asInstanceOf
java.lang.ClassCastException: Bip cannot be cast to scala.runtime.Nothing$
{code}
Upon what basis should it infer Set[Int] when given nothing to go upon but the expected type, but in the same situation asInstanceOf should infer Nothing?
