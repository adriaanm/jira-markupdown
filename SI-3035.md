Operator notation is great for designing a DSL but their are some limits which makes it in some cases really difficult.
for example:
 val f = (x:Int) => println(x)
 f 5   //Error
 f apply 5 //Ok
 println "Hello" //Error

If it would be possible to omit the apply on funtions following DSL would became possible:

  select * from 'User
  select 'name 'prename from 'User

select could be a partial appied function whitch is applied for a * object or a symbol and returns a partial applied function for a from object in the * case or for a from object and symbol in the symbol case.

at the moment i had to write something like this for the first:
Sql select * from 'User
for the second somthing like
Sql select "name prename" from 'User   or
Sql select 'name apply 'prename from 'User
Well I think you can get pretty close:
(also use three curly braces to surround syntax, see the wiki formatting)
{code}
object SqlDsl {
  case object *
  def SELECT(all : *.type) : SelectClause = SelectAllClause
  def SELECT(sels : Symbol*) : SelectClause = SelectSomeClause(sels)
  sealed trait SelectClause {
    def FROM(from : Symbol) : Query = Query(this, FromClause(from))
  }
  case object SelectAllClause extends SelectClause
  case class SelectSomeClause(sels : Seq[Symbol]) extends SelectClause
  case class Query(selectClause : SelectClause, fromClause : FromClause)
  case class FromClause(from : Symbol)
}
{code}
--usage:
you have to have a parens around the items in the select call, though I don't see it as being all that terrible. I think that maybe you can get even better with perhaps 
{code}
import SqlDsl._
println(SELECT(*) FROM 'User)
println(SELECT('Name, 'PreName) FROM 'User)
println(SELECT ('Name, 'PreName) FROM 'User)
{code}
yielding:
{code}
Query(SelectAllClause,FromClause('User))
Query(SelectSomeClause(Array('Name, 'PreName)),FromClause('User))
Query(SelectSomeClause(Array('Name, 'PreName)),FromClause('User))
{code}
