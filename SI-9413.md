The following trivial example produces a compiler error:

```scala
class A {
  val b = ""
  def f(b: Option[String] = Some(b))
}

```

The error is 

```
Error:(3, 34) type mismatch;
 found   : Option[String]
 required: String
  def f(b: Option[String] = Some(b))
                                 ^
```

The error seems to suggest the compiler is trying to initialize `b` argument with itself, not with the `b` field, when the `b` field should be the only possible valid interpretation in this context, as `b` argument is not visible in the parameter list itself.
Hah. In fact, default argument expressions are always type-checked in a context where the parameter is in scope - this is a bug.
The reason: normal value definitions are allowed to be recursive, so we need a special case for parameters.

Now, unfortunately we cannot just use the outer context, because parameters of a previous parameter list are visible: `def f(x: Int)(y: Int = x)` is valid.
The type checker doesn't have a scope per parameter list, only one per method, so there's no easy fix.

Here's another bug that has the same underlying reason:

```scala
class A {
  type T
}

class C {
  val a: A
  def f(a: String, b: a.T) = 0
}
```

By the spec (http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/04-basic-declarations-and-definitions.html#default-arguments):
{quote}The scope of a formal value parameter name x comprises all subsequent parameter clauses, as well as the method return type and the function body.
{quote}

So the parameter `a` should not be in scope in the type definition of `b`. However, in reality, the type checker will resolve `a` in `a.T` to the parameter instead of the field and yield an error:

```
error: type T is not a member of String
         def f(a: String, b: a.T) = 0
                               ^
```
