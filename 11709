Well, the fix fixes the problem, but it's outrageously incompatible because the autogenerated serialVersionUID changes when you add readResolve.  So--boom!--you can't pass these around.  Finding and fixing every "eq Inf" is messy and painful.

It's _possible_, I guess, to ask ASM to rewrite the bytecode of scala.concurrent.duration.Duration$$anon$1 through 3 to contain a private static final long serialVersionUID of the right value.  But, ugh?
