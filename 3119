It really does not look very elegantly but I have not found a better solution. 

The STACK_DEPTH_LIMIT should not be too big, because you never know where you are in the stack, but 100 seems reasonable.

Since List#reverse is linear in list size, as is foldLeft, it would probably make the implementation more elegant if "reverse" would always be used and the "small list" case would not be considered, without making it unreasonably slower.
