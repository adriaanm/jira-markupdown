```scala
scala> /*//*/ val s = 0
s: Int = 0
```

When there is a //* in a multi line comment the compiler treats this not
as start of a nested comment (I expected that it does).
```scala
scala> /*/*//*/ val s = 0*/*/*/ val p = 0
p: Int = 0
```

Here, with nested multi line comments the //* is treated as another
nested opening multi line comment.

The behavior is inconsistent. Either single line comments should adopt the behavior of multi line comments or vice versa.

I brought this to the mailing list but didn't get a comment there: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/scala-internals/ZdjsTweL31M
