The following works as expected:
{code}
scala> trait A
defined trait A

scala> trait B
defined trait B

scala> trait C
defined trait C

scala> val x : A with B with C = new A with B with C { }
x: A with B with C = $$anon$$1@e099cb

scala> val x : A with (B with C) = new A with B with C { }
x: A with B with C = $$anon$$1@74a6b4

scala> val x : (A with B) with C = new A with B with C { }
x: A with B with C = $$anon$$1@1a600a8
{code}

But the following are disallowed:
{code}
scala> val x : A with B with C = new (A with B) with C { }
<console>:7: error: class type required
       val x : A with B with C = new (A with B) with C { }
                                      ^

scala> val x : A with B with C = new A with (B with C) { }
<console>:7: error: class type required
       val x : A with B with C = new A with (B with C) { }
                                             ^
{code}



A related problem:
{code}
scala> type T = B with C
defined type alias T

scala> val x : A with B = new A with T { }
<console>:7: error: class type required
       val x : A with B = new A with T { }
{code}
It seems reasonable to want to define a "premixed" version of two traits instead of having to repeat "with B with C" everywhere.

I agree it might be useful. It's not quite clear what it should mean,
though. Expand all aliases, drop parens and then do linearization? Or
do the parens affect linearization, and, if, yes, how?
we took the easy way out and outlawed these idioms.
