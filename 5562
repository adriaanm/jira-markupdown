In 2.8.1 there was also this:
{code}
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder ++= "Hello World"
sb: StringBuilder = StringBuilder(H, e, l, l, o,  , W, o, r, l, d)

scala> sb dropRight 1 toString                     
res0: String = ArrayBuffer(H, e, l, l, o,  , W, o, r, l)

scala> sb.toString dropRight 1
res1: String = Hello Worl  
{code}
Now it acts like this:
{code}
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder ++= "Hello World"
sb: StringBuilder = Hello World

scala> sb dropRight 1 toString
res0: java.lang.String = Hello Worl

scala> sb.toString dropRight 1
res1: String = Hello Worl  
{code}
It is able to behave this way because StringBuilder is now a Builder for StringBuilders, not for Strings.

A consequence of this is that .result() returns a StringBuilder.

I don't see any way to change this, nor any reason that calling result represents an improvement.  (I realize the change is undesirable simply for being a change, but it is otherwise an improvement.)
