I realized that this bug affects package objects in a common use case so I now believe that this bug should be fixed (possibly after 2.8).

It turns out that you get the same error when you create a package object in a file with the same name as the package object if the package object is not in the default package.

For example:
{code}
//file: /src/po.scala
package object po { }
{code}
compiles fine, but
{code}
//file: /src/bugs/po.scala
package bugs
package object po { }
{code}
produces the following message: "po is already defined as object po".

I believe it is a common case to place a package object in a file with the same name and so this bug should be fixed.
