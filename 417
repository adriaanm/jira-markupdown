The given example works since 2.7.1.  This is strange to me, because I could swear I've tried it since then and it didn't work (and 2.7.2RC4 is mentioned above, which would imply it wasn't working in 2.7.1) but that is the situation.  I'm closing this as fixed unless someone would like to offer an example which doesn't work.
