The compiler offers to way to discover what are the valid options for the {{-language}} parameter, nor does any kind of validation on what is passed to it. That makes it very difficult to check for things like {{-language:experimental.macros}} vs {{-language:experimental.macro}}.
Also learned you can say {{scalac -language postfixOps -- file.scala}}, which is why {{scalac -language file.scala}} doesn't yield a meaningful message.

I thought that was covered under {{-Xscalista}}.

No one will disagree, I just forgot the use case when struggling against the fluency of the options API. Thanks!

I wonder if it's worth retrofitting e.g. {{-Xprint:_}}.  Just a thought.
