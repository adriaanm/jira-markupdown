An observation about inlining in [1]:

```
inlining is a powerful enabling optimization; by eliminating the actual call it not only offers an obvious direct benefit but also indirect benefits, as information about the method's arguments is propagated from caller to callee. 
```

Currently `Inliner` does not propagate the arguments' (more precise) types (in particular an anonymous class) to the callee formals (we leave it for the JVM to figure that out). 

In more detail, `dupLocal()` in `doInline()` creates local vars for the args of the inlined callsite. Rather than giving them the types obtained via TFA, it reuses those for the callee's formal params. Moreover, during:

```
/** Map an instruction from the callee to one suitable for the caller. */
def map(i: Instruction): Instruction = {
```


there's an opportunity to devirtualize calls (in the inlined callee).

One more TODO: the TFA should track non-nullness (necessary for #5850) and type-exactness (as resulting from new).
