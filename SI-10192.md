Compiling the following trait with 2.12.0 vs 2.12.1 produces different bytecode
{code:java}
trait Actor {
  @throws(classOf[Exception]) // when changing this you MUST also change ActorDocTest
  //#lifecycle-hooks
  def preStart(): Unit = ()
}
{code}

Classfile produced with 2.12.0:
{code:java}
Compiled from "A.scala"
public interface Actor {
  public static void preStart$(Actor) throws java.lang.Exception;
  public void preStart() throws java.lang.Exception;
  public static void $init$(Actor);
}
{code}

Classfile produced with 2.12.1:

{code:java}
public interface Actor {
  public static void preStart$(Actor);
  public void preStart() throws java.lang.Exception;
  public static void $init$(Actor);
}
{code}

Note how the signature of method {{preStart$}} is different.
Likely culprit: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5570

{{@throws}} is an annotations and annotations are not added to static super accessors anymore...
