OK that this is pushed to 2.12.1, thanks for thorough investigation.

So just doing some house cleaning: I have added a workaround in [this cats PR](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1382) - could someone cast a quick eye that the fix is the best for now, please? Then I can leave this for a while...

Thx - Alistair
