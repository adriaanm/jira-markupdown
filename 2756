OK, this is probably not in bytecode generation where the fault is, but it's that somewhere someone puts a wrong owner on a symbol. More specifically, it seems to be an anonymous class that refers to an enclosing anonymous function symbol, where instead it should refer to the class defining that anonymous function. Bytecode generation just detected the problem. It would be important to know exactly what code caused the error. Is it standard Scala code, or code that's generated by some framework? How is the generation done? Adriaan, could you try to reproduce this, instrumenting bytecode generation so that we get the whole ownerchain when we see the problem? Then we can take it from there, hopefully.
