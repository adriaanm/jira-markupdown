re: the status of Scala's JSR 223 support, see #8422
I imagine it would be possible to work around this by casting the ScriptEngine returned to IMain:

```
val engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("scala")
val iMain = engine.asInstanceOf[scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain]
```

and then just interact with it directly with there, bypassing the official JSR 223 API. (I don't know IMain well enough to give details offhand, though.)
It's good to have a workaround for cases where one controls the source of the calls to `ScriptEngineManager`. 
But let's not forget the whole reason for JSR-223 is to address pluggable scripting components without doing that kind of thing.
thanks Maggie! it seems nearly certain the PR will be merged once @som-snytt finds time to do a little more work on it.
