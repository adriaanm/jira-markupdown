Pasting code with :paste fails when TAB's are present.
TABS are (very) common characters in code and should be anticipated and handled correctly by :paste (I.e. ignored/ not invoking completion)
If :paste with code containing TABS does not fail the paste is very slow.
JLine handles the tab for completion, but "42.\ttoString" has the same result both at the prompt and in paste mode. It erroneously detects completion.
```scala
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

42.
%   +   >    >>>            isInstanceOf   toDouble   toLong     unary_+   |   
&   -   >=   ^              toByte         toFloat    toShort    unary_-       
*   /   >>   asInstanceOf   toChar         toInt      toString   unary_~       
42.toString

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

res0: String = 42

```
Didn't JLine try to detect pasted tabs?
It works for interpreter.jline.InteractiveReader to
```scala
reader setCopyPasteDetection true
```
