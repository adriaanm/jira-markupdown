See https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/scala-internals/gnvcWsmAPaY:

```scala
class Test {
  def foo = {
// workaround: val dv: QuasiTensor[Int,Int] = DenseVector[Int]() // QuasiTensor does not have overloaded apply
   val dv = breeze.linalg.DenseVector[Int]()
   dv.apply(0) // java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: List(method apply$mcI$sp, method apply$mcI$sp)
  }
}
```

fails with breeze 0.11.x and 0.12-SNAPSHOT (the latter was compiled with 2.11.7, afaict)
Vaguely related to #9089, but as this was fixed in 2.11.5 and the problem still occurs with breeze compiled with 2.11.7, i conclude it's a separate issue.
