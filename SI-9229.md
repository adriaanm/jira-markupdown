Currently it's like

```scala
class Set[T]{
  def union(other:GenSet[T]):Set[T]
}
```
Which means that if B is a subclass of A,
```scala
val sa = Set(new A)
val sb = Set(new B)
val su:Set[A] = sa union sb
```
 which is a simple request, results in a compile error. The Set\[B\] is invariant so it can't be taken as a Set\[A\] and union wont take Set\[B\]s for no reason I can imagine.
If, instead, the signature was
```scala
class Set[T]{
  def union[ST <: T](other:GenSet[ST]):Set[T]
}
```
everything would be golden.
The same criticism applies to the intersect method.
