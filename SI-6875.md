^C12:22 ~/Projects/ScalaMock (typemacros)$ 
{code}
Explanation:

imagine we have a file named A.scala, which defines a trait named Foo and a module named Main
Main contains a call to a macro, which calls c.introduceTopLevel to define a mock for Foo
c.introduceTopLevel creates a virtual file Virt35af32.scala, which contains a class named FooMock extending Foo,
and macro expansion instantiates FooMock. the stage is now set. let's see what happens next.

without this workaround in scalac or without being patched itself, sbt will think that
* Virt35af32 depends on A (because it extends Foo from A)
* A depends on Virt35af32 (because it contains a macro expansion referring to FooMock from Virt35af32)

after compiling A.scala, SBT will notice that it has a new source file named Virt35af32.
it will also think that this file hasn't yet been compiled and since A depends on it
it will think that A needs to be recompiled.

recompilation will lead to another macro expansion. that another macro expansion might choose to create a fresh mock,
producing another virtual file, say, Virtee509a, which will again trick SBT into thinking that A needs a recompile,
which will lead to another macro expansion, which will produce another virtual file and so on
Eugene, I just ran across your work-around. My questions are:

  1. Why do you introduce those virtual files in the first place? Is this a new mechanism or it existed before in scalac?
  2. What would be correct way to fix this in sbt?

I don't know the details so I still don't know what's tricky here. In Scala, you can put class definition anywhere so you don't need to mutate tree globally but just locally. So:
{code}
class Foo extends macroDef("A")
{code}

could be expanded to
{code}
class macroDefExpanded_A { .. }
class Foo extends macroDefExpanded_A { .. }
{code}

and this is fairly local.

The problem is those virtual compilation units is that it's not clear how to track dependencies on them, also IDE will have a very hard time to work with them when it does indexing or resolves target of "Jump to definition".
Eugene, creating compilation units out of blue does not seem a lot better to me than having a table of things you generated and you need to put into the right place afterwards.

Also, if {{typedParentTypes}} does not allow you to rewrite trees then maybe you need to refactor that? I don't know all the details but tracking dependencies is an important topic for incremental compilation and we'll need to figure out solid solution for that. I outlined challenges we face here:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/b95Y-GbXVGA/xOL8LMS2-LMJ

Until we figure out principled solution to incremental compilation and macros I'll ignore the whole issue as I want to support regular Scala code first. Also, I'll revert your work-around for type macros so I have one less thing to worry about when improving incremental compiler. I'll put your as reviewer for that change.
