A compilation error is returned when trying to compile a scala file containing a value defined in inherited class as protected:

{code:title=a/Foo.scala}
package a

class Foo {
  protected[Foo] var x = 0
}
{code}

{code:title=b/Bar.scala} 
package b

class Bar extends a.Foo {
  println(x)
}
{code}

{code}
$ fsc a/Foo.scala
$ fsc b/Bar.scala 
b/Bar.scala:4: error: not found: value x
  println(x)
          ^
one error found
$
{code}

If the 2 scala files are compile at the same time, the compilation goes fine.

{code}
$ fsc a/Foo.scala b/Bar.scala 
$ 
{code}
