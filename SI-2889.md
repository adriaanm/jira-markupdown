With two classes:

JavaB.java--public class JavaB { public int i = 1; }

ScalaC.java--class ScalaC { val b = new JavaB() }

Causes the line "val b" to get a "JavaB does not have a constructor" error. Note that technically there are no real Problems, this is just a line error.

Making the error goes away requires manually changing JavaB (e.g. set i = 2), then manually changing ScalaC (e.g. rename val b to val c). Basically, incrementally compiling each file, then the "no constructor" error goes away.

Hitting clean build makes it come back.

I'm using r20428.


This might be related to SI-2767. The behavior you described appears and in pure Scala projects and might be related to [http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A--scala-tools--Error-highlights-in-Eclipse-Scala-p26480821.html this].
@shaberman:

This is a duplicate of SI-2767 and the the example you provide translated to Scala is the simplest code that triggers this long standing bug.

A HUGE thanks for submitting this bug report!

@milessabin:

This is a duplicate of SI-2767 and provides the much awaited simple code example that reproduces the Clean&Build bug.

To reproduce the bug use:

{code}
// file: /src/A.scala
class A {
  var a = 10
}
{code}

and 

{code}
// file: /src/B.scala
class B {
  val a = new A
}
{code}

After saving B, do a Clean&Build and you will get a bogus error message in the editor saying: "A does not have a constructor".

This might be a different bug than SI-2767. There are two ways to trigger this.

*The 1st way*
 1. Create a Scala project
 2. Create a Scala class _A_ in the default package
 3. Create the following class in the default package
{code}
class B {
  val a = new A
}
{code}
 4. Do a Clean&Build

After step 4 we get a bogus error in the editor saying: "A does not have a constructor".

*The 2nd way*
 1. Create a Scala project
 2. Create a Scala class _A_ in the default package
 3. Do a Clean&Build
 4. Create the following class in the default package
{code}
class B {
  val a = new A
}
{code}

After step 4 we get a bogus error in the editor saying: "A does not have a constructor".
Fixed in r20501. All the cases mentioned in this ticket work as expected. However the bug turned out to be specific to sources in the default package, so it might well be that SI-2767 is unrelated.
Yeah, I'm seeing it outside the default package, but cool that this case was fixed. I'll switch to SI-2767 for any future possible reproductions of this. Thanks!
Ignore my last comment it was for bug SI-2767. Sorry :-(
