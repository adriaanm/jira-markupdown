Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-RC2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_09).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> class Foo {
     | final val bar = 500 * 1000L
     | }
defined class Foo

scala> val foo = new Foo
foo: Foo = Foo@77e8e168

scala> foo.bar
res0: Long = 500000

scala> val field = foo.getClass.getDeclaredField("bar")
field: java.lang.reflect.Field = private final long Foo.bar

scala> field.setAccessible(true)

scala> field.get(foo)
res2: Object = 0
```
The fact that the field has never been populated is a pretty compelling argument that it is not useful for java interop - it could never have helped anyone achieve any interesting form of interop unless they only use their fields to store 0, false, and null, or the form of interop being pursued is for "people who only check if the field exists, but never read it", which seems unlikely.

On the strength of that evidence, how about we just don't generate the field, as previously suggested and elaborated upon in #4605.
