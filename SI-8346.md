[{{3cc99d7}}|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/3cc99d7b4aa43b1b06cc837a55665896993235fc] deprecated overriding the casting {{Set#toSet}} introduced in SI-3953.  This cast is demonstrably unsafe, so at least overriding should not be deprecated, unless the types of operations like {{+}} change.  I imagine the cast should be overridden in the collections library where it is unsound, or moved to leaves where it's known to be sound.

The above CCE occurs in 2.10.3, 2.10.4-RC3, and 2.11.0-M8.  The deprecation warning occurs in 2.11.0-M8.
Ugh.  The problem is not with the deprecation of overriding, it's with the covariance-friendly form of {{toSet}} that does not play well with typeclass-style restrictions.  I seriously doubt there is a solution here that is less drastic than "rewrite the whole collections library".  I'll look into it more, though.
{{Set#toSet}} could just do what {{Seq#toSet}} does; the former is no more evil than the other.  And {{HashSet#toSet}}, specifically, could be where the casting version goes, and likewise to any other {{Set}} subclasses that are representationally covariant.  Regardless, the override deprecation goes away in this scheme.
It's pretty obvious that {{Seq#toSet}} is going to recreate the entire collection.  It's much less obvious that {{Set#toSet}} will.  That {{SortedSet.toSet}} is broken is evidence of that.  I think the solution is to add a protected abstract method that you override to indicate whether it can be covariant or not.  Not pretty, but less bad I guess than the alternatives.
