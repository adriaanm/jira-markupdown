I run:
```scala
scalac -d bin proc.scala commons/*.scala
```

and get a long error message which I've attached. I've also attached all the source files. I'm sorry I don't have time to create a small test case.

However, if I moved the definiton of the three classes Durations, Stats, Accumulator out into the top of object Main, everything's dandy.
