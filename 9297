Resolution needs a policy.  Another example is SI-7188.

Maybe it's easy to scan for a PR comment, or conversely for a PR with the SI.

If Jira can be configured with other resolutions, some alternatives besides "not a bug" might be:

"I got my Jira fix for today."
"It bugged *me*."
"Unbroken."
"What is wrong with us?"
"@paulp has a branch for that."
"Think twice before you permute."

or really anything off one of the Scala t-shirts.
