OK, so with some more digging here's what I see.

The stringPrefix returns the first top-level object within the package.  That means it gives no meaningful information for nested constructs.
e.g. scala.collection.TraversableLikeTest$Foo$2$Bar => TraversableLikeTest

The REPL uses some interesting naming constructs
{code}
scala> b.getClass.getName.toCharArray
res16: Array[Char] = Array($, l, i, n, e, 3, ., $, r, e, a, d, $, $, i, w, $, $, i, w, $, B, a, r)
{code}

So due to pinching the text between the last '.' and the first '$' after we end up with "" because we have .$ in the internal representation.
