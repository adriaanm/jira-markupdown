Using Scala 2.8.0.r20873 on Java 1.6,

As discussed on mailing list: http://old.nabble.com/Scopes-td27568723.html.

Given the following sources:

A.scala
```scala
package P { object X }
package Q { object X }
```

B.scala
```scala
package P {
  object A {
    import Q._
    println("L7: " + X)
  }
}
```

The reference to X in P.A should be ambiguous because the wildcard import has lower precedence than the definition of P.X.  If the code is in a single file instead of two, scalac generates the proper error:

```scala
error: reference to X is ambiguous;
it is both defined in package P and imported subsequently by 
import Q._
      println("L7: " + X)
                       ^
```
(In r21155) Closes #3052 by changing the spec to reflect the compiler's behavior (which was quite intentionally the way it was). I am loath to go the other way; I fear it would break too much code. Review by community.
