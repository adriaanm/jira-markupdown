One cannot pass a java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap into any
of the existing scala.collections.jcl.* wrappers, so it would be
nice if Scala had a built in wrapper.
```scala
package scala.collection.jcl

class ConcurrentHashMap[K,E]
  (override val underlying : java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[K,E])
  extends scala.collection.jcl.MapWrapper[K,E]
{
  def this() = this(new java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[K,E])

  // java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap's do not support a clone
  // operation.
  override def clone() : Nothing = throw new CloneNotSupportedException
}
```
