I created a function like this:

```scala
def doit(implicit f: => Int) = i * 2
```

Of course in my actual program "doit" actually does something and only evaluates f occasionally.

The f parameter is implicit because I want callers to be able to use an implicit default value when they know that f will never actually be evaluated:

```scala
implicit val default = 0
```

Unfortunately there seems to be no way to create a val, var, or def in such a way that Scala will choose it as the implicit argument to doit.  I tried the following:

```scala
implicit def default = 0
implicit val default = { () => 0 }
implicit val default: => Int = 0
```

Of course the third one doesn't even compile.

If the compiler allows the creation of an implicit by-name parameter, then it should be willing to select an implicit argument for it.  If not, then it should be illegal to create the implicit by-name parameter in the first place.

(In r21196) Closes #2688 by disallowing call-by-name implicit parameters. No review.
see also r21197 which contains the change in specification.
