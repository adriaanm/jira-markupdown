I've dumped a bunch of tests in pending. They are:

```scala
pending/jvm5/t1464
pending/pos5/ilya2
pending/pos5/misc
```

These all fail for one or another reason when I try to run them via partest. misc and ilya2 seem to result in scalac trying to compile Java files thinking they're Scala ones. t1464 doesn't pick up the compiled Test file when partest tries to run it. 
The first two tests failed because of bugs in scalac's Java parser that are fixed in r16453. The third one has to do with parsing of annotations.

Note that it is correct behavior that scalac is given both the Scala and the Java files for compilation. This is needed to handle mutually dependent mixed Scala/Java sources. After scalac has processed these, the Java files are compiled with a regular Java compiler.

So, none of these tests failed because of problems in partest. Instead, they showed up there because partest lets scalac process also any existing Java files. Therefore, I'll close the ticket. For now I leave pos5/misc in pending. There should be a separate ticket filed against nsc.javac (scalac's Java parser).
