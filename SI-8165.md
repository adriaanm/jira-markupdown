I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it appears wrong. The `<<` operator (and likewise `>>`,`>>>`) fails to promote from Int to Long when the right operand is Long but the left one is Int. This is contrary to the behavior of `*`, `%`, etc., and contrary to Python, which does promote in this circumstance. This leads to unexpected overflow.

```scala
scala> val x:Int = 5
x: Int = 5

scala> val y:Long = 32
y: Long = 32

scala> x*y
res0: Long = 160

scala> x%y
res1: Long = 5

scala> x<<y
res2: Int = 0
```

Here is the Python equivalent:

```scala
Python 2.7.6 (default, Nov 18 2013, 15:12:51) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.2.79)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 32L
>>> x << y
21474836480L
```
"When in doubt, check what java does", that's the usual rule for those things.

The JLS says in [ยง15.19](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.19) that

*Binary numeric promotion (ยง5.6.2) is **not** performed on the operands.*

So Scala just does what Java does. I am not sure why Java does that though. 
@adriaanm

Should this issue be closed since it's acknowledged as not-a-bug?
```scala
scala> x << 32:Long
res7: Long = 5
```

This adds something peculiar.  It behaves differently when using a literal and a variable.
I'll look into it another time, either way, it seems there is a bug here.
#8462

BTW, (x << y: Long) is (x << y): Long not (x << (y: Long)).
