Needs a bit of minimization.
```scala
//package.scala
package object nodescala {
  def Foo: Int = 0
}
```
```scala
// NodeScalaSuite.scala
package nodescala

class NodeScalaSuite {
  Foo
}
```

This sort of problem means the `openPackageModule` hasn't been triggered, which adds the members of package objects to the package. I'm not sure if the presentation compiler test you created is even meant to to work, though: it doesn't look at `src/*`, does it? Poking around for source files that contain package objects is the domain of `BrowsingLoaders`.
