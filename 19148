Similar issue to SI-3265
filter is overridden in Stream whereas filterNot is implemented in TransversableLike.  This implementation is not working for Stream in 2.11.0 and 2.11.1.  It was working in previous versions (2.10.0 and 2.9.2 tested)

{code}
 scala> Stream.from(1).filter(_ > 5)
res2: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(6, ?)

scala> Stream.from(1).filterNot(_ <= 5)
