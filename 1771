I still think this is a bug.

If the API crashes unless the correct encoding is given then how can one use this API to read a file, while preserving unicode characters, if one doesn't know what encoding the file uses? If one doesn't specify an encoding then unicode characters are lost for pages that use them.

Also, even if it is correct to fail to read a URL unless the caller specifies the correct encoding then failing with an underflow exception seems to be the wrong behaviour.

I'm currently using the standard Java IO APIs from Scala and that works fine.
