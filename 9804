It seems reasonable that we should always perform exhaustiveness checking and simply ignore guards so we can report types which are definitely not covered. It's not ideal that there's no indication that exhaustiveness checking is not being performed if you add a guard somewhere; I don't think there's anything to be done about that though, as it would be super noisy to do so.

Actually like a lot of things, the useful warning would be issued at the point when you *change* the code, not as a consequence of the code when considered in isolation. ("Warning: the guard you just added disabled exhaustiveness checking.") That of course is not something which can be done in the compiler given present abilities.
