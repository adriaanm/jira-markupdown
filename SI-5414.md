Compiling the following,

{code}
object TupledAmbiguity {
  trait Base
  
  trait FooOps extends {
    def foo[T](t : T) = t
  }
  
  trait BarOps extends {
    def foo(s : String, i : Int) = (s, i)
  }
  
  implicit def baseFoo(b : Base) = new FooOps {}
  implicit def baseBar(b : Base) = new BarOps {}
  
  val b = new Base {}
  
  val f1 = b.foo(23)          // OK
  val f2 = b.foo("foo", 23)   // Ambiguous implicits
  val f3 = b.foo(("foo", 23)) // OK, explicit tuple
  
  def foo[T](t : T) = t
  def foo(s : String, i : Int) = (s, i)
  
  val f4 = foo(23)            // OK
  val f5 = foo("foo", 23)     // OK
}
{code}

Results in the following error being reported against the attempt to invoke BarOps#foo as a two argument method,

{code}
src/bugs/TupledAmbiguity.scala:20: error: type mismatch;
 found   : bugs.TupledAmbiguity.b.type (with underlying type Object with bugs.TupledAmbiguity.Base)
 required: ?{val foo(x$1: ?>: String("foo") <: Any,x$2: ?>: Int(23) <: Any): ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method baseBar in object TupledAmbiguity of type (b: bugs.TupledAmbiguity.Base)Object with bugs.TupledAmbiguity.BarOps
 and method baseFoo in object TupledAmbiguity of type (b: bugs.TupledAmbiguity.Base)Object with bugs.TupledAmbiguity.FooOps
 are possible conversion functions from bugs.TupledAmbiguity.b.type to ?{val foo(x$1: ?>: String("foo") <: Any,x$2: ?>: Int(23) <: Any): ?}
  val f2 = b.foo("foo", 23)   // Ambiguous implicits
           ^
one error found
{code}

The cause of the ambiguity is the application of automatic tupling to the argument list in the problematic call which creates a second candidate signature which resolves to FooOps#foo with T inferred as (String, Int). Is this a bug? If not, it's at least unfortunate and counterintuitive as the comparison with the analogous case of f4 and f5 where automatic tupling doesn't interfere with overload resolution.



The same problem and solution applies to default parameters.

{code}
object DefaultAmbiguity {
  trait Base
  
  trait FooOps extends {
    def foo[T](t : T) = t
  }
  
  trait BarOps extends {
    def foo(s : String, i : Int = 0) = (s, i)
  }
  
  implicit def baseFoo(b : Base) = new FooOps {}
  implicit def baseBar(b : Base) = new BarOps {}
  
  val b = new Base {}
  
  val f1 = b.foo(23)          // OK
  val f2 = b.foo("foo", 23)   // Ambiguous implicits
  
  def foo[T](t : T) = t
  def foo(s : String, i : Int = 0) = (s, i)
  
  val f4 = foo(23)            // OK
  val f5 = foo("foo", 23)     // OK
}
{code}
