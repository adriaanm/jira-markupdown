I'm downloaded the latest plugin yesterday and my PATH has this scala:
{code}
$$ scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.7.2.RC2 -- Copyright 2002-2008, LAMP/EPFL
$$ java -version
java version "1.6.0"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-b105)
{code}

on Windows XP Pro SP 2

In Eclispe 3.4 with the latest 2.7.2RC2 plugin, I have a Scala project (configured correctly - it compiles when I save, etc.),
when I select <project> -> right mouse button -> Scala -> Create scala interpreter in <project>
the Console window gets activated, appears to flash white
for a fraction of a second, then is filled with grey.
There is nothing it it
except a message right under the tab:
{code}
 No consoles to display at this time.
{code}

(see attached screenshot of the console and Error Log)

There is nothing in the Error log (no exceptions)
