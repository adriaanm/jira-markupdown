{{Iterator.toStream}} run through the whole Iterator at once, which both
defeats the purpose of Stream and also results in an infinite
loop when calling {{toStream}} on an infinite {{Iterator}}.

Reason: Currently, {{Iterator.toStream}} is inherited from
{{TraversableOnce.toStream}}, which is defined as

{code}
trait TraversableOnce[+A] {
  ...
  def toStream: Stream[A] = toList.toStream
  ...
}
{code}


Demonstration: The following script

{code}
class Numbers extends Iterator[Int] {
  var i = 0;
  def hasNext = true;
  def next = { println("DEBUG: next at " + i); i += 1; i }
}

val it = new Numbers
val s = it.toStream
s take(4) foreach println
{code}

yields the output

{code}
DEBUG: next at 0
DEBUG: next at 1
DEBUG: next at 2
DEBUG: next at 3
DEBUG: next at 4
DEBUG: next at 5
DEBUG: next at 6
... (runs forever) ...
{code}


Proposed solution: Give {{Iterator}} a dedicated implementation of
{{toStream}} which fits the nature of {{Stream}}, e.g. like this:

{code}
trait {{Iterator[+A]}} extends TraversableOnce[A] {
  self =>
  ...
  override def toStream: Stream[A] =
    if (self.hasNext) Stream.cons(self.next, self.toStream)
    else Stream.empty[A]
  ...
}
{code}
Demonstration:

{code}
class Numbers extends Iterator[Int] {
  var i = 0;
  def hasNext = true;
  def next = { println("DEBUG: next at " + i); i += 1; i }
}

def toStream[A](it: Iterator[A]): Stream[A] =
  if (it.hasNext) Stream.cons(it.next, toStream(it))
  else Stream.empty[A]

val it = new Numbers
val s = toStream(it)
s take(4) foreach println
{code}

produces the output

{code}
DEBUG: next at 0
1
DEBUG: next at 1
2
DEBUG: next at 2
3
DEBUG: next at 3
4
{code}


Since lazy behaviour is the very purpose of {{Stream}} and also both infinite
Streams and Iterators are explicitly allowed, I propose to classify
this as a defect.

I'd vote to include this in 2.8.0.RC4, if accepted.

(In r22115) Make Iterator.toStream be properly lazy.  Closes SI-3516, review by prokopec.
