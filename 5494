Scala 2.10.0-M3 includes type tags (which may be renamed by the time 2.10.0-final hits). Type tags are thin wrappers over compiler's Types, which means that they support all intricacies of Scala's type system.

Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0-20120527-185059-965b03e100 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_25).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> typeOf[{ def x: Int }]
res0: reflect.runtime.universe.Type = java.lang.Object{def x: scala.Int}
{code}

Type tags are now a recommended way to reify types, and manifests are deprecated. Hence we won't implement any new functionality for manifests.
