This bug appears to still exist in 2.8.0.RC7 and it's a show stopper for me. 'scala' is ignoring both -cp and -classpath flags. 

It doesn't help to invoke the interpreter using the raw java command embedded in the script, with different permutations of classpaths:

env CLASSPATH=<...> java  -cp <...>:/Library/tools/scala/scala/lib/scala-compiler.jar:/Library/tools/scala/scala/lib/scala-library.jar -Dscala.home=$$SCALA_HOME -Denv.classpath=<...> scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner <script>

Note: at the very least, the 'scala' script should pass '-cp "$$TOOL_CLASSPATH:$$CLASSPATH"'.

For your convenience, here's the scala file and script I used:

1) mkdir build
2) scalac -d build Foo.scala:

where Foo.scala is:

package foo
class Foo(name:String)

3) scala -cp build script.scala

where script.scala is:

val f = new foo.Foo("f")
println(f.name)
