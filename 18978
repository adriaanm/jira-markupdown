I really want to make value discarding warnings fatal as I have hit many bugs in production because of it. Sadly, we have a few things we're using deprecated (I do not care about those, for the moment) - so when I run:

{noformat}
$ ./qbin/scala -Xfatal-warnings
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20140312-105634-9c38e86a55 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> @deprecated("Bad", "1.0") def addOne(x: Int) = { x + 1 }
addOne: (x: Int)Int

scala> addOne(2)
error: there were 1 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
{noformat}

I have not turned on the {{-deprecation}} flag, so I do not expect an error to occur. Can we make this be a warning until that flag is turned on?
