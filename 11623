Correct, if you say {{break(outer)}} instead of {{break(inner, outer)}}, it doesn't have any scoping knowledge to say "oh, I should probably also break out of {{inner}} as well."    It would be pretty easy to support something like {{inner <- breakable(data)(outer)}}, so that {{outer}} could know to halt {{inner}} if it was broken.  But that isn't enforceable either, of course.  I could maintain a stack internal to {{BreakableGenerators}}. I'd have to think through whether that causes any concurrency-safety issues.  Past that, it's getting into compiler support, I think.
