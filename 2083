Thrilled as I would be were it otherwise, never in my life have instructions which involved maven allowed me to reproduce a bug, and the perfect record still stands.

[ERROR] BUILD ERROR

Missing:
----------
1) org.scala-lang:scala-library:jar:2.8.0

  Try downloading the file manually from the project website.

  Then, install it using the command: 
      mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.scala-lang -DartifactId=scala-library -Dversion=2.8.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file

  Alternatively, if you host your own repository you can deploy the file there: 
      mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=org.scala-lang -DartifactId=scala-library -Dversion=2.8.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file -Durl=[url] -DrepositoryId=[id]

But please don't tell me how to work around that.  You have to subtract maven from the equation if you want to report a scalac bug.

> If you want me to export the project and attach it I can do that.

No, absolutely not.  What I would like is for you to paste the shortest possible self-contained test case which reproduces the issue.  If you are able to determine the revision which introduced the issue, that too would be very helpful (but without a self-contained test case I can't verify a fix.)
