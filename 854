If nobody writes an analogue patch for .NET, it would still be possible to implement the clone() method in scala.Array using a loop. While not fast, this would at least work (for 2.8).
```scala
def clone():Array[A] = {
  val r = new Array[A](this.length);
  for(i <- 0 until this.length){
    r(i) = this(i);
  }
  r
}
```
