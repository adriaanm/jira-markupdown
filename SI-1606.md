Eclipse Version: 3.4.1

Build id: M20080911-1700

Scala plugin, 2.7.3.RC1

Scala seems to be inventing spurious package prefixes that aren't there on the imported class, then complains that they are bogus.

Copied from the Eclipse problems pane:
```scala
Description                                          Resource             Path                                                       Location	    Type
value lang is not a member of package com.sun.java   Modifiers.java       PFC/ProjectFortress/src/com/sun/fortress/nodes_util        Unknown        Scala Problem
```
For the source line
```scala
import static java.lang.Math.*;
```

Second example:

```scala
Description                                                                                   Resource                  Path                                                            Location  Type
SubtypeHistory is not a member of _root_.com.sun.fortress.compiler.typechecker.TypeAnalyzer   ConstraintFormula.java	PFC/ProjectFortress/src/com/sun/fortress/compiler/typechecker   Unknown   Scala Problem
```
For the source line
```scala
import com.sun.fortress.compiler.typechecker.TypeAnalyzer.SubtypeHistory;
```

This seems perhaps similar to bug #1277, except that this is Java code, not Scala code.  


Further info: the claimed "error" does not inhibit running the debugger, and the file that is claimed to contain the error, appears to be "ok" -- references to its members appear in the debugged code, and they appear correct.

Can you provide some guidance on using the command line tools to do this?  This is part of a large project; another member of the team has started working in Scala, and so now we have Scala code to compile, but I have never written a line of Scala code, nor have I ever run the Scala compiler outside of the build system.

We DO compile it all regularly with ant, and it seems to work there.

If you want to take a shot at this yourself

```scala
svn checkout https://projectfortress.sun.com/svn/Community/trunk PF
cd PF
ant compileAll
```

It is, in theory, also configured as an Eclipse project, ready to go with the scala plugin; however, Eclipse is not configured to do all the building, so the first step after checking out the project in Eclipse is `ant compileAll` in a console window, followed by "Project > Clean..." in Eclipse.  Before adding the scala plugin, a simple Refresh was sufficient, but now it isn't.  Another bug, perhaps?
