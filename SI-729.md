As a temporary workaround (on waiting for real art design), it may be handy to replace Scala plugin icon with something smaller, less contrast and less saturated. Possible icon variant is attached.
hi anli, any drafts on including a simple 'S' into icon eclipse uses for java files.  I my personal opinion the icon is still too loud.

The icon is now similar to the one for Java files ... a document with a small 'S'.
