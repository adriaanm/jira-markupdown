I am about to fix this bug. I have resolved the problem of keywords and literals like {{null}}, {{false}} and {{true}}. After having read the SIP-11 again, I have also decided not to support backquoted identifiers (but they can still be written in a block).

The final question I have is whether to support {{$this}} or not. SIP-11 specifies the simpler escape sequence as the ‘$’-sign followed by an identifier consisting only of alphanumeric characters, and that {{$id}} is equivalent to {{$\{id\}}}. Strictly speaking, {{this}} is not an identifier, but probably it might be useful to write $this in an interpolated string. What is your expectation?
