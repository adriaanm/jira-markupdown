For some subtypes of Seq calling the constructor without an argument will return Seq.empty (e.g. RandomAccessSeq). 
For other subtyes (such as List or RichString) this does not happen. These sequences then -- although empty -- are not equal to Seq.empty. This leads to unexpetected behaviour of e.g. match clauses that use Seq.empty as a constant pattern.
Cf. this discussion on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/740660/why-does-the-empty-string-not-match-as-seq-empty
After a longish discussion, we think this behavior is surprising, but not a bug. 

The first issue is that a pattern `case Seq() =>` is a sequence pattern that matches *any* empty sequence. On the other hand, `Seq.empty` returns *some specific* default implementation of sequences, and it happens to be a mutable sequence. 

The second issue is that for mutable sequences `equals` is reference equality (there's a long thread on the mailing list about equality for mutable data structures), therefore `Seq.empty` can't match *any* empty sequence.
