Given an abstract method defined in a trait.
Given a concrete class extending that trait.
Then the omission of an implementation of the abstract method in the concrete class is tolerated by the compiler as long as the abstract method in the trait is overriding a concrete method.
It is the case in the code.  TheClass implements toString() the same way most things do, by inheriting it from Object.  You aren't making the concrete Object implementation vanish by declaring an abstract toString().
