```scala
15:46 ~/Projects/Kepler_snippet01/build/pack/bin (topic/snippet01)$
cat Test.scala
package foo

class C
15:46 ~/Projects/Kepler_snippet01/build/pack/bin (topic/snippet01)$ ./
scalac Test.scala
15:46 ~/Projects/Kepler_snippet01/build/pack/bin (topic/snippet01)$ ./
scalap foo.C
class/object foo.C not found.
```

In Scala 2.9.2 working directory is included in classpath by default. Therefore it's a regression.
