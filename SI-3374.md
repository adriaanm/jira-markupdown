```scala
trait Parent {
 type Test[A, H[B <: A]]
}
trait Sub extends Parent {
 type Test[A, H[B <: A]] = A
}
```

should type check, but instead complains:

```scala
Top.scala:5: The kind of type Test does not conform to the expected kind of
type Test[A,H[B <: A]] in trait Parent.
Sub.this.Test's type parameters do not match type Test's expected parameters:
type B (in trait Sub)'s bounds >: Nothing <: A are stricter than type B (in
trait Parent)'s declared bounds >: Nothing <: A
 type Test[A, H[B <: A]] = A
      ^
```

the problem is likely in this line in Infer.scala:
```scala
if (!(transform(hkparam.info.instantiateTypeParams(tparams, targs).bounds.substSym(hkparams, hkargs), paramowner) <:< transform(hkarg.info.bounds, owner)))
```
(In r22512) closes #3374. checkKindBoundsHK did not instantiate hk params far enough. see also neg/bug1275
review by odersky
(In r22754) closes #3419: test files

omit check that wouldn't work with separate compilation,
not needed anymore because compiler has become more robust

the actual fix was committed as part of r22512, see #3374

also see #3512
