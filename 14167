Particular eclipse version: 3.5M6.

Particular scala plugin version:   Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r17520-b20090417023210	ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.feature.group

I think I have seen this in other versions of Eclipse and the Scala plugin, especially recent previous plugin nightlies.

1. In Eclipse, open a scala file with errors.

2. Build/refresh as necessary to get the Plugin to show the errors.

3. Open the Problems "view" (Window > Show View > Problems)

4. Scroll down to the Scala problems, compare to any Java problems that might be handy.

The Java problems have line numbers, the Scala problems do not.
However, the information is clearly semantically available, because double-clicking on an error line takes you to the error in question.

This lack of a line number also affects sort order -- though the information is somewhere "behind the curtain", it is not made available to the sort.

The attached GIF shows:
 * that Scala Problems have no location
 * that Java Problems do have a location
 * that the sort order is not correct; the "last" Scala problem is not the "last" problem in the file.
 * that the results of a double-click did take me to the right location; the information is there, it is just not revealed in the Problems view or to the sort.

If you do not have access to any Scala bugs, you can check some out at
```scala
svn checkout https://projectfortress.sun.com/svn/Community/trunk PFC
```

or you can download a [https://projectfortress.sun.com/Projects/Community/downloads/8 35 MB prebuilt zip file]

In both cases, be aware that the command line build uses 2.7.2, but since getting a correct build is not actually required to demonstrate this problem, this detail is probably not relevant.  The problems shown in this picture are those reported by the 2.8.0 plugin.
