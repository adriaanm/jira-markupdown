To elaborate a little: `(b: Parent[TypeArg])Unit` is not applicable to an argument of type `Child[_]`, so the second alternative is not 'as specific' as the first. Same story in the the opposite direction. So ambiguity is duly reported.

The relevant part of the spec is in section 6.2.3
{code}
A parameterized method `m` of type `(p1:T1,...,pn:Tn)U` is as specific as 
some other member `m′` of type `S` if `m′` is applicable to arguments 
`(p1, ..., pn )` of types `T1, ..., Tn.`
{code}
