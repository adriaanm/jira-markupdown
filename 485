Yeah, this seems to work fine now.
Foo.java:
```scala
class Foo implements Comparable {
  public int compareTo(Object that) {
    return 0;
  }
}
```
Bar.scala:
```scala
class Bar extends Foo {
  val x = this.compareTo(new AnyRef)
}
```
Reopen if you have a self-contained example that still doesn't work.
