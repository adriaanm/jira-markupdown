Yeah, this seems to work fine now.
Foo.java:
{code}
class Foo implements Comparable {
  public int compareTo(Object that) {
    return 0;
  }
}
{code}
Bar.scala:
{code}
class Bar extends Foo {
  val x = this.compareTo(new AnyRef)
}
{code}
Reopen if you have a self-contained example that still doesn't work.
