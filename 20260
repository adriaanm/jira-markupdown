The creation of  a method in the REPL like e.g. 

{code:scala}
def foo(in: Int): String = ???
{code}

will result in an output like 

{code}
foo: (in: Int)String
{code}

which is almost (but not quite!) valid Scala syntax and therefore rather confusing.

Instead the output should
- valid scala syntax
- and maybe a helpful message that and what happened.
