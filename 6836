It's a head scratcher. I've attached a screenshot from the debugger that shows the type history of the method, second time around.
```scala
TypeHistory(posterasure:3,(argWithDefault: String)Unit,TypeHistory(tailcalls:3,(argWithDefault: String)Unit,TypeHistory(namer:5,(argWithDefault$1: String)Unit,null)))
```
