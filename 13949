This one should be legit :)

As posted on http://www.nabble.com/Bug-in-scala.swing.Table--td21135472.html#a21136906
The Table implementation breaks the contract of the Model View System. When you drag a column around in a table the contents switch, and the header does not match the contents (as in scala.swing.test.UIDemo)

The JTable converts the index:

http://kickjava.com/src/javax/swing/JTable.java.htmSI-1902
```scala
public void setValueAt(Object JavaDoc aValue, int row, int column) {
      getModel().getValueAt(row, convertColumnIndexToModel(column));
}
```



while the override does not:
```scala
    override def getValueAt(r: Int, c: Int) = Table.this.apply(r,c).asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
```

This one is easy to fix, but it has to be fixed in several places otherwise it only gets worse...
