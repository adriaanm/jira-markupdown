Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
  
// expected
scala> var x = Iterator(1, 2)
x: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> x.toList
res17: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> x.toList
res18: List[Int] = List()

// not so expected
scala> var x = Iterable(1,2).iterator
x: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> x.toList
res19: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> x.toList
res20: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

// even less expected
scala> x.toStream
res21: Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> x.toStream
res22: Stream[Int] = Stream(2, ?)

scala> x.toStream
res23: Stream[Int] = Stream()

// back to expected
scala> var x = Iterable(1,2).iterator
x: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> x.toSet
res24: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(1, 2)

scala> x.toSet
res25: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set()
{code}

for the `toList` one, `LinearSeqLike` implements `iterator` as follows:

{code}
  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
    var these = self
 ...
    override def toList: List[A] = these.toList
  }
{code}
Interesting consequence of stream's nonlazyinheadiness.  Doubt we can do anything about it, but it's unfortunate because toStream fails in two ways, relative to what you'd want, or I'd want anyway.

1) I want calling toStream to reserve the iterator for that stream.  Off limits to anyone else.  But of course, without forcing its evaluation.

2) I want calling toStream to communicate my desire to memoize the iterator, but without evaluating any elements.

{code}
iterator 
it: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> val s1 = it.toStream
s1: Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> val s2 = it.toStream
s2: Stream[Int] = Stream(2, ?)

scala> s1 foreach println
1
3
4

scala> s2 foreach println
2

(In r23019) Does what can probably be done about strange iterator exhaustion
behavior.  Maybe we should start thinking about iteratees...
Closes SI-3760, no review.
{code:title=AnotherInconsistency.scala}
    val it = Stream("a", "b", "c").map { letter =>
      println("map " + letter)
      letter
    }.iterator

    println("hasNext")
    it.hasNext
    println("next " + it.next())
    println("hasNext")
    it.hasNext
    println("next " + it.next())
    println("hasNext")
    it.hasNext
    println("next " + it.next())
{code}
Actual Output :
{code}
map a
hasNext
next a
hasNext
map b
next b
hasNext
map c
next c
{code}

Expected outout: 
{code}
hasNext
map a
next a
hasNext
map b
next b
hasNext
map c
next c
{code}

It is totally unexpected that the Head element is treated differently than the others, from the user point of view it feels like operations are not executed lazily on the head element, because they are executed before the actual iterator.hasNext method call.
Although this works as expected 
{code}
    val it = Stream("a", "b", "c").iterator.map { letter =>
      println("map " + letter)
      letter
    }
{code}
