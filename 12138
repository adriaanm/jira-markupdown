So I was thinking of having a look at this. The last option seems to be fairly easy to implement. How would this look?


{code:scala}
object Boo {
  /**
   * @hideImplicitConversion
   */
  implicit class BooCharIsFoo(boo: Boo[Char]) extends Foo[Char]
}
{code}

What I mean by this is: that we would want to hide each implicit conversion explicitly - not all of them right?
