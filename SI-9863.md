{code:scala}
object A {
  implicit class Imp(i: Int) {
    def myPrint() {
      println(i)
    }
  }
}

object B {
  implicit class Imp(i: String) {
    def myPrint() {
      println(i)
    }
  }
}

import A._
import B._

object MyApp extends App {
  3.myPrint()
}
{code}
This fails with

{code}value myPrint is not a member of Int{code}

It is all explained in this SO:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22105881/scala-multiple-implicit-conversions-with-same-name
This is working as designed, and it's a pretty fundamental aspect of Scala's design. So I'm going to close the ticket, but places you could reach out to explore possible alternate designs include scala-language group, the SIP process, the SI-9510 ticket, etc.
Hi [~sethtisue],

I understand that "this is a fundamental aspect of Scala's design", but could you please give a short explanation or point us to the part of the Scala spec where this is specified?

I've come across this Jira (and the SO question) after Googling for "scala implicit with the same name", but so far I still don't know why two implicits with the same name are ignored.
I went (very quickly, I might have missed something) through Scala's specification chapter 7 about implicits (http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/07-implicits.html)
and did not find anything related to having multiple implicits with the same name.

The only clue I've found so far is someone in the SO comments saying that "That's a feature not a bug, because it's how you disable implicits that might be in scope".
When I searched for "scala disabling implicit", I did not find much more, but I found that you can disable implicits by renaming them like that "import myImplicit => _".

When two implicits with the same name and different signature exist, why doesn't the compiler at least throw a warning, rather than silently ignoring them?

I apologize if I just did not search deep enough, but I believe this JIRA should not be closed without giving a proper answer to the question.
Hopefully, that way, the next guy asking the same question will not spend as much time as I did to find the answer.

Thanks

Thanks, 
I found some more material: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/scala-language/implicit$20same$20name|sort:relevance/scala-language/Q5nn-vi4tCU/FLx8fowgTHUJ
and this http://scalapuzzlers.com/#pzzlr-033

I finally understood that in this example, B.Imp is shadowing A.Imp, regardless of it's signature.
So Imp(i: Int) is not available because it has been shadowed by Imp(i : String).

and replacing 
{code}
import A._
import B._
{code}

with 

{code}
import B._
import A._
{code}

would have worked.

Now, why the shadowing works on the name without the signature, I do not know, and I think there is matter to discussion, but I agree this is another debate. 

I will comment the SO as well.
