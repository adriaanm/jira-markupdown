One of the things blocking Spark from fully working with Scala 2.11 is that we depend on a JLine version that has conflicts with the version bundled with Scala 2.11. It is difficult for us to change our dependency since it comes from a third party library.

To fix this it would be great if there could be a 2.11 patch that shades this dependency during packaging of Scala. I discussed this a bit with Iulian and he seemed to think it was doable. 
I strongly believe the real solution here is to find agreement on the version of jline to use.

We've spent a lot of time going back to plain vanilla jline, and it's already paid off in getting bugs fixed upstream (https://github.com/jline/jline2/pull/175) by way of reports here (SI-8759), and the other way around (every bugfix to upstream ever). We're not in the business of maintaining third party libraries, and I really feel we should not do so, unless all other alternatives have been exhausted.

The short term solution (just fork it) may be easy to implement right now, but the cost of these things should be considered over the lifetime of the dependency.
A bit more background info:

Spark builds against these dependencies ([~pwendell], let me know if I missed something):

- Hive 0.13.1, [which links to jline 0.9.94|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-0.13.1/pom.xml#L120]
- Hive 0.12.0, where I couldn't find the jline dependency version (it's an ant + ivy build), but it's safe to assume it's even older

Hive master seems to be on jline 2.12, which is the same as Scala.

While running `sbt evicted`, this shows up, confirming the dependency conflict:

{code}
[warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
[warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
[warn] 	* jline:jline:0.9.94 -> 2.12.1
[warn] Run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings
{code}
Just a quick update on this, Adriaan's been looking at using some reflection magic to provide a shaded jar but also the "usual" one, and decide at runtime which one to use. Clients then can either provide their own or rely on the default.

[~moors], would you describe your approach here? It'd be good to hear how this fits the intended usage.
