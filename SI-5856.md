{code}
scala> class C { s"$this" }
<console>:7: error: not found: value this
       class C { s"$this" }
                    ^

scala> class C { val q = this; s"$q" }
defined class C
{code}


Also works:

{code}
class C { s"${this}" }
{code}
should {{$yield}} and {{$extends}} not be allowed? Consider
{code}
scala> val `yield` = 1
yield: Int = 1

scala> val `extends` = 2
extends: Int = 2

scala> s"$yield / $extends"
res23: String = 1 / 2
{code}

Or do you expect that one should have to write
{code}
scala> s"$`yield`"
<console>:1: error: invalid string interpolation
       s"$`yield`"
{code}
(which currently issues an error message), as in
{code}
scala> s"${`yield` + `extends`}"
res24: String = 3
{code}
?
I am about to fix this bug. I have resolved the problem of keywords and literals like {{null}}, {{false}} and {{true}}. After having read the SIP-11 again, I have also decided not to support backquoted identifiers (but they can still be written in a block).

The final question I have is whether to support {{$this}} or not. SIP-11 specifies the simpler escape sequence as the ‘$’-sign followed by an identifier consisting only of alphanumeric characters, and that {{$id}} is equivalent to {{$\{id\}}}. Strictly speaking, {{this}} is not an identifier, but probably it might be useful to write $this in an interpolated string. What is your expectation?

Actually, I would just leave it as is and require the use of braces. If I had to allow one, it would be {{$this}}.
