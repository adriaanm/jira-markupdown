As a sidenote, removing {{val key = 4}} also removes the {{VerifyError}}: the emitted bytecode contains two code sections, one for the try-clause and another for the catch-clause (both doing the same, ie building an {{ObjectRef}} with {{null}} as payload). In this case, there's no {{VerifyError}} because on control-flow merge those stacks have same height.
