Working on a patch for javac.target options.   Not as easy as you would hope....

Also, I kinda think perhaps scalac.args for JVM target should only be for scalac.args.quickonly, so we don't run into STARR vs. locker feature issues (those **are** my favorite).

I should have something by the end of the week.
