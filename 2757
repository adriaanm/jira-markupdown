minimal testcase:
```scala
object Test {
  def meh(xs: List[Any]) {
    xs map { x =>  (new AnyRef {}) }
  }
}
```

{{
fatal: $$anon has owner meh, but a class owner is required
owners: method meh.object Test.package <empty>.package <root>
{code}

note that it's the anonymous inner class `AnyRef{}` that triggers the assert
