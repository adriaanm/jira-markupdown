The interpreter should handle this.  The given expression is not only valid, but something that users are likely to try.  If nothing else, the existing special case for individual expressions can be expanded so as to include this use case.

A partial fix is in the attachment interpAddsSemi-r16705.patch.  All it does is insert a semicolon before the user code, thus avoiding any attempt by the parser to treat the user code as a this alias.  This patch does not work due to issue scala/bug#1565, but if scala/bug#1565 can be fixed it should work.  If scala/bug#1565 needs to stay the way it is for some reason, then there are alternate strategies available for 1564.
