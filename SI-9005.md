{{tail}} is supposed to produce a new collection that doesn't depend on mutation of the existing one.  So is {{drop}}.  Not so with {{Queue}}:

{code}
scala> import scala.collection.mutable.Queue
import scala.collection.mutable.Queue

scala> val q = Queue(1,2,3)
q: scala.collection.mutable.Queue[Int] = Queue(1, 2, 3)

scala> val r = q.tail
r: scala.collection.mutable.Queue[Int] = Queue(2, 3)

scala> q.enqueue(4)

scala> r
res1: scala.collection.mutable.Queue[Int] = Queue(2, 3, 4)

scala> val s = q.drop(1)
s: scala.collection.mutable.Queue[Int] = Queue(2, 3, 4)

scala> q.enqueue(5)

scala> s
res3: scala.collection.mutable.Queue[Int] = Queue(2, 3, 4, 5)
{code}

This is a deeper problem than it might initially appear, as {{Queue}} is a {{LinearSeq}}, which means that it is supposed to have an efficient tail.  But of course it can't in the face of mutation.  So to fix this would require non-negligible reworking of the class hierarchy or painstaking overriding of methods that expect efficient tail.

This is not true of e.g. {{ArrayBuffer}}: tail really does create another collection.

My best idea presently is to create a marker trait for mutable collections that produce collections that are mutably entangled with the original.  Then at least you have some chance at detecting that everything is screwy.
One can take the {{MutableList}} approach to partly rescue the behavior: assume that there won't be any change in the middle and use a counter to avoid running off the end.  Note that {{MutableList.iterator}} is also broken because it doesn't catch the potentially shorter tail.  Also, everyone's vulnerable to {{update}} changing elements in the middle.
Because the difference in efficiency is O(n) vs O(n^2), which is basically the difference between "works" and "hangs" for anything big, and `LinearSeq`'s contract is _specifically_ to have an efficient tail, I think giving up on that is pretty abhorrent.

Deprecating the entire class sounds reasonable.  If I had finished the bytecode scanning stuff I'd know usage stats for it, but I don't ATM.
note that over in SI-9068 we're deprecating mutable.Stack as a result of similar problems
