in both 2.9 and 2.10.0-M4:

```scala
scala> import sys.process._
import sys.process._

scala> "foo".lines
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("foo")
 required: ?{def lines: ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method augmentString in object Predef of type (x: String)scala.collection.immutable.StringOps
 and method stringToProcess in trait ProcessImplicits of type (command: String)scala.sys.process.ProcessBuilder
 are possible conversion functions from String("foo") to ?{def lines: ?}
              "foo".lines
              ^
```

I'm working around it by writing {code}stringToProcess("foo").lines{code}, but I have a sad.
I'm not sure this is worth pursuing. Process implicits are not default, and "lines" works if you use the `Process` factories. That is, this works:

```scala
    Process("foo").lines
```

And if you want to use `lines` with `String`, don't import `sys.process._`.
If you want the one on StringOps, do not import `sys.process._`. If you use the `Process` factory, there's no need to import those implicits.

But, yeah, `getLines` makes sense. I'd support that, though, of couse, we need to go through deprecation period.
"if you use the Process factory, there's no need to import those implicits" — hmm, mrggh, grumble grumble grumble. there is **less** need. there are a lot of implicits in this API, and the current documentation leans on them heavily. it's pretty much assumed that "import sys.process._" is the standard way to use the API.
I double checked and all implicits I can find are `Source` and `Sink` factories, mostly `ProcessBuilder` (which is both `Source` and `Sink`), with some specialized stuff. I then looked at object `Process` and all of them seem to be available there.

Now, I plead guilty on the over-emphasis on the implicit conversions in the documentation. In my flimsy defence, I plead that adding `Process()` everywhere makes for long lines and makes the code ugly. I'll grant that I should have make it very clear -- and with examples -- that you can do all of that without the implicits.
