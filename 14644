On Windows, scala interpreter does not show caret(or cursor) during left/right arrow keys are pressed.

Suppose I typing like below.

scala> println("Helo scala"

Caret is end of line.
When I try to go back few chars to correct "Helo" to "Hello", scala interpreter does not showing caret, during left arrow key pressed down. 

I can't see where I am now during move around in line. 
I hope this to be fixed.  


Environment:
 -Windows XP SP3
 -Scala 2.7.7 final (I tried with some build of 2.8, but situation does not seems to fixed)
