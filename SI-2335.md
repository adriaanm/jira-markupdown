I read somewhere that all sequences with the same elements were supposed to be 'equal'.  The code for the 'equals' method in collection.immutable.Queue doesn't appear to be doing that.  And it's definitely not symmetric, as shown below.

import scala.collection.immutable._
val q = Queue(1,2,3)  
val lst = List(1,2,3)
lst == q
   res9: Boolean = true
q == lst
   res10: Boolean = false
