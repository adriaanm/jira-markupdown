Details came from https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-4504#comment=27-1913754

It compiles and runs with 'override implicit' or 'implicit override', but 'override implicit' should not be allowed based on the spec. https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#class-definitions

```scala
object HelloWorld {

  case class SomeInt(x: Int)
  abstract class Base(val someInt: SomeInt)
  case class Sample(path: String)( override implicit val someInt: SomeInt) extends Base(someInt) // line of interest

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val someString = "123"
    implicit val aNumber = SomeInt(5)

    val sample = Sample(someString)

    print(sample.path)
  }
}
```

```

It looks like scalac doesn't follow language specification in this particular case:
https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#class-definitions

implicit modifier relates to the whole class parameter clause, and override is part of a single class parameter. I would rather add an error highlighting to such usage.
```
