According to the javadoc, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html is a Hashtable[Object, Object], yet the conversion tries to view it as a Map[String, String]
```scala
  implicit def propertiesAsScalaMapConverter(p: ju.Properties): AsScala[mutable.Map[String, String]] =
    new AsScala(propertiesAsScalaMap(p))
```
