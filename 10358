See also my last comment on SI-8071, written two years ago tomorrow. "But SI-8079 doesn't. Just a reminder that it is easy to fix. Java 8 is out and has a lot going for it. One thing scala can do to assist in its survival is offer nicer wrappers around java 8. It has to be possible to write them though."
