Just to add that the discussion that led up to that PR is here: scala/bug#9594.

Basically ListSet and ListMap had behaviors different from each other in Scala 2.11.8, and some operations did not preserve that order. The PR made sure the same consistent order was kept, even after map/filter operations, and that ListSet and ListMap had the same ordering guarantees.
