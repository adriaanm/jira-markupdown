It would be useful to have the ability to create a Map from a Set and a mapping function:

    val cities = Set("London", "Paris", "Munich")
    cities.mapTo(_.length) //Map(london -> 6, Paris -> 5, Munich ->6)

A dumb scala 2.7 impl on Set[K] would be like:

  def mapTo[V](f : K => V) : Map[K, V] = (Map[K,V]() /: this) { (m, k) => m + (k -> f(k))
  }

Again, this is something that I expected to see in Scala 2.8 but cannot find it.
```scala
scala> Map(Set("London", "Paris", "Munich").toSeq map {x => (x, x.length)} : _*)
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Map[java.lang.String,Int] = Map(London -> 6, Paris -> 5, Munich -> 6)
```

see also #2604...
it's still a duplicate
if we solve #2604, we will do it in a way that also solves #2605 -- I don't see the point of having two different tickets for this

I really don't get how this is a duplicate. My mapBy (suggestion #2604) turns a Traversable[Value] into a Map[Key, Value] by extracting a key from each traversed element (and throwing an exception if multiple elements map to the same key)

This (#2605) is a separate function mapTo which turns a Set[Key] into a Map[Key, Value] by extracting a value from each member of the Set.

Admittedly they are related, but they are NOT equivalent. I'm opening this again (don't mean to cause any offence)
