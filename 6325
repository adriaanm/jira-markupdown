It was made protected, not removed. It can be overridden with a public modifier at the Set level, if needed, but there's the question of the return type. I don't like `find` because that method has another type signature, and method overloads are best avoided. I'd pick an unused name, but, again, I think that's a discussion that must happen elsewhere, such as scala-debate or scala-language.
