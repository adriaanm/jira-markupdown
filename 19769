If a package named scala that is not the root scala package is in scope, *root*.scala.reflect.runtime.universe.typeTag fail with a "No TypeTag available for T" exception, where T is the type argument. An example of T is String. I suspect that other reflection methods have the same problem.

The attached project demonstrates the problem.
