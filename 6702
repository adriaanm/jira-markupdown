(ureche in [r26048|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26048]) Changed the way use cases are handled in scaladoc.
    
If use cases are present, the original member disappears from the list. References SI-5054, but needs more work on the html part.
If use cases are present along with links, scaladoc doesn't crash anymore. Closes SI-4898.
