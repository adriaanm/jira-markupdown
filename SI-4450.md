=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? 

In the example below, I calculated the commentStr so to not to be recalculated every time the returned function evaluated. It seems to required extra newline or ; delimiter to compile. Is this according to lang spec?

===
```scala
  
object Z {
  val clientInfo = "XX"
  val key = "YY"
  
  class A {
    val debugOn = false
    
    def doesNotCompile(v: Double) {
      val debugOp: (Double)=>Unit = 
	if (debugOn) {
	  val commentStr = clientInfo + ":" + key + " "
	  { v => println(commentStr + v) }
	}
	else 
	  { v => () }
    }
 // Compiler complains missing parameter type
    //[error] 	  { v => println(commentStr + v) }
    // but adding type of v does not help





    // Just a newline will make it compile
    def doesCompile1(v: Double) {
      val debugOp: (Double)=>Unit = 
	if (debugOn) {
	  val commentStr = clientInfo + ":" + key + " "	  

	  { v => println(commentStr + v) }
	}
	else 
	  { v => () }
    }

    // or a ;
    def doesCompile2(v: Double) {
      val debugOp: (Double)=>Unit = 
	if (debugOn) {
	  val commentStr = clientInfo + ":" + key + " ";
	  { v => println(commentStr + v) }
	}
	else 
	  { v => () }
    }


    // Replace { } with ( ) in around return value
    def doesCompile3(v: Double) {
      val debugOp: (Double)=>Unit = 
	if (debugOn) {
	  val commentStr = clientInfo + ":" + key + " "	  
	  ( v => println(commentStr + v) )
	}
	else 
	  { v => () }
    }

  }
}
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
I would expect an extra newline should not make a difference.

=== What do you see instead? ===
I would expect an extra newline should not make a difference.

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC1, 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: OS X 
As usual it's necessary a minimal example. In this case, it's like: 

```scala
object Ticket4450 {
  def f: (Double)=>Unit = {
    val s = " ";
    { v: Double => println() }
  }
}
```

Yes, a semicolon or a newline is needed before the function value. That's not a bug.
