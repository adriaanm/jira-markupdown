In the attached screenshot, debugging Scala 2.10.2-RC1, you can see the call stack shows 

{noformat}
resetAllAttrs():37, Global {scala.tools.nsc}
adaptToImplicitMethod$1():870, Typers$Typer {scala.tools.nsc.typechecker}
{noformat}

I expect:

{noformat}
resetAllAttrs():37, Global {scala.tools.nsc}
adaptToImplicitMethod$1():881, Typers$Typer {scala.tools.nsc.typechecker}
{noformat}

Where line 881 is in the inlined lambda.
Here's a standalone test case. The same line number information is emitted in 2.10.0 as 2.10.2-RC1.

{code}
class Test {
  @inline final def foo[A](a: => A) = a

  def client {
    foo {
      println("line 6")
    }
  }
}
{code}

With {{-optimize}}, nothing on line 6.
{noformat}
  scala> :javap -v Test

     public void client();
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=1
   0:  getstatic  #28; //Field scala/Predef$.MODULE$:Lscala/Predef$;
   3:  astore_1
   4:  getstatic  #33; //Field scala/Console$.MODULE$:Lscala/Console$;
   7:  ldc  #35; //String line 6
   9:  invokevirtual  #39; //Method scala/Console$.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
   12:  return
  LocalVariableTable:
   Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
   0      13      0    this       LTest;

  LineNumberTable:
   line 5: 0
   */
{noformat}

Without {{-optimize}}, closure creation and apply on line 6, as expected.

Here's a patch that fixes this. But I'm not familiar enough with the intent of the original code to be sure its a) appropriate and b) complete.

WIP SI-7518 Position retention for inlined code â€¦
The inliner was positioning all inlined instructions
at the method call (`targetPos). This makes debugging
of code compiled under `-optimize` difficult.

This commit retains the original position of the
inlined instruction if it is in the same source file
as the method call.

TODO: This still seems aribtrary. What was the intent
of using `targetPos`? Should we expand the above to
any source position? What about code inlined from class
files: should they be treated any differently?

James, assigning this to you for an opinion.
The new optimizer http://magarciaepfl.github.io/scala/  isn't prone to this bug. In the example, the closure body (which is invoked from the inlined higher-order method) contains the correct line number information:

{noformat}
  // access flags 0x1A
  private final static dlgt$27b8b21$1()V
   L0
    LINENUMBER 6 L0
    GETSTATIC scala/Predef$.MODULE$ : Lscala/Predef$;
    LDC "line 6"
    INVOKEVIRTUAL scala/Predef$.println (Ljava/lang/Object;)V
    RETURN
    MAXSTACK = 2
    MAXLOCALS = 0
{noformat}

A sidenote: Why aren't the instructions above also inlined alongside the instructions inlined for the higher-order method? Inlining a static method (e.g., the delegate above) is better done by the VM. Moreover, that's what the current optimizer does, with the consequence that:

{quote}
the current optimizer duplicates a closure body whenever that closure's apply() is invoked, the resulting code size taxes the JIT compiler. 
{quote}

With the new optimizer, the only way to avoid the code-duplication above is to write "optimizer-quirks-aware" code, as was done for {{immutable.Range}} in:
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/7abb0c911a7c3d60057fbcab6fc3687322a67082


@Miguel: Just to confirm: does the new backend take care *not* to attach line number information from other sourcefiles, if the inlined method and inline target are in different compilation units?
