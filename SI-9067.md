 it's a small detail yet might be useful. I find it annoying that a failed Enumeration#withName call tells me nothing about the argument supplied. What about a small change: 

```scala
   final def withName(s: String): Value = values.find(_.toString == s).getOrElse(
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(s"No value found for $s")
```

or to stay compatible

```scala
   final def withName(s: String): Value = values.find(_.toString == s).getOrElse(
      throw new NoSuchElementException(s"No value found for $s")
```

however I'm curious if anyone is seriously catching an NoSuchElementException :-)

I've posted this idea on the scala-internas as well:
