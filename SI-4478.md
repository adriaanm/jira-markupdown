=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.html

Look for example at "sortWith".


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Usage of internet slang should be replaced by a more formal wording.

=== What do you see instead? ===
{{That is, elements that are equal wrt lt appear in the same order in the sorted sequence as in the original.}}

I guess "wrt" means "with regard/respect to".

Maybe it would be better to replace these kinds of expressions by better wording. (I think grep'ping through the source might reveal a lot of these internet terms in other files, too.)

Additionally, the parens around "wrt lt" got eaten by ScalaDoc and the deprecated "sort" method has broken "=&gt;"s in the documentation.

Formatting problem is fixed. Isn't it?

However, there are many "wrt" in the source tree.

{noformat}
% git grep wrt | wc -l
      40
%
{noformat}


Looking better:

{noformat}
% git grep wrt | wc -l
30
{noformat}
