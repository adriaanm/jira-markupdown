According to the Scala coding standards, methods with side effects should have empty parenthesis. Hence, in `collection.mutable.PriorityQueue` the dequeuing method is `dequeue()`. However, the `dequeueAll` method has only a single argument list which carries the implicit `CanBuildFrom`. Thus you cannot call `pq.dequeueAll()`.

So if I'm not mistaken, the signature should be
```scala
def dequeueAll[A1 >: A, That]()(implicit bf: scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom[_, A1, That]): That 
```

?
