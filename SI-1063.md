Didn't get response from internal list, so here it is as a ticket:

```scala
trait A { def m: Any }
trait B { self: A => // or B with A, doesn't matter
  m // works
}

def f(b: B) { b.m } // m not found! 
```

I don't see a reason why this should not be allowed. Any instance of B with always be an instance of A.
