Probably this has not been caught before because it's not a very Scala-like way of doing things, but IMHO the following code should compile:
```scala
  var varNames = mutable.Set() : mutable.Set[String] // all variable names, for use in generating new names
  
  def freshName(old: String) : String = {
    val numStart = old.lastIndexWhere( c => (c>='0' && c <= '9') )
    val stem = old.slice( 0, numStart )
    var num = augmentString(old.slice( numStart, old.size )).toInt
    
    var newString = "" : String
    while(true) {
      num += 1
      newString = stem ++ num.toString
      if(!varNames.contains (newString))
        return newString
      assert (num < Int.MaxValue)
    }
  }
```
The error message I get is
```scala
   [scalac] /path/to/myfile.scala:18: error: type mismatch;
   [scalac]  found   : Unit
   [scalac]  required: String
   [scalac]     while(true) {
   [scalac]     ^
   [scalac] one error found
```
which makes no sense because while(true)... never emits a value. Similarly, I can append assert(false) to the function, but I get the same error (on the assertion, which also never returns a value).
Diggory Hardy: if you want "the right type" for `while (true)`, you should use such code instead of `while (true)`:
```scala
def whileTrue[T](p: => T): Nothing = {
  while(true) {p}
  sys.error("The impossible happened!") //Returns Nothing
}
def foo: String = whileTrue { return "" } //minimal use case, works
```

Sorry for the spam, but there was no other place to answer. To discuss further, please post a link to your question on scala-language (or on Stack Overflow).
