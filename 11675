Thanks A.P.Marki and sorry for the not-a-bug issue...

FYI I'm trying to add support for scripting in scala inside XWiki: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-132

The next problem I get now (in case you have an idea) is:

{noformat}
[init] error: error while loading Object, Missing dependency 'object scala in compiler mirror', required by /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_71.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/lang/Object.class)

Failed to initialize compiler: object scala in compiler mirror not found.
** Note that as of 2.8 scala does not assume use of the java classpath.
** For the old behavior pass -usejavacp to scala, or if using a Settings
** object programatically, settings.usejavacp.value = true.

Thanks again
