The API documentation seems quite unreliable (for example, according to http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.9.0.1/scala/Array.html [which contradicts http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.7.5/scala/Array.html ], I shouldn't be able to do Array(1, 2, 3).foreach(..)). 

Yes, that request is tickets SI-2077, SI-3531, SI-3813, and I'm sure there are even more exact duplicates.
