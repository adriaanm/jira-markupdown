While trying to find a minimal test case for #2216, I ran into this error after passing a null as an argument to an implicit parameter list.

It's not a blocking problem.

code and console output attached.
I meant to reference #2316, **not** #2216.
Here is a smaller example. The bug is not related to nulls nor implicits.
```scala
  trait Promise[A] extends (() => A)  
  
  object Promise {
    def promise[A]:Promise[A] = error("omitted")
  }
  
  trait Bind[Z[_]] {
    def bind[B]: Z[B]
  }
  
  object Bind {
     val PromiseBind = new Bind[Promise] {
       def bind[B] = error("omitted")
     }
   }
 
  object crash {
    def fmap[B]:Promise[B] = {
      var b = Bind.PromiseBind
      b.bind
    }
  }
```

Giving the type explicitly to PromiseBind or to bind solves the problem.
The failing normalize was testing an invariant about alias types being expanded by the time you get to erasure. The weird thing is, if you print the pt and pt.normalize for which (pt eq pt.normalize) does not hold, you get:

```scala
<root>SI-2#<empty>SI-4#BindSI-7363 and <root>SI-2#<empty>SI-4#BindSI-7363
```

There's definitely something that's going awry, though.. commenting out the assertion allows the compiler to get to a more serious one in genicode:

```scala
fatal: <refinement> has owner value PromiseBindSI-8942, but a class owner is required
```

I won't be able to fix this before I get back, so I'll assign back to you, Martin. Feel free to bounce it back by 13 april ;-)
Smaller test case that seems to indicate it's not directly caused by higher-kinded stuff, but rather by type inference for anonymous classes...

```scala
trait Bind {
  def bind[B]: B
}

object Test {
  val bind /*: Bind --> no crash*/ = new Bind {
    def bind[B]: Nothing /*: B --> no crash*/ = error("omitted")
  }

  bind.bind[Nothing]
}
```
I think the problem is in `adaptMember` in erasure:

```scala
        case Select(qual, name) if (name != nme.CONSTRUCTOR) =>
[...]
            } else if (!(qual1.isInstanceOf[Super] || (qual1.tpe.typeSymbol isSubClass tree.symbol.owner))) {
              assert(tree.symbol.owner != ArrayClass)
-              qual1 = cast(qual1, tree.symbol.owner.tpe)
+              qual1 = cast(qual1, tree.symbol.owner.tpe.normalize) // SI-2331
            }
-            treeCopy.Select(tree, qual1, name)
+           treeCopy.Select(tree, qual1, name) setSymbol NoSymbol // SI-2331: force re-typecheck as name may now refer to a different symbol
```
(In r22508) closes #2331: the pre-transform in Erasure did not correctly recurse in the case of a TypeApply.

It simply returned the function, which might very well have been, say, a Select node, which had to be erased in case the qualifier's type is a refinement.

(sorry about the whitespace changes)
