The meaning of the following comment in Plugins.scala is that `loadAllFrom` in Plugin.scala must ensure uniqueness.

The continuations plugin relies on this behavior, for instance.  Once instantiated, a plugin is free to muck with its global. (A Subcomponent has no lifecycle for init and destroy operations.)

If two continuations plugins are specified, the second, "stale" checker will not be "enabled." The enabled flag is propagated from the (proper) plugin to its subcomponents and to its checkers.

{code}
// Each plugin must only be instantiated once. A common pattern
// is to register annotation checkers during object construction, so
// creating multiple plugin instances will leave behind stale checkers.
{code}

Sample confusing output, which also occurs on 2.10 if $CJ is a nefarious file name like my-continuations.jar:

{code}
$ scalac -verbose -Ylog:all -P:continuations:enable -Xplugin:$CJ t1807.scala

That's one more error than if you don't specify -P::enabled at all, so go figure.

All is as it was before, and the timeline has been restored in which the duplication is silently glossed over.

It might be nice to issue a warning, in case someone is actually trying to monkey with the plugin in question.

The state of the class path is not specified, so it's not obvious whether it ought to prefer -Xpluginsdir or -Xplugin:myplugin.jar.  Presumably the answer is either pluginsdir because it's either earlier on the class path or actually on a parent class loader, or myplugin.jar because I specifically asked for it.
