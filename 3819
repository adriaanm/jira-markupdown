ok, so the "-neg" and "-run" files were there from old partest runs, i didn't realize that before. sorry.

the other problem remains: for instance i get
```scala
  neg\bug565.scala    [ FAILED ]
  neg\bug2144.scala   [   OK   ]
```

i get ".log" files for both, and comparing them to their ".check" the only difference is the filename in the error messages.
