You are being fooled by a (fixed since 2.9.0-1) bug in the repl.  If you compile and run this, they are in order.
```scala
object Test {
  val m = scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3, "four" -> 4, "five" -> 5)
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    m.keys foreach println
    m.keys drop 1 foreach println
  }
}
```
The repl has its own logic for printing traversables so Arrays don't get printed as mr. squiggly.
