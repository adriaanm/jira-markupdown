Forget that hunch.

This seems more promising: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/5070?expand=1

I think we can do better than:

{code}
    // more precise conceptually, but causes cyclic errors:    (paramss exists (_ contains sym))
    override def isImmediatelyDependent = (sym ne NoSymbol) && (sym.owner.isMethod && sym.isValueParameter)
{code}

.. from within implicit search, as we know the the current implicit method in question, and need only check that the type is not dependent on one of its parameters.
