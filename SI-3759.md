As discussed on this thread: http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/Infinite-recursion-appending-Iterators-td2324148.html#a2324148

The following code causes a stack overflow at Iterator.scala line 387:


```scala
var x = Iterator(4)
x = Iterator(5) ++ x
x.toList
//java.lang.StackOverflowError 
```





The reason is that the ++ method's parameter is by-name; x has been reassigned by the time it is evaluated.  While this is "correct" behaviour according to the semantics of by-name parameters and vars, I submit that this is an unreasonably surprising trap for such a simple use case.

Perhaps the parameter of Iterator.++ could become by-value?
Implementation note: other than one test which specifically looks for the argument to be by-name (bug3269.scala, #3269) nothing in trunk notices if the argument is not by name.  For binary compatibility reasons (sigh) a change which would have the same effect is removing the "lazy" from "lazy val it = that".
There are good reasons why the parameter is by name. And it would be a very subtle and very surprising change if we changed it now.
