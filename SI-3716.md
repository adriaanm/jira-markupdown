It looks like the introduction ## and the search/replace from hashCode accidentally caught the java source for msil.

src/msil/ch/epfl/lamp/compiler/msil/Type.java line 815 has `t.##` that should be reverted to `t.hashCode()`.
(In r22668) Reverted my brainless introduction of ## to a java file.
Closes SI-3716, no review.
