Consider the following examples:

```scala
scala> 1L.asInstanceOf[Int];
res8: Int = 1

scala> (1L : Any).asInstanceOf[Int];
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Long cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer
	at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(Unknown Source)
	at .<init>(<console>:5)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:3)
	at RequestResult$$.<clinit>(<console>)
	at RequestResult$$result(<console>)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
	at sun.reflect.Nati...
```

It seems that when you cast AnyVals of known types between eachother the compiler turns them into numeric conversions as with Java. However if you cast an Any to an AnyVal subtype it does not perform these conversions. This seems like very inconsistent behaviour to me (It's also counter to the specced behaviour).

There are two possible fixes here:

  * Remove the behaviour for performing numeric conversion on casts so that the first example would throw a ClassCastException.
  * Change the methods on BoxesRuntime such as unboxToInt so that they cast to Number instead of the appropriate numeric type. This way the same numeric conversions will be applied when you cast an arbitrary type to a value type.

I strongly prefer the former (in particular it's what the spec says should happen). I suspect the latter is the one that will annoy people the least. 
As a note aside (2.10.2 and 2.11.0-M7)
```scala
scala> 1L.isInstanceOf[Int]
res0: Boolean = false
```
As discussed in core meeting, will try to convert casts on boxed types to casts to `asInstanceOf\[Number\].longValue()` (as opposed to `asInstanceOf\[java.lang.Long\]`)
I tried and failed to get rid of conversion by casting years ago in #4437.
Thanks for the pointers, Paul. I don't see how this prevents us from fixing at least the casts on numbers which are non-null. But it is true that Scala's null semantics seem pretty much broken.
Being a young, naive and still motivated Scala hacker, I haven't lost hope we can fix that. I try to do some thinking and post in #4437. Any additional comments or pointers to use cases and thoughts are welcome.
Okay, thanks to retronym I can reconstruct, possibly with some mangling. Tobias's comment which I accidentally deleted:

Thanks for your feedback and taking the time.

`asInstanceOf` will always be able to cast an `Any` to a numeric type, but only to the "right" numeric type. Martin has asked me to "fix" this issue by allowing conversion also on boxed versions. You can find the fix in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3294

The problem is that it requires an additional `instanceof` check for every (!) unboxing operation since we also have to convert `java.lang.Character` which don't extend `java.lang.Number`.

Further, most of the concerns raised about disallowing casts for conversion were about breaking code. https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3295 (and comments) shows that we can properly deprecate such code and that it can easily be adapted (even the compiler just rewrites `asInstanceOf\[T\]` to `toT`).
Paul, I'm sorry if it wasn't clear from what I wrote that this issue has been re-discussed (that is including Martin). I thought mentioning that we discussed this in the core meeting was sufficient, as Martin usually attends.

More clearly: Martin was especially concerned with the fact that this makes boxing observable and thinks this (i.e. this ticket) needs to be fixed. He therefore proposed to lift the casts in unboxing from `asInstanceOf\[Int\]` to `asInstanceOf\[Number\]` (the OP's second proposed option) and see if something blows up.

[PR #3294](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3294) does this, nothing blows up, one additional `instanceof` is required. No feedback from Martin yet.
It's been so long since I've heard anyone mention the "core meeting" I thought the "as discussed in the core meeting" line was an unattributed quote from meeting minutes somewhere 2008-2010.
