In 2.9.0.1:

{code}
scala> List(1) ++ List('a')
res0: List[AnyVal] = List(1, a)
{code}

In 2.9.1RC1/2.10-trunk:

{code}
scala> List(1) ++ List('a')
res0: List[AnyVal{def getClass(): java.lang.Class[_ >: Int with Char <: AnyVal]}] = List(1, a)
{code}

I'm not sure if this is a bug or an enhancement.

Imho the type signature is exposing some implementation detail of getCLass for AnyVals (probably related to SI-864) and shouldn't appear anywhere.

I really don't want to explain that type signature to a beginner ...

The weird thing is that it disappears again if another List is concatenated:

{code}
scala> val list = List(1) ++ List('a') ++ List(1L)
list: List[AnyVal] = List(1, a, 1)
{code}

Considering that getClass is already special-cased for AnyVals, would it be possible to at least clean up the REPL output?


If a List with another AnyVal is concatenated, it disappears, but it remains for e.g.:

{code}
scala> List(1L) ++ List(1) ++ List(1L)
res4: List[AnyVal{def getClass(): java.lang.Class[_ >: Long with Int <: AnyVal]}] = List(1, 1, 1)
{code}

Personally, I find this a bit odd. If you then call getClass on it, you get:

{code}
scala> res4.getClass
res5: java.lang.Class[_ <: List[AnyVal{def getClass(): java.lang.Class[_ >: Long with Int <: AnyVal]}]] = class scala.collection.immutable.$colon$colon
{code}

Personally, I think this should just return Class[_ <: List[AnyVal]], but I see what the compiler is doing.
Simon, the stuff about Scaladoc is irrelevant to the meat of this ticket, so I removed it from the description. I'd suggest adding it as a comment on the pull request instead (with a reference to this ticket).

And with the Scaladoc stuff removed, having the ticket assigned to "Scaladoc Team" no longer makes sense, so I'm changing the status of the ticket to "Invalid", since Paul said "The inferred type is correct."

The inferred type may be "correct" in some sense, but it certainly doesn't *seem* like the best type to be inferred here. Is this really how it must be? If it stays this way I think this is going to get noticed pretty frequently — especially by beginners.

I'll take it up on the mailing list.

The issue isn't particular to getClass. The change that was made to getClass merely exposes something about the least-upper-bound algorithm that hasn't changed in many years. 2.9, 2.8, and 2.7 all show:

{noformat}
scala> abstract class A { def f: Class[_] }
defined class A

scala> class A1 extends A { override def f = classOf[Int] }
defined class A1

scala> class A2 extends A { override def f = classOf[Char] }
defined class A2

scala> List(new A1) ++ List(new A2)
res2: List[A{def f: java.lang.Class[_ >: Int with Char <: AnyVal]}] = List(A1@52ac5024, A2@2ec195e3)
{noformat}

There has been worse stuff than this for a long time and we've survived this long.

Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).

scala> List(1L: java.lang.Long) ++ List(1: java.lang.Integer)
res0: List[java.lang.Number with java.lang.Comparable[_ >: java.lang.Long with java.lang.Integer <: java.lang.Number with java.lang.Comparable[_ >: java.lang.Long with java.lang.Integer <: java.lang.Number with java.lang.Comparable[_ >: java.lang.Long with java.lang.Integer <: java.lang.Number]]]] = List(1, 1)

Martin writes: "Since refinements are legal Scala types they may appear as lubs. That fact is used in a lot of Scala code. One way out of this particular pickle would be to teach the typechecker that the glb of Char and Int is Nothing, and likewise for the other value types. I think that would fix the problem." from https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-language/mThYtcdajfc/9b3wJa2VOwAJ

So, reopening the ticket but reclassifying it as an enhancement. Martin's suggestion wouldn't help the java.lang.Long/Integer case Paul noticed, but oh well.



(extempore in [r26001|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26001]) Sin some more.

"Fiddle with lubs and glbs by never considering getClass as a member in
a refinement generated from them. In a sense we have justification for
this by saying we already treated getClass in an ad-hoc way, so we might
as well go all the way." -- m. odersky

Closes SI-4846.
