according to documentation https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tags+and+Annotations @author tag should work everywhere, but it does not seems to work. 

Lets take a look on package object. Example:

/**
  Command line getopt parser.
  @author Radim Kolar
  @version 1.0
  @since today
*/
package object getopt {
}

renders as:

 getopt

Command line getopt parser.

Version

    1.0
