It's kind of criminal that there's no built-in way to break a linear sequence into (x.init, x.last) without traversing the list twice.  Once is bad enough.

There's an easy win/win here.  Make splitAt allow negative indices which work from the back of the sequence.  Then:

List(1,2,3,4,5).splitAt(-1) == (List(1, 2, 3, 4), List(5))
I think anybody trying to do splitAt on a linear sequence does not deserve better than we do now. Seriously, the proposed change has lost of disadvantages for consistency and error detection. The gain is not worth it, IMO.
