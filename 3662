(In r21221) Added support for Int and multi-string compiler switches (elideLevel, Yrecursion, plugin, disable, require, pluginOptions); some cleanup of compiler settings dialog (still pretty gross unfortunately); added support for continuations plugins (set 'P' setting to "continuations:enable"). Fixes SI-3184.
