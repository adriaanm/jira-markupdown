(extempore in [r25392|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25392]) Changed forwarders not to generate final methods, which otherwise would
induce VerifyErrors anytime the companion class was subclassed and had a
method with the same signature.  Closes SI-4827, no review.
