Not exactly a showstopper, but in 2.6.0-RC2, if you evaluate:
```scala
def fl1[A](l: List[List[A]])= l match {
  case List() => List[A]();
  case x :: xs => x ::: fl1(xs);
}
```

you get:
```scala
<console>:7: error: illegal cyclic reference involving method fl1
  case x :: xs => x ::: fl1(xs);
                    ^
```

Which wasn't very illuminating.  I would have expected something like:
```scala
<console>:7: error: recursive method fl1 needs result type
  case x :: xs => x ::: fl1(xs);
```
which is what you get if you remove the type-parameterization
