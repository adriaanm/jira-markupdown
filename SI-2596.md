`Console.out.println("Les Mis�rables")` prints Les Mis?rables on my mac.

```scala
val out = new java.io.PrintStream(System.out, true, "UTF-8")
out.println("Les Mis�rables") 
```

does the right thing. See also: #2565

Output printed by the interpreter suffers from the same issue. Should we change Console.out to wrap System.out in something that handles utf-8 properly as shown above?
If you google scala-internals encodings you will see some long emails from me trying to improve this situation, with special emphasis on UTF-8 on the mac.  Most people were in favor of standardizing the default encoding, but martin and miles opposed.  I keep this alias around in the meantime:
```scala
alias utf8scala='JAVA_OPTS="-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" scala'
```
