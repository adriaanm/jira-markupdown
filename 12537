`TRANS_FLAG` does not (and should not) correspond to `JAVA_ACC_TRANSIENT`: it is a special flag that can be used within a phase to pass information from one traversal to another. By convention, it should always be reset at the end of the phase.

In fact, there is no Scala flag that corresponds to `JAVA_ACC_TRANSIENT`. The same is also true for `JAVA_ACC_VOLATILE`, `JAVA_ACC_NATIVE`, probably others. The actual Scala equivalent for these is an annotation, so I think the classfile parser should add the corresponding annotation to the symbol. I don't think there's an existing example where this is being done.
