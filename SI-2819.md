I suggest the following addition to Predef:

{code}
type =>?[A, B] = PartialFunction[A, B]
{code}

Partial functions could thus be declared like:

{code}
val f: Int =>? Int = { case i: Int => i * 2 }
{code}

I think that this elegantly captures the nature of a partial function in contrast to a regular function that uses the => operator.

Are you suggesting that =>? have meaning to the compiler and not be a simple type alias?

I'd love it if Scala's support for partial functions paralleled that of ordinary functions.  In other words it would be great to be able to write:

{code}
val f: (Int, Int) =>? String) = { case 0, 0 => "Two zeros"; case i, j => "Non-zeros: " + i + ", " + j }
{code}

and have f be of type PartialFunction2[Int, Int, String] (which extends Function2[Int, Int, String]).

There are probably reasons why it doesn't work this way now.
I really like the syntax, but do not want to have more than one partial function. Let's keep it as an alias as original proposed. 

Regarding arity: The right way to go about this is to make all functions unary. So
(int, int) => int should be interpreted as a function from 2-tuples to ints. We have to do some transformations to make this efficient, but that's the plan. If we succeed with this, =>& would be treated no differently than =>.
