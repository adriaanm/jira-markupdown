Compiling (or interpreting with {{scala -target:jvm-1.4}}) the following class

{code}
import java.io.File
class LogFile(parent: File, name: String) extends File(parent, name) {
  var toDelete = false
}
{code}

gives

{code}
LogFile.scala:2: error: class LogFile needs to be abstract, since method compareTo in trait Comparable of type (scala.this.Any)scala.this.Int is not defined
{code}

(The class is in fact {{scala.tools.partest.nest.LogFile}}, defined in Worker.scala, and prevents the 1.4-build from working).
