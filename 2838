This is because zip(ped) uses `<:<` instead of `<%<`, so I assume I can go ahead and implement the TODO in there?

BTW,  I guess I shouldn't be editing TupleN.scala, but updating genprod instead...
```scala
// TODO: probably loosen zip and zipped from <:< to <%<

  def zip[Repr1, El1, El2, To](implicit w1:   T1 <:< TraversableLike[El1, Repr1], 
                                        w2:   T2 <:< Iterable[El2], 
....
```
