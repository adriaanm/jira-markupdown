If I create LL/LLL/etc specializations, the compiler crashes during mixin finding duplicate members.  I don't think it makes any sense to create L specializations but not LL, LLL, etc. so the upshot is that your test case still behaves the same even though this is fixed.  Mine on the other hand prints
{noformat}
C0$mcIII$sp
C0$mcIIL$sp
C0$mcILI$sp
C0$mcILL$sp
C0$mcLII$sp
C0$mcLIL$sp
C0$mcLLI$sp
C0
{noformat}
If there is sufficient motivation we can look into whether it makes sense to generate those all-AnyRef specializations, but I have no more time for this right now.
