Could someone please make a cheatsheet much like the following; http://docs.codehaus.org/download/attachments/2715/groovy-reference-card.pdf.  It really helps when learning a language.

groovy source; http://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/trunk/groovy/groovy-core/src/latex/.  I've attached a .zip containing everything in the dir.  s=source and c=cheatsheet.

That would do for now, if you need more just ask.
As with #1013, not appropriate for trac.
