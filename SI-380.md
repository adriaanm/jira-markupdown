In eclipse 3.3.1.1 with the latest plugin (installed via update site); do the following to reproduce:

- Create a scala class e.g. **Foo.scala**

- Right click on the new artifacts, choose refactor>rename and call it **Fool**

You will notice that the filesystem now contains Fool.java but internally the source still has class Foo.
If the intended behavior is to rename the *file*, then this is not a bug.  If the intended behavior is to rename uses of the _class', then this is a bug.  However, even if the latter is the correct interpretation it sounds like Eclipse is providing the wrong user interface, because it does not sound like there is a way to rename a class `Foo` that appears in a file `Bar`. 
I can only make sense of this as a request for a rename refactoring. It's planned, but as Sean implies it'll be a big job.
