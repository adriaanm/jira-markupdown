= problem =

The documentation generated by scaladoc includes several JavaScript libraries but their license files are not included there.
I think that by using/distributing/copying the documentation generated by scaladoc one is also effectively using/distributing/copying the included JavaScript software and therefore the appropriate license information related to that software should be included in the generated documentation.

= analysis =

=== 1. The problem is related to the following files: ===

 * src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/jquery.js
 * src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/jquery-ui.js 
 * src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/jquery.layout.js 
 * src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/tools.tooltip.js 

=== 2. The license files for 2 out of 4 of those files are present in docs/licenses: ===

 * jquery.js: docs/licenses/mit_jquery.txt , docs/licenses/mit_sizzle.txt 
 * tools.tooltip.js: docs/licenses/mit_tools.tooltip.txt 

All of them include the following statement:
 
"The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in 
all copies or substantial portions of the Software. "

By inspecting the JavaScript files one can see that the "copyright notices" are included but the "permission notice" is not.

=== 3. The license files for the other 2 files are not even present in docs/licenses ===

The license information for the following files is not present in docs/licenses:

 * src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/jquery-ui.js 
 * src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/jquery.layout.js 

= enhancement recommendation =

I have the following suggestions (however please note that I am not a lawyer).

== suggestion 1 ==

=== Option 1 ===

The above JavaScript files could be modified to include the appropriate missing information directly in those files.

=== Option 2 ===

Alternatively (or in addition to the option 1), the appropriate license/copyright files could be included in the directory src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/resource/lib/ and in consequence added to the scala-compiler.jar and the scaladoc tool could copy those files together with other files from that directory to the lib directory of the generated documentation.

== suggestion 2 ==

The missing license files should be added to docs/licenses. It is strange that the license files for 2 out of 4 JavaScript libraries are present there and that the license files for the other 2 are not present.

Or, if the option 1 above is implemented, then maybe the license files related to those JavaScript files could be removed from docs/licenses. Maybe a simple information could just be added somewhere indicating that those JavaScript files are included with the scala distribution and that the copyright/license info has been added to those files direclty?
