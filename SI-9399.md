Using a similar type hierarchy to #9398, the following code produces a spurious exhaustiveness warning.


```scala
  sealed abstract class TA
  sealed abstract class TB extends TA
  case object A extends TA
  case object B extends TB

  sealed trait C
  case class CTA(id: Int, da: TA) extends C
  case class CTB(id: Int, da: TB) extends C

  val test: C => Unit = {
    case CTA(_, A) =>
    case CTA(_, B) =>
    case CTB(_, B) =>
  }
```
produces
```
match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: CTB(_, _)
    val test: C => Unit = {
```
Interestingly, it goes away if you change the order of cases. This produces no warning:
```scala
  val test: C => Unit = {
    case CTB(_, B) =>
    case CTA(_, B) =>
    case CTA(_, A) =>
  }
```
My prototype fix for #9630 (linked from that ticket) also fixes this one. I'll update this ticket when we get that polished and merged.

A workaround is to avoid using the same name for the case class fields in sibling case classes.

```scala
sealed trait C
case class CTA(id: Int, da: TA) extends C
case class CTB(id1: Int, da1: TB) extends C
```
