(extempore in [r25979|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25979]) Fix for regression in overriding with defaults.

I should know better than to behave as if usable inferences can
be drawn from a comment like "SYNTHETIC because of DEVIRTUALIZE".
Maybe it was even true when it was written, but no more.
Closes scala/bug#5178, no review.
