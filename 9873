I'm guessing that the mirror symbol is actually supposed to be a distinct symbol.
```scala
/** Find a 'mirror' of symbol `sym` in unit `unit`. Pre: `unit is loaded. */
  private def findMirrorSymbol(sym: Symbol, unit: RichCompilationUnit): Symbol = {
```

The problem is that it ends up in the decls of its owner's (TypeTags) info.
