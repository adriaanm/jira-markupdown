I have the Java-class-without-a-constructor error on a public Java class that has a public constructor. I moved from the latest production (non 2.8) plugin to the nightly plugin based on ticket 1840. But that didn't help.

This code in object RPTestScala

    package com.foo.bar.rpbeantest
    import _root_.com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager;
    ....
    val manager = new RPManager()

Has this errror on the final line

    com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager does not have a constructor

but other classes are constructible

    val request = new RPRequest()

--------

Disassembly of the Java jar shows:

$$ javap -classpath ~/Desktop/rpbean/lib/rpbean.jar com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager | grep RPMan
Compiled from "RPManager.java"
public class com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager extends java.lang.Object implements java.io.Serializable{
    static java.lang.Class class$$com$$epiphany$$rpbean$$RPManager;
    public com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager();

So on the command line the problem is there is a class required by RPManager that is not present. And that is throwing things off. Somehow the Eclipse plugin is hiding the root cause (the missing dependency) and because that causes the class I'm trying to use to have trouble loading, I get a cryptic error that says it has no constructor. We need the real error to be surfaced in the errors somehow. The missing constructor error is a red herring.

$$ scalac -classpath ~/Desktop/rpbean/lib/rpbean.jar -sourcepath src src/com/foo/bar/rpbeantest/RPTestScala.scala 
error: error while loading RPManager, class file '/Users/splee/Desktop/rpbean/lib/rpbean.jar(com/epiphany/rpbean/RPManager.class)' is broken
(class com.epiphany.shr.util.logging.ILoggerCategory not found.)
src/com/apple/store/rpbeantest/RPTestScala.scala:44: error: com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager does not have a constructor
    val manager = new RPManager()
                  ^
two errors found

Sort of.

On the command line (I'm back on 2.7.5 in both Eclipse and command line) I see two errors:

  * The root cause: missing dependency causing the class not to load
  * Because the class did not load, the red-herring error about no constructor

But in Eclipse I only see the second error message.

In my opinion the bug is around the behavior when the class I'm trying to use fails to load. If that is a recoverable error where we will still be able to get the methods and types and stuff out of the class file, then great things should continue, but maybe with a warning. But as is shown here, it is *not* a recoverable error, and the attempt to recover is causing us to run into the second message, which makes no sense at all, especially if (as is the case in the Eclipse plugin) it is the only error message you see.

So the behavior is different between command line and Eclipse. Eclipse is showing a subset of the errors. That is making it hard for the user to see what to do to resolve the problem. It ends up looking like a deep bug in the compiler when its really a combination of a bug / iffy feature (attempting to recover from failed class load but failing to do anything useful) in the complier AND a bug / iffy feature (only displaying a subset of the error messages so you don't always get the same info you'd get from the command-line compiler) in the Eclipse plugin.

Does that help?
So the Eclipse-related bug is that under some circumstances errors can be masked by other errors?
