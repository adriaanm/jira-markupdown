Jason suggest this might be a related issue/fix scala/bug#6976 https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1910. On the surface I don't think it is. With this issue we've got a problem with some names that start different (making lookup fail) and then at a later phase become the same. 6976 is our old friend lazy initialization.
