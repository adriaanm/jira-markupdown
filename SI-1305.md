I was wondering if there is a reason why the following is not allowed:

```scala
   implicit def foo(value : Int) = println(value)

   for (implicit elem : Array(1,2,3)) foo
```

of course the 'implicit' is even more to write than the '(elem)' at the end if 'foo' is only called once inside the loop. On the other hand the same is true with the keyword in front of a method parameter, which works well.
I scratched my head at this a bit, but ijuma on IRC helped me understand what gestalt probably meant.
I think he means more like this:
```scala
def foo(implicit value: Int) = println(value)

for (implicit elem <- Array(1,2,3)) foo
```

It would require, I suppose, changing the for-comprehension expansion from

```scala
for (p <- e) e'
```
becoming
```scala
e.foreach { case p => e' }
```

to something like
```scala
e.foreach { dummy => [implicit] val p = dummy ; e' }
```
