If I understand correctly, there is a clash between the named parameter {{payer}} and the local {{payer}} value.

But the scope of the named parameter should be limited to the method call, shouldn't it?

{code}
val p = Payment(payer = Some("payer"))
{code}
and 
{code}
val p = Payment(Some("payer"))
{code}
should be the equivalent, given that Payment only have one parameter.

And the last one compiles just fine.
