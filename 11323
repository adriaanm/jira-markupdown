If I understand correctly, there is a clash between the named parameter `payer` and the local `payer` value.

But the scope of the named parameter should be limited to the method call, shouldn't it?
```scala
val p = Payment(payer = Some("payer"))
```
and 
```scala
val p = Payment(Some("payer"))
```
should be the equivalent, given that Payment only have one parameter.

And the last one compiles just fine.
