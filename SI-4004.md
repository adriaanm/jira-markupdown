Having definition.
```scala
 class X { def y = 1; def z = 2 }
```

and using it like:
```scala
  new X { y;z }
```

we're having anonymous class generated. But usually this type of code is just used to avoid boilerplate like:
```scala
 val x = new X
 x.y
 x.z
 x....
```

Compiler should avoid generating anonymous classes in such cases, performing "rewriting" code in boilerplate style if it can.
