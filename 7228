I've especially found this to be bothersome when building DSLs which pass in objects, such as:

{code}
    object FROM
    
    object SELECT {
      def *(f: FROM.type) = ???
    }
{code}

One could try and use the function value, but this will not work if we need polymorphism...
{code}
      val * = (_: FROM.type) => ???
      val * = (_: TO.type) => ??? // clash
{code}
