If I annotate a class in scala, using a annotation defined in java with RetentionPolicy.CLASS, the annotation is retained at runtime.

Here's a typical example using Peter Kriens' annotations for OSGi:
{code}
@aQute.bnd.annotation.component.Component class MyComp
{code}

If I launch the REPL with my class in the classpath, but without the definition of the annotation, and I simply try to instantiate the class, I get the following error:
{code}
scala> val c = new MyComp
error: error while loading MyComp, Missing dependency 'class aQute.bnd.annotation.component.Component', required by ./MyComp.class
<console>:5: error: MyComp does not have a constructor
       val c = new MyComp
{code}

And if I use Peter Kriens' class dump utility, it shows the following information:
{code}
2: attribute                   RuntimeVisibleAnnotations(#16)
2: Number of annotations       2
2: type                        LaQute/bnd/annotation/component/Component;(#12)2: num_element_value_pairs     0
2: type                        Lscala/reflect/ScalaSignature;(#13)2: num_element_value_pairs     1
{code}

This is very problematic in an OSGi environment where the package should not even need to be imported. 
This is related to (and could probably be the cause of) SI-5420.
Funny coincidence ... I just fixed this and SI-5420 5 minutes ago. Is it ok if I create a PR on Thursday?
Just tried to update this patch to finally get rid of this ticket: https://github.com/soc/scala/tree/SI-4788-new ... apart from the known issue of scalac thinking that classOf doesn't exist in Predef, the test suite now fails with over 400 failures + nondeterminism:

{code}
test/partest --failed
{code}

{code}
Selected 402 tests drawn from previously failed tests

# starting 60 tests in pos
ok  1 - pos/NoCyclicReference.scala

!!  8 - pos/inline-access-levels                  [compilation failed]
...
{code}

Many of the failures are related to annotated elements just "disappearing":

{code}
@foo val bar = 1
//Somewhere else:
println(bar)
// scalac: Hey dude, bar doesn't exist, amiright?!
{code}

But not all of the failures use annotations.

I'm running out of ideas how a fix to make scalac determine correctly whether a Java annotation should be visible at runtime can wreak such a havoc all over the place.

I'd be happy about any help in this regard.
The fix in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4026 only works under separate compilation, because annotations are skipped by the Java parser. We have an open issue for this: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8928, so this one can be closed.

{code}
@Retention(value=SOURCE) // not parsed by the Java parser
@interface SAnnotation {}
{code}

Tests updated accordingly in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5606.
