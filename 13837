When running partest on Windows, some stack-intensive tests will fail on jdk 1.5; however, if the same tests are run via "ant test", all is well. This is likely to be a partest/scalacfork issue, related to the stack overflows detected by Stephane after David MacIver's r16335.

Steps to reproduce: on Windows, jdk 1.5:
{code}
svn co http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/svn-repos/scala/scala/branches/2.7.2 scala272svn
cd scala272svn
ant
test\partest test\files\shootout\ackermann.scala
{code}
