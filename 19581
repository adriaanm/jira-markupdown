Scaladoc uses @usecase annotations to output simplified entries for methods with scary signatures. See scala/bug#5054

For symbols with @usecase annotations, the anchor link generated in the HTML output contains the text of the usecase signature, not the full signature.

This makes life difficult for external tools (IDEs) that want to generate links to specific Scala members. In the general case it is sufficient to use Symbol#signatureString to compute the anchor.  However, for symbols with @usecases, one has to parse and understand the doc comments in order to form a working url, which is a pain.

Can we please emit a redundant anchor link for usecase entries, with the full signature? This would be backward compatible with all existing urls.
