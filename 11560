If you supply explicit types for the implicits:
{noformat}
[error] /home/apm/tmp/thanassis/src/main/scala/alldone.scala:108: forward reference extends over definition of value bigDecimalCellSetter
[error]       def setCell(cell: Cell, data: math.BigDecimal) {cell.setCellValue(data) }
[error]                                                       ^
[error] one error found
{noformat}
I guess it's using RichCell.

Both answers on SO resulted in finding crashers. Is that a record?

This issue also showed cyclic ref resulting in bad tree to backend:

Overloading is required here for the crash. Test:
