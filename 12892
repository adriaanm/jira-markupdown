Predef.format("Hi there: {0}\n", "peter") prints "Hi there: Array(peter)" instead of "Hi there: peter"

The _* is missing from the repeated args: it needs to change from
{code}
  def format(text: String, xs: Any*) = Console.format(text, xs)
{code}
to
{code}
  def format(text: String, xs: Any*) = Console.format(text, xs: _*)
{code}
