Hi,

having access to the erased types is great - only that the Manifest isn't Serializable is a problem:

{code}
private final scala.reflect.Manifest de.footprint.wicket.model.ElementModel.mf [class=
scala.reflect.Manifest$$$$anon$$2] <----- field that is not serializable
{code}

Could you take care of this one?

Thanks!
