It appears that Scala treats synchronized as a method off of java.lang.Object,
although no such method exists on the Java object.

If you define a no argument method yourself in a class, then you hide the built
in synchronized method.

scalac should require an override modifier on the synchronized method then.
Closing this ticket.  The behavior of the compiler is correct.  See
