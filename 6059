These methods exist on java.math.BigDecimal. The Scala wrapper has many fewer methods — likely for no real reason except that whoever wrote the wrapper, years ago, had better things to do.

Going through and adding this and other missing methods to the wrapper — with tests, of course — would make a great community/Scalathon contribution, I think.
