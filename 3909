OK, I see.. I'm not sure what to do.

Using default arguments in patterns is currently not supported, the fact that it's not disallowed for this extractor is rather a missed case, maybe we should disallow it for now.

There's a whole space to explore on the interaction of named/default arguments and pattern matching. If we start doing this, we will end up with this kind of blocks during pattern matching (and btw, blocks don't need to have symbols).
