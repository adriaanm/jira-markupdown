Okay, that's cool and all, but do you have any good reason why _ should not be kind-polymorphic? Isn't it blazingly obvious what _ means in a '* -> * expected' context? There's always going to be a manual translation available, and obviously you can't refer to things without names, so it's not like soundness is going to come into play. (Not that I think soundness is on anyone's mind.)
