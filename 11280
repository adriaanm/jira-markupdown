Nice, that method is very wrong indeed:

{code}
public int apply$mcII$sp(int);
    descriptor: (I)I
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC
    Code:
      stack=3, locals=2, args_size=2
         0: aload_0       
         1: ldc           #25                 // String two
         3: iload_1       
         4: invokespecial #31                 // Method ClassOne.m:(Ljava/lang/String;I)I
         7: ireturn       
      LocalVariableTable:
        Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
            0       8     0  this   LClassTwo$$anonfun$1;
            0       8     1   x$1   I
{code}
{{this}} obviously isn't a {{ClassOne}} in that anonymous function. It should use the outer reference to the {{ClassTwo}} instance. And the outer ref is used when calling {{super.m}} or just {{m}}, but not {{super\[ClassOne\].m}}...
