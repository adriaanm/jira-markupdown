As part of the resolution to SI-3791, `Double.MinLong` (and similar) were deprecated.

I just noticed that similar definitions exist on `BigInt` and `BigDecimal`, and in fact refer to the now-deprecated methods. I suggest a similar deprecation and introduction of new methods for consistency.

Assigning to Lukas, who worked on the previous ticket.
