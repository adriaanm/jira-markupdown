Jason proposed we would look into special casing TypeRefs that have small arity (probably 0, 1 and 2) in order to reduce memory consumption coming from references to `::` objects.
It's a bit off topic, but what's the reason that "redundant outer pointers" aren't removed by, say, the optimizer? Does "separate compilation" stand in the way?

At least for "late closure classes", the new optimizer does a thorough job of squashing unneeded outer pointers,

I thought that Constructors would detect (most) cases of redundant outer pointers, isn't that enough?

That's a good question. I'm not really sure what is triggering the creation and retention of that outer pointer.

e.g. what is different about Types/TypeRef to this example?

```scala
scala> trait T { val t = "t"; class C { def tt = t }; object O { def foo = new C {} } }
defined trait T

scala> new T{}.O.foo.getClass.getDeclaredFields
res2: Array[java.lang.reflect.Field] = Array()
```

Needs some investigation.
I've added a recent optimization of Paul's to the branch.

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/79b18ccf9

That takes TypeRefs from 54 bytes to 40 bytes, by moving usually-null fields to global maps. Back-of-the-envelope-wise, it should save about 2-3% of our retained memory.
