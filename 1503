(In r20017) The installer finally works as expected on x64 systems
with 64bit VMs. Also, updated installer compiler
to version 4.3.2; added x64 support for shortcut
creation; fixed long-standing error in installation
files that was preventing registry entries from
ever being removed upon uninstallation; added
more informative messages during installation;
restored 1.5 as the minimal JVM version number
required for installation.

This revision closes scala/bug#1634.
