Arguably we need to get rid of flags in Modifiers (similarly to what've been done for Symbols). 

However, it'd also be great to support the following use case:

```scala
def buildParams(methodType: Type) =
  paramss(methodType) map { params =>
    params map { p =>
      ValDef(
        Modifiers(p.flags),
        newTermName(p.name.toString),
        paramType(p.typeSignature),
        EmptyTree)
    }
  }
```

Rather controversial requirements, but this only makes it more interesting.
