Note: Given an `tree @ DefDef(..., vparamss, ...)`, you cannot generally assume that the symbols
{code}
vparamss map (_.map(_.symbol))
{code}
and
{code}
tree.tpe.paramss
{code}
are the same or have the same names. The same is true for type parameters, there it's actually implemented more systematically (using the infamous "skolems").
