How can we produce error messages that are more descriptive than, say, `no implicit value of type BuilderFactory[Int, RichString, RichString] found`?

Maybe we can annotate `BuilderFactory` to indicate that it represents a type function (from type parameters Elem and From to To) that is defined by the implicit values that populate the corresponding type `BuilderFactory[Elem, From, To]`. 

This way, the error message could be: `RichString (type param To in BuilderFactory) is not a valid container for elements of type Int (type param Elem in BuilderFactory) that were derived from RichString (type param From in BuilderFactory.`
fixed in r22804
  
example:

{code}
    @implicitNotFound(msg="Custom error message that may refer to type parameters ${T} and ${U}")
    trait Constraint[T, U]
{code}

whenever an implicit argument of type `Constraint[A, B]` cannot be found, the custom error message will be used, where the type arguments are interpolated in the obvious way
    
note: if the msg in the annotation references non-existing type params, a warning is emitted

This looks great.  I'm happy to see ways to improve implicit-related error messages.  What do you think about something similar at the definition site of a method with implicit parameters.  Something like:
{code}
@implicitNotFound(msg="Custom msg referencing ${y} ...")
def x(implicit y: Z) ...
{code}
Yes, `flatten` is along the lines of what I was thinking of. I don't understand your argument, though.  The implicit is a function `T => Traversable[S]` and a typical error looks like:
{code}
scala> Traversable(1,2).flatten    
<console>:6: error: could not find implicit value for parameter asTraversable: (Int) => Traversable[B]
       Traversable(1,2).flatten
                        ^
{code}

It seems to me that your suggested error message
{code}
Cannot flatten a traversable of Int: the elements must be traversable.
{code}

would be a worthwhile improvement for newer users.  You don't have to understand implicits to understand your mistake.
yes, but that could also be achieved by using `<%<` instead of `=>` for the implicit arg of `flatten` and annotating `<%<` so that you get a message more suitable to the type mismatch that it implies

that is, once I fix SI-3346 or SI-3340, or both -- whatever was blocking that (don't remember off the top of my head)
By the way, Daniel Sobral pointed out on Twitter that ${From} is not used in the annotation message:

{code}
@implicitNotFound(msg = "Cannot construct a collection of type ${To} with elements of type ${Elem} based on a collection of type ${To}.")
{code}

Maybe the second ${To} was meant to be ${From}?
