I'm having some trouble with the fsc ant task. Building the attached project with {{ant compile.fsc}} produces the following output:
{code}
Buildfile: build.xml
     [echo] scala home is at /home/rompf/scala/build/pack/

compile.fsc:
      [fsc] Compiling 1 source file to /home/rompf/unpack/bugreports/ant/classes
      [fsc] [Server arguments: -d /home/rompf/unpack/bugreports
/ant/classes -classpath /home/rompf/scala/build/pack/lib/scala-
compiler.jar:/home/rompf/scala/build/pack/lib/scala-library.jar

      [fsc] [Port number: -1]
      [fsc] Could not connect to compilation daemon.

{code}
whereas running {{ant compile.scalac}} works fine.

Running {{fsc -verbose}} from the shell also works and produces the following output
{code}
[Server arguments: -d /home/rompf/unpack/bugreports/ant/. -verbose]
[VM arguments: ]
[Temp directory: /home/rompf/scala/build/pack/var/scala-devel]
[Port number: 44162]
[Connected to compilation daemon at port 44162]
...
{code}

A reason for the observed behavior might be that {{scala.tools.nsc.Properties.scalaHome}} is defined as {{System.getProperty("scala.home")}}, which might, I would suspect, not be available to the ant task. The command-line fsc tool wrapper sets this property explicitly using {{-D...}} when starting the VM.

An easy fix would be to pass {{scala.home}} directly to the ant task as a seperate property.
I cannot reproduce the problem, on my machine it says:
{code}
      [fsc] [VM arguments: ]
      [fsc] [Temp directory: /Users/cunei/tmp]
      [fsc] [Executed command: scala scala.tools.nsc.CompileServer]
      [fsc] [Port number: 53411]
      [fsc] [Connected to compilation daemon at port 53411]
      [fsc] [Starting new compile server instance]
{code}
It is not unlikely that this got solved as a side effect of other fixes. Can you please verify if you still see this problem?
