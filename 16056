```scala
object Main {
  new qwe.C1(): String
}

package qwe {
  class C1
}

package object qwe {
  implicit def c1ToString(ref: C1): String = ""
}
```

=== Additional information ===

A straw poll reveals that Scala programmers far and wide have come to rely on the implicit scope including the package objects of the containing packages of the parts of the type.

Assuming this is intentional, or at least serendipitous, it ought to be enshrined in the spec.
