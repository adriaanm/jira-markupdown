The Scala specification says:

�6.12.4 (simplified)
``l += r`` can be re-interpreted as ``l = l + r`` only when both
 1. ``l``does not define ``+=``directly of through an implicit conversion 
 2. ``l`` is a variable of a type containing ``+``.

�4.2 (simplified)
An implementation of a class containing variable declarations may define these variables using variable definitions, or it may define setter and getter functions directly.

The specification is not completely clear, but can be read to say that both setter and getter must be defined in the same class, not inherited, to be equivalent to a variable and to allow using ``+=``. As such, the behaviour you report follows the specification.

Clearly, this could be improved, but it requires a change of specification. I'll reassign the issue to the Scala community to be reconsidered when we have more time, or by an external contributor.
