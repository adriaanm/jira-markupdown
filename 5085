As Paul says, ticket scala/bug#2749 has more information about this issue. In short, inner classes defined inside an object are generated as part of the companion class, so that Java programs can access them with the usual syntax (`B.Inner` instead of `B$$.Inner`). We really need a Scala specific reflection library, which works on the correct types. Until then, I really don't know what we can do.
