I enter following command line on Windows.
{code}
fsc -encoding UTF-8 -P:continuations:enable -classpath build/classes;lib/dep.jar -sourcepath src -d build/classes src/Main.scala
del lib\dep.jar
{code}

And I got:
{code}
另一个程序正在使用此文件，进程无法访问。
{code}

The error message means "The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process".

I think fsc should detect JAR files's changes automatically, instead of locking them and preventing them from being changed.
