The jarfile scala-compiler.jar of version 2.10.2 contains a file 
META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory which content is
scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain$Factory

When using some JRE-233 applications (such as jython, jruby or others) alongside with scala, I get the annoying error message:
ScriptEngineManager providers.next(): javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory: Provider scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain$Factory not found
That's perfectly justified since that class is only part of 2.11 milestones, not of the 2.10 serie. 

It seems to me that the something is rotten in the jar construction infrastructure, resulting in the javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory file being shared between 2.10 and 2.11 branches.

It would be very cool if the next 2.10 release may not have this file, please.

Thanks for your work, Mt.

PS: sorry for the clearly overstated priority, but the webapp don't seem to want me to lower this.
+1 review of scripting.

+1 giant collage. Or a Philip Glass opera of which "Blocker Blocker" is merely one act.

I take exception to "the worst piece of software ever known", as I believe I worked on that, on a previous gig.

I just realized that the emails that say "Bug Bug", mean the first "Bug" is the bug icon.

+1 for the name "Martin Quinson". I wish I had thought of it first.
