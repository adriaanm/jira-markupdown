Not only does it fail, but there is nothing which can be done in Y2 (e.g. overriding to resolve the ambiguity, even though neither m should even be inherited in Y2, let alone overridable) to make it compile. This is among the consequences of refusing to fix scala/bug#2568.
```scala
package s {
  trait B1 { private val m = "B1" }
  trait B2 { private[s] val m = "B2" }
}
class Y1 extends s.B1 with s.B2  // compiles
class Y2 extends s.B2 with s.B1  // fails

// ./a.scala:6: error: overriding value m in trait B2 of type String;
//  value m in trait B1 of type String has weaker access privileges; it should not be private
// class Y2 extends s.B2 with s.B1  // fails
//       ^
// one error found
```
