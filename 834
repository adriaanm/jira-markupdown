I'm compiling with scala-2.7.1.final.[[BR]]

I guess I must have modified the code a little bit to cause the OutOfMemoryError.

{code}
Component() propA "new A" propB "new B" propC "new C" propD "new D" propC "new C" propD "new D" propC "new C" propD "new D"
{code}

I just added a few more chained calls. 
The originally posted code, just caused an unusually long compile time (20 secs for a 25 LOC?)
