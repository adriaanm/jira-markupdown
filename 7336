I can't think of any codebase where having sealed not be transitive is used.

I would also argue that intuitively I expected it to be transitive, and I know at least a handful of people that did as well.

The only downside I see is there's no way to opt-out of being transitively sealed - such as a {{open trait B extends A}}.
