In the 2.8 nightly build (), scala.collection.mutable.Stack.elements returns a List in the reverse order it did in 2.7.4. This may be a feature, but it may be a bug. In 2.7.4, this ScalaCheck property check passed. In 2.8, it fails:

     (list: List[Int]) => {
        val stack = new Stack[Int]
        for (element <- list) stack.push(element)
        stack.elements.toList == list
      }

Here's why:

scala> import scala.collection.mutable.Stack
import scala.collection.mutable.Stack

scala> val stack = new Stack[Int]
stack: scala.collection.mutable.Stack[Int] = Stack()

scala> for (element <- List(1, 0)) stack.push(element)

scala> stack.elements.toList
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
res1: List[Int] = List(0, 1)

The iterator method has the same behavior:

scala> stack.iterator.toList
res2: List[Int] = List(0, 1)
