It'd be quite useful to have a possibility to write "typeOf(foo)" along with "typeOf[Foo]". A superficial experimentation session doesn't show any problems with typeOf[T] and typeOf[T](x: T) coexisting.

Inspired by http://blog-mno2.csie.org/blog/2011/12/24/what-are-data-dot-typeable-and-data-dot-dynamic-in-haskell/.
Moved the symbolOf aspect to #8194
Unfortunately, progress on this one is blocked by #8303: https://github.com/xeno-by/scala/commit/619dd6b96738fbd6fead79068bd04d56809186dd. Maybe third pull request will be the charm.
