We need to agree on whether we want C-style case indentation (going all the way back to goto label indentation as specified in the 70s, currently implemented) or something non-standard (suggested by the submitter). Of course, when it comes to indentation, everyone is religious. If you want to hack the plugin to make this configurable, I'm happy to accept the patch. But what is default should be decided by someone else. 

Re-indentation occurs because case is overloaded to mean case class or case object, so we don't know the indent until the user types the next token after case.
