That filter is only in place if inlining isn't on.  I don't have a good explanation for what seems like an unreasonable amount of indirection, but you can see it in the PathResolver constructor. 

{code}
class PathResolver(settings: Settings, context: JavaContext) {
  def this(settings: Settings) = this(settings, if (settings.inline.value) new JavaContext else DefaultJavaContext)
{code}

{noformat}
% scala3 -Yinline

scala> global.definitions.getClass("scala.collection.immutable.MapLike$class")
res0: global.Symbol = class MapLike$class
{noformat}
