= problem =
It is annoying to restart the REPL just to see some deprecation message, especially when there is already some amount of code evaluated.

= analysis =
There should be some way to activate things like "-migration", "-deprecation" without having to restart the REPL, maybe via some REPL command (those starting with ":").

= enhancement recommendation =
Add something like that.
There is already a way, although it's not well publicized.

{code}
scala> case class A
warning: there were 1 deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
defined class A

scala> :power
** Power User mode enabled - BEEP BOOP WHIR **
** scala.tools.nsc._ has been imported      **
** global._ and definitions._ also imported **
** New vals! Try repl, intp, global, power  **
** New cmds! :help to discover them         **
** New defs! Type power.<tab> to reveal     **

scala> settings.deprecation.value = true

scala> case class A
<console>:1: warning: case classes without a parameter list have been deprecated;
use either case objects or case classes with `()' as parameter list.
       case class A
                   ^
{code}

Migration:

{code}

scala> settings.Xmigration28.value = true

scala> Iterator.empty.collect { case x => x }
<console>:22: warning: method collect in trait Iterator has changed semantics:
This collect implementation bears no relationship to the one before 2.8.
The previous behavior can be reproduced with toSeq.
       Iterator.empty.collect { case x => x }
                      ^
res0: Iterator[Nothing] = empty iterator
{code}
Would it be possible to have shortcurts for it, like
{{ :deprecation }}, {{ : migration }}
and changing the warning messages to point to them?
(extempore in [r25467|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25467]) Don't discard deprecation/unchecked warnings regardless of settings.

Changed warnings code to accumulate them rather than thoughtlessly
discarding them and issuing its well-known taunt.  In the repl you
can take advantage of this with the :warnings command, which will show
the suppressed warnings from the last line which had any. Be advised
that at the moment it has some issues: unchecked warnings aren't
making it out, and near repl startup neither are deprecation warnings,
so don't open a bunch of tickets please.
