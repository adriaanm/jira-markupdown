I found no way to specify the second method (the one with a single argument). I think it is obvious here it should have been chosen (I know both are legitimate, but it is the more constraint)

There was a recent attempt to fix this in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4242 / https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4440, but to do so requires changes to the specification for overload resolution (which add undesirable complexity). 

The workaround at the moment is to indirect through forwarder method that you author in Java.
