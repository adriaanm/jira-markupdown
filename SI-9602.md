If you define a method that requires evidence for `A =:= B`, but then call some method that wants evidence for `B =:= A`, it will not compile, even though conceptually type equality is commutative.

It is possible to augment the definition to include a notion of commutivity, as in the following demonstration:

```scala
object commutative {
  import scala.annotation.implicitNotFound

  @implicitNotFound(msg = "Cannot prove that ${A} =::= ${B}.")
  sealed class =::=[A, B]
  object =::= {
     // type A is equal to itself
     implicit def eqAA[A]: =::=[A, A] = new =::=[A, A]

     // if B equals A, then A equals B
     implicit def eqAB[A, B](implicit eq: B =::= A): =::=[A, B] = new =::=[A, B]
  }

  // requires evidence for 'B equal A'
  def inner[A, B](implicit eqAB: B =::= A) = 0

  // requires evidence for 'A equal B'
  def outer[A, B](implicit eqAB: A =::= B) = inner[A, B]

  // compiles as desired
  val r = outer[Int, Int]

  // this fails (also as desired)
  // would like this to fail with 'implicitNotFound' message above,
  // but it fails with "diverging implicit expansion" message
  val fail = outer[Int, String]
}
```

Previous attempt at this: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3992. Read all the way down through the comments and see https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/9f493c3840ce46d4e0646d3085bfd5c89615e6f6

In general, Scala's implicit search isn't defined for arbitrary Prolog-style solving, and trying to encode transitivity and reflexitivy rules tend to have hard to spot and harder to solve corner cases.

@retronym the #3992 PR seems a lot more ambitious (and correspondingly controversial, side-effect-ful, etc) than what I'm after.   

Although what I'm proposing is arguably a bit prolog-like, it seems within the bounds of standard implicit resolution logic, imo.

Far as I can tell, the addition of commutivity logic works properly, with the exception that it seems to activate a different code path on failure that doesn't honor `implicitNotFound`.  That itself seems like a bug to me, although I'm curious about more expert opinion there.
