Moving a trait into a method and returning a class mixing in that trait
gets this error:

{code}
scala> class Bar
defined class Bar

scala> def f = { trait Foo; new Bar with Foo }
f: $$anon forSome { type $$anon <: Bar with Foo; type Foo <: java.lang.Object with ScalaObject }

scala> f
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : $$anon(in object $$iw) where type $$anon(in object $$iw) <: Bar with Foo
 required: $$anon(in value res0) forSome { type $$anon(in value res0) <: Bar with Foo; type Foo <: java.lang.Object with ScalaObject }
  val res0 =
      ^
{code}

I should note that compiling this code in a scala file runs just fine,
it's just that defining a function and then immediately calling it
should not cause an error in the scala interpreter.

This is a more general error that is not limited to the interpreter, presumably related to existentials.  The compiler itself will encounter problems with the following code:
{code}
object Test {
  class Bar
  def f = { trait Foo; new Bar with Foo }
  val x = f
}
{code}

This is another duplicate of SI-1201.
