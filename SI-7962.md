Inside Emacs's ansi-term, I can't run scalac, and the error I get is not so helpful:
```scala
$ scalac Hi.scala
Error: Could not find or load main class (term:0.96)
```
WTF? Inside the scalac script:
```scala
[[ -n "$EMACS" ]] && EMACS_OPT="-Denv.emacs=$EMACS"
```
Note that $EMACS is not quoted. Let's look at the value inside ansi-term:

```scala
$ echo $EMACS
24.3.1 (term:0.96)
```
Hence, `EMACS_OPT` will expand to `-Denv.emacs=24.3.1 (term:0.96)`, that is, two words.

Let's confirm expansion is indeed going wrong because of that.
```scala
$ bash -x $(which scalac) Hi.scala

Notice `-Denv.emacs=24.3.1 '(term:0.96)' scala.tools.nsc.Main`. That's the bad guy.

I could probably fix this problem, but I couldn't navigate to the exact location in the generator to fix it (or to the template, more likely) in the 5 minutes I have right now - I suspended on the call to `mk-bin` within `build.xml`. Otherwise, this might even be fixable within Github's web interface (of course one still needs to test it locally).
Also, it's probably a better time investment to review those scripts for space-safety more in general, since the impact of this particular bug is extremely limited.
For completeness, here's a works-for-me fix for the `scalac` script and this particular problem.

```
Ahem... The above fix breaks scalac outside of Emacs:
```
$ scalac *.scala
Error: Could not find or load main class
```
I guess that's because it adds an empty parameter, which java (understandably) mistakes for the name of the main class. However, the only alternative I could think of doesn't work either, because it EMACS_OPT is still expanded to multiple arguments, while it needs to expand as either zero or one.

I fear one needs to only quote the content of `$EMACS`, replacing space by backslash space. I'm troubled by not finding any standard solution to this problem.
