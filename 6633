As an aside, looking at `scala -help` I can see that the format is
```
scala <options> [<script|class|object|jar> <arguments>]
```

However, if I run
```
scala HelloWorld -J-help
```

Then the `scala` script is treating `-J-help` as an **option**, when according to the usage grammar, it should be treating it as an **argument** and shouldn't be doing anything with it apart from passing it to `main`, so there is definitely something not right with the script.
