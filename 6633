As an aside, looking at {{scala -help}} I can see that the format is

{noformat}
scala <options> [<script|class|object|jar> <arguments>]
{noformat}

However, if I run

{noformat}
scala HelloWorld -J-help
{noformat}

Then the {{scala}} script is treating {{-J-help}} as an *option*, when according to the usage grammar, it should be treating it as an *argument* and shouldn't be doing anything with it apart from passing it to {{main}}, so there is definitely something not right with the script.
