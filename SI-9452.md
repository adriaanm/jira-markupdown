Perhaps there's a reason this hasn't already been done, but it would seem trivial to have `BigDecimal` and `BigInt` implement `java.lang.Comparable` with passthrough to the underlying.

I'm having some (unnecessary?) interop issues because of this.
I think the long-term idea was to align some types closer with the Java ones #9080

This could be another case although the compare vs. compareTo will complicate things.
@ShaneDelmore are you working on a fix?
@Ichoran any history on this you're aware of?
@SethTisue Yes, I am working on this.
