Perhaps there's a reason this hasn't already been done, but it would seem trivial to have {{BigDecimal}} and {{BigInt}} implement {{java.lang.Comparable}} with passthrough to the underlying.

I'm having some (unnecessary?) interop issues because of this.
I think the long-term idea was to align some types closer with the Java ones https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9080

This could be another case although the compare vs. compareTo will complicate things.
[~shanedelmore] are you working on a fix?
[~ichoran] any history on this you're aware of?
[~sethtisue] Yes, I am working on this.
