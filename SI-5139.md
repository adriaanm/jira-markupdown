You would expect updated to only create a new instance if the value is indeed a different value than what is already in the map. This should be pretty easy to implement by checking for reference equality in the updated0 implementation methods of HashMap, HashMap1 and HashTrieMap.
Map.remove (- operator) also is affected. Fixing this should also be just a one line fix.

scala> val a=Map((1 to 10).map(x=>x->x):_*)
a: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,Int] = Map(5 -> 5, 10 -> 10, 1 -> 1, 6 -> 6, 9 -> 9, 2 -> 2, 7 -> 7, 3 -> 3, 8 -> 8, 4 -> 4)

scala> val b=a-10000
b: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,Int] = Map(5 -> 5, 10 -> 10, 1 -> 1, 6 -> 6, 9 -> 9, 2 -> 2, 7 -> 7, 3 -> 3, 8 -> 8, 4 -> 4)

scala> a eq b
res36: Boolean = false

scala> a == b
res37: Boolean = true

So, if I assign an AST tree to an existing key in a map, it will _traverse all AST_ just to check whether it is equal or not to the exiting value? That looks extremely suboptimal to me. Or are you just doing reference equality checks? I tried to check what your patch does, but you did not submit a patch -- you submitted the whole edited file. Don't do that, please -- diff was invented 40 years ago, so there's no reason not to use it.
Hi Daniel. I am just doing a reference equality check. The changes are pretty similar to what was done on scala.collection.immutable.Set in response to SI-4398. Sorry about not submitting a patch.
This was fixed in the process of fixing SI-5879 (which is not yet completely fixed, but anyway).

So I think this can be closed.
Fixed by rework of updated0 in SI-5879
