E.g. one can't use untyped macros to implement vararg type parameters.
I would like to be able to have type arguments with unspecified kind, ie. given Foo, Bar[_], Baz[_, _] etc. I would like to able to write a type macro which could be applied to all of them, ie. TypeMacro[Foo], TypeMacro[Bar], TypeMacro[Baz] given the above definitions. For applications see [kind polymorphism in GHC](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.4.1/html/users_guide/kind-polymorphism-and-promotion.html).

Something along these lines could also provide smoother mechanism for type constructor partial application.
