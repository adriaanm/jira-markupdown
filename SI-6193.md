while refining my fix for #5739, I discovered case field accessors are not considered pure -- or so it seems...

shouldn't the body of `emptyMethod` be completely empty when compiled with -optimize?

```scala
case class Foo(bla: Int, blaa: String)

class Test {
  val f = Foo(1, "1")
  // when compiled with -optimize, this method's body should be empty
  // however, both calls to the accessors survive (though they are not stored in local variables)
  def emptyMethod = {
    val x = f.bla // should be considered pure and be eliminated
    val y = f.blaa
  }
}
```
