Can't see how to fix it for 2.10. Here's the commit message I just wrote for the partial backport.

    SI-6566, unsoundness with alias variance [backport]
    
    This is only a partial backport, and does not include the
    most important part, but it is the part which I could reasonably
    backport. The rest relies on my overhaul of variance which
    takes it out of reach for 2.10.x.
    
    What is included here are the type soundness fixes in
    the collections library. Which, come to think of it, won't
    be binary compatible so this whole effort is doomed.
