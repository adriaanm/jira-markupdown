The following code compiles fine with scalac 2.9.2 but causes version 2.10.0 to crash:
{code:title=Test.scala}
trait C1[A] {
  def m1(key: A)
  def m2() {}
}

trait C2[A] extends C1[A] {
  abstract override def m1(key: A) { super.m1(key) }
}

class C3[A] extends C1[A] {
  override def m1(key: A) {}
}

class Test {
  val c = 2 match {
    case 1 => new C3[String] with C2[String]
    case _ => null
  }
}
{code} 
Compiling above code first reports the following error:
```
Test.scala:16: error: Member method m1 of mixin trait C2 is missing a concrete super implementation.
    case 1 => new C3[String] with C2[String]
```
and then compiler crashes during mixin phase (full error report is attached)
This is as far as I was able to simplify the case. Further reduction makes the issue completely or partially go away.
For example commenting out m2 method definition in C1 trait prevents compiler from crashing while still reports syntax error.
Removing match statement or introducing named class make the error go away completely.
Either case is compiled without errors or warnings by scalac 2.9.2
This doesn't crash anymore (since 2.10.1). It seems to have been fixed by the fix for #5189: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/8fb19b132579b7ddb9dd12ae829451dcf9d91332
