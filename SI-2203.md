{code}
class A[T](f: Int => Collection[T]) {
  "foo"
  "bar"
  "some stuff"
  val q = f(5)
}
{code}
{code}
a.scala:5: warning: type Collection in package object package is deprecated: use Iterable instead
  val q = f(5)
      ^
{code}
(In the particular case where I encountered this, the first usage was 50 lines from the declaration which needed changing.) More problematic still is that if the deprecated element is not used locally, there is no warning.  This:
{code}
abstract class B[T] {
  val f: Collection[T] => byte
}
{code}
...compiles with -deprecation with no warning.
