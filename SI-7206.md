{code}
object E extends Enumeration {
  val V = Value
}

sealed case class C(e: E.Value)

class Test {
  def foo(c: C) {
    c match {
      case C(E.V) => {}
    }
  }

  def foo2(e: E.Value) {
    e match {
      case E.V => {}
    }
  }
}
{code}

This code produces the following warning in Test.foo:

{code}
Test.scala:9: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: C((x: E.Value forSome x not in V))
    c match {
    ^
{code}

Test.foo2 produces no warning (as expected), even though it's essentially the same match.

Would it be feasible to make {{Enumeration}} use case classes internally so as to benefit from the exhaustiveness checks performed on those?
