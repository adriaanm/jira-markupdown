Ha, but of course the actual answer is that `toSeq` is asymptotically 2x slower than it needs to be (and up to 5x on small sizes?!?!) because of too much code reuse and the wrong choice of whether the map should iterate itself (yes!) or the buffer should with `++=` (no!--the map knows how to do it fastest, and buffer `+=` is supposed to be fast).

So we can fix this to use e.g. `Vector` and still come out ahead on the first conversion.  Whether it works as well thereafter will depend on what's being done to the `Seq`.  In most cases we could be a faster yet with `WrappedArray`, but maybe structural sharing in e.g. `Vector` will be worth it?
