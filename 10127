what prompted the change was scala/bug#5009 and scala/bug#5118

i see that we don't generate copy when there's a by-name (https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Unapplies.scala#L186), but i don't remember why.. it should be either changed, or added to the spec
