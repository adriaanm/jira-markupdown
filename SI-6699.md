(Sorry, I can't create anything less than a BLOCKER bug report.)

I would expect that creating a `BigDecimal` from a `Double` would produce a `BigDecimal` that returns `BigDecimal.isValidDouble = true`, e.g.

(Note: in the following, we don't care about loss of precision when inputting a double literal, the fact that whatever is stored is represented as a `Double` is enough)

  println(BigDecimal(10.1: Double).isValidDouble) // false

but the above actually prints `false`.


WORKAROUND: I use my own replacement for `.isValidDouble` which is to create a new BigDecimal from the output of a `toDouble` conversion

  val sd = BigDecimal(10.1: Double)
  println(sd == BigDecimal(sd.toDouble)) // true

If the `BigDecimal` -> `Double` conversion loses precision, then this test fails. e.g.

  val ssd = BigDecimal("1.0000000000000003")
  println(ssd == BigDecimal(ssd.toDouble)) // false

as expected.
Hi

I have no rights to commit to Scala git repository, so please find below the working code for BigDecimal.isValidDouble:

  def isValidDouble = {
    val d = toDouble
    !d.isInfinity && bigDecimal.compareTo(new java.math.BigDecimal(jl.Double.toString(d), mc)) == 0
  }
Hi Alex

I've submitted a pull request for #6699 fix.

Thanks,

The problem here is exacerbated because someone believed javadoc that said you should use `BigDecimal.valueOf` to create `BigDecimal`s.  (Unfortunately the justification given in javadocs is that it goes through the string representation!)

This keeps you consistent with the printed-out version of your doubles, but it doesn't keep you consistent in any other way.  All your internal numbers may be randomly different from each other (after a bit of math).

I recommend switching to purely non-string-based conversions wherever possible.

Here's an example of the problem as it currently exists:

```scala
val l = (1L << 62L)
val d = l.toDouble
l == d // true
BigDecimal(l) == BigDecimal(d)  // false?!
l == BigDecimal(l)  // true
d == BigDecimal(d)  // false?!
```

To recover transitivity of equals, it is necessary to switch away from taking the `doubleValue.toString` representation as the canonical one for initializing `BigDecimal`.

Unfortunately, if people are relying upon this strange string conversion thing for BigDecimal, changing it could break e.g. financial software.  That's generally something you don't want broken.
