When the Scala Eclipse plugin is installed, EclEmma  ( http://www.eclemma.org/ ) fails to display text highlighting, vertical ruler annotations, and overview annotations in the Java Editor Area. 

(EclEmma's Label decorations in Package and Outline view work well, as does the Coverage view. Only the Java Editor Area is affected.)

When I uninstall the 2.7.3 plugin and restart Eclipse (and re-run a Coverage run), I can see EclEmma's Java Editor annotations. When I reinstall the 2.7.3 plugin (and re-run a Coverage run), I cannot see EclEmma's Java Editor annotations.

I see this problem in the Java Perspective, where I'd expect the Scala plugin would not be touching anything.

I have no idea why these two plugins interfere.

I'm seeing this behavior on Mac and Linux Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede.
