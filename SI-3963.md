Currently, if a type parameter is ommitted the compiler assumes the lower bound, for instance
```scala
val s = Set() // yields Set[Nothing]
```
It would be great to have a means to override this behavior just like
```scala
class A[T = Any]
val a = new A // should yield A[Any]
```
Would you like me to provide some daily-life example for this requirement?
