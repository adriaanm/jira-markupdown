In Java, a == Float.NaN should return false, that's right, but in Scala, according to Programming In Scala, Page 567:
"Scala treats == as if it was deÔ¨Åned as follows in class Any
```scala
final def == (that: Any): Boolean = 
  if (null eq this) {null eq that} else {this equals that}
```
"

Thus, if "a.equals(Float.NaN)" returns true, then "a == Float.NaN" should also return true. That's why I filed this ticket.
