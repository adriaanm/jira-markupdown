You're wasting a perfectly good bit there, bub!
{code}
scala> class Foo { lazy val bar = 5 }                                           defined class Foo

scala> val x = new Foo                        
x: Foo = Foo@c7f3e3

scala> val f = x.getClass.getField("bitmap$$0")
f: java.lang.reflect.Field = public volatile int Foo.bitmap$$0

scala> def isEvaluated = (f.getInt(x) & 1) != 0
isEvaluated: Boolean

scala> isEvaluated
res0: Boolean = false

scala> x.bar
res2: Int = 5

scala> isEvaluated
res3: Boolean = true
{code}
Which is not to say this approach doesn't have a certain fragility and oh so slight implementation dependence... but I see no reason there couldn't be an interface to the data.
