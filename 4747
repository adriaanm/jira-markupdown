I see -- there seems to be some kind of inconsistency, though:
```scala
public interface Processor {
  Object process(Object request); 
  Object process2(Object request, String... parameter); 
}
```
```scala
class P1 extends Processor{
  def process(request: AnyRef) : AnyRef = request
  def process2(request: Any /*AnyRef is not accepted here*/, parameter: String*) : AnyRef = request.asInstanceOf[AnyRef] 
}
```
