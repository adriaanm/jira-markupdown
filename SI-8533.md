Such macro will compile, but fails to expand.

Adding '0' suffix to names of variables is a workaround.
Sounds like a second helping of SI-8425.
PS: Because it is my hobby to point out fun issues with hygiene and quasiquotes, putting `1 to 10` in a quasiquote is unsafe as you can't be sure that the extension method `to` will always be the same one, it depends on the context of the call site. `new _root_.....Range(1, 10)` would be safer.
