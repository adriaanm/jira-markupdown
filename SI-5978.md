v: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17)

Further Notes: Sometimes this problem can be temporarily fixed by rebooting, but eventually it reappears. Sometimes it can also be temporarily fixed by killing all the scala and java background processes that the interpreter starts, but again it reappears. This problem has been seen as far back as 2.8.
Not excusing the bug, but if you're after a workaround, try `scala -nocompdaemon`.
