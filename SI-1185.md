I have no idea what's going on here. I've attached a test case which when compiled and run throws a java.lang.IllegalAccessException. As best as I can tell it's minimal. 
Confirmed for version 2.7.2.r16011-b20080904010059
Here is a shorter piece of code that shows the same behaviour:

Test{
  private[this] var member = 0;

  def foo() = {
    (() => member=1)()
  }
}

object Main{
  def main(args : Array[String]){
    new Test().foo();
  }
}
