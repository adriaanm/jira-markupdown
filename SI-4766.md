Using > as a property that returns a number causes the compiler to crash.

```scala
object Bug extends App {
  val x = new {
    def > = 1
  }

  println(x>)
}
```
@Jason: The bug is listed as #4766. Is there anything I'm missing here?
(extempore in [r25965](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25965)) Fixing logic in structural types.

Closes #4766, no review.
