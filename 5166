I second that.

A year down the line, I'm starting to ask myself if I should have taken the Scala road at all. 

Sometimes this whole ecosystem seems too flaky to believe.

The proffered solution is either:

A) Upgrade everything to nightly

OR

B) Download and install a tool from someone I've never heard of, which updates itself from god only knows where and does something that I don't understand to a load of my production binary files. 
Last time that happened it was a present from the Cult of the Dead Cow.

Both of the above are extremely lame. Extremely lame for a project that's trying to be taken seriously. And that writes a ton of books about how great it is.

Here's how I read the situation:

2 months ago we released a STABLE release of our much vaunted, non-binary compatible between releases project. 

Unfortunately, (especially as one of our main selling points is binary compatibility with Java), our project is not binary compatible with Java as it generates invalid class files.

We've fixed it in Version Control and will bundle it with our next release, which will occur at some indeterminate time in the future. 

In the meantime you can all just sit on your hands because you can't integrate your Scala libraries with your Java systems.

Oh, alternatively you could download all your Scala dependencies and recompile them to the (unreleased) 2.9.0.

Except they break.

Right now we're too busy writing research papers, inventing new words, writing books about how great the system is or doing consultancy to bother with this, the actual business of writing software.
