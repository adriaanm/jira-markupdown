When object is of the same name as a type alias in the same package, object can only be used once. 

For instance:

{code}
    scala> import alias._
    import alias._

    scala> Foo(1)
    res0: alias.Box[Int] = Box(1)

    scala> Foo(1)
    <console>:11: error: alias.Foo.type does not take parameters
                  Foo(1)
                     ^
{code}

h4. Expected
Either compilation fails, or you can use the object the second time, same as the first.
Also, some useful error message, the actual behaviour has very little to do with the cause.

h4. Reproducible
Always, under both Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.4

To reproduce simply run sbt console and then the above.

h4. Notes
The type alias is otherwise unused.

h4. Workaround
Declare the object inside a trait and have the package object extend the trait
