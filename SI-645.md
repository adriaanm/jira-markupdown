Given the following code declaration:

{code}

class Property[+A] {
 type getter = () => (t forSome { type t <: A});
 type setter = (t forSome { type t <: A}) => Unit;
}

{code}

The eclipse compiler will show:
{code}
covariant type A occurs in invariant position in type () => t forSome { type t <: A } of type getter  managedBeans/src/org/scales/utils       Property.scala
covariant type A occurs in invariant position in type (t forSome { type t <: A }) => Unit of type setter  managedBeans/src/org/scales/utils       Property.scala
{code}

This however is not a problem for the normal 2.7.0-final compiler,
which compiles without warning / error.

This stops compilation of both that class file and of course the rest of the project.

Bizzarely it seems to stop the generation of classfiles for those classes which do compile.  I assume that this is just because its found an error during compilation and doesn't exhaustively try to compile the rest, as the JDT does.

Editing the file is fine, and content assist seems to work great.
