Running

```scala
import scala.actors._
//Actor.self
val channel = new Channel[Unit]
channel ! ()
```

results in

```scala
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at scala.actors.Channel.$$bang(Channel.scala:61)
        at Main$$$$anon$$1.<init>((virtual file):9)
```

This is probably because of how Channel.recv is initialised.

```scala
private[actors] var recv: Actor = {
  // basically Actor.self, but can be null
  Actor.tl.get.asInstanceOf[Actor]
}
```

If you uncomment `Actor.self` in the example snippet then the code works fine.

This error occurrs in 2.8.0.r17285-b20090312020918, but I'm pretty sure it's been around for a while.
> The error is frustrating for me, because I want the code to work whether it is the first thing that happens on a thread or not. But maybe I'm using Channel wrong in some way?

I'm not sure if the way you're using it is "wrong."  It sounds a little odd but reasonable.  The thing is not using "self" when the Channel is constructed appears to be a very conscious design decision, although it might be based on historic needs that no longer apply.  recv is private[actors], which usually indicates that it will be twiddled somewhere else in the library.  However it still compiles if you remove the package qualifier, so it currently is not being twiddled.  If the library intended to set the value sometime after construction, then it would make sense to not create an ActorProxy for it.

My instinct would be to drop recv, make receiver a val instead of a def, and provide an alternate constructor that sets receiver to Actor.self.  I'll give that a shot and see what the result is.

I'd also like to hear from Philipp on it, since not initializing self was clearly a conscious decision.

Yes, it does look like a conscious design decision. Here's the code at the moment.

```scala
class Channel[Msg] extends InputChannel[Msg] with OutputChannel[Msg] {

  private[actors] var recv: Actor = {
    // basically Actor.self, but can be null
    Actor.tl.get.asInstanceOf[Actor]
  }

  def receiver: Actor = recv

  def this(recv: Actor) = {
    this()
    this.recv = recv
  }
```

The "obvious" alternative (to me) would be to use `Actor.self` instead of accessing the `ThreadLocal` directly.

```scala
class Channel[Msg] extends InputChannel[Msg] with OutputChannel[Msg] {

  private[actors] var recv: Actor = Actor.self

  def receiver: Actor = recv

  def this(recv: Actor) = {
    this()
    this.recv = recv
  }
```

This would solve my problem. *However*, it would also mean that `Actor.self` is initialised - even when we don't need it. i.e. Even when an actor is explicitly passed in the constructor: `new Channel(anotherActor)`. I can see why this might be undesirable, because it could cause an `ActorProxy` to be created unnecessarily.

A way to avoid that problem would be to switch the constructors around like so.

```scala
class Channel[Msg](recv: Actor) extends InputChannel[Msg] with OutputChannel[Msg] {

  def receiver: Actor = recv

  def this() = this(Actor.self)
```

This means that `Actor.self` is no longer called by default.

Of course you can tidy it up a bit more: making `receiver` into a val, etc.

```scala
class Channel[Msg](val receiver: Actor) extends InputChannel[Msg] with OutputChannel[Msg] {

  def this() = this(Actor.self)
```

What do you think? It might still be a good idea to get Philipp's opinion on this one.
I was thinking something like this:
```scala
class Channel[Msg](val receiver: Actor) extends InputChannel[Msg] with OutputChannel[Msg] {
  /** Warning:  If there is no active actor this call will fail.
   *  If you want an ActorProxy to be created, use Channel[Msg](Actor.self) instead.
   */
  def this() = {
    this(Actor.tl.get)
    if (receiver eq null) throw new IllegalStateException("no actor is currently active")
  }
```
This keeps the semantics closer to what they are now, only it fails fast instead of when you try to use the Channel.  If the user wants an ActorProxy to be created if there isn't an active actor, then the user has to specifically code it.

That being said, I think your way is more intuitive.  ActorProxy's aren't heavy, so creating one doesn't hurt much, and they are created all over the place already.  It seems odd that they aren't here.

Let's see what Philipp has to say...
I think your way is better if we want to avoid creating an `ActorProxy` *at all*. I prefer my option if we only want to avoid creating an `ActorProxy` when we supply an `Actor` in the constructor, but we do want one automatically when we use the default constructor.

So I think it depends what the intended semantics are. The latter one makes more sense to me (of course!), but I don't know the full reason for Philipp's comment. I've sent an email to Philipp pointing him to this ticket, so we'll await his reply.
