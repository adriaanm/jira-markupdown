FactoryAdapter.startElement(...) fails on the declaration

{code}
var scpe = scopeStack.top
{code}

because scopeStack is empty.  The fix is to add

{code}
scopeStack push TopScope
{code}

to FactoryAdapter's constructor
adding this line to !NoBindingFactoryAdapter's constructor makes the problem go away (as in my attachment):
{code}
  scopeStack push TopScope
{code}
I put it there since I only use !NoBindingFactoryAdapter, I put the fix there instead of in !FactoryAdapter, where it was.
Noting regression was introduced in r19949 to fix SI-2721.
