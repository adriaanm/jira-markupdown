FactoryAdapter.startElement(...) fails on the declaration

```scala
var scpe = scopeStack.top
```

because scopeStack is empty.  The fix is to add

```scala
scopeStack push TopScope
```

to FactoryAdapter's constructor
adding this line to !NoBindingFactoryAdapter's constructor makes the problem go away (as in my attachment):
```scala
  scopeStack push TopScope
```
I put it there since I only use !NoBindingFactoryAdapter, I put the fix there instead of in !FactoryAdapter, where it was.
Noting regression was introduced in r19949 to fix #2721.
