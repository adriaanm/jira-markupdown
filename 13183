I expect this would be really hard to do but it would be nice if it were possible to give partest a command-line option telling it which runtime and/or VM to use.  It gets a little annoying having to keep writing things like
```scala
export PATH=/home/linuxsoft/apps/java-whatever/bin:$$PATH
```
To switch to a different runtime and/or VM to find out why something breaks on one, but not the others.  

In any event, in the short term I will probably write some ZSH macros to make this a little less verbose.
