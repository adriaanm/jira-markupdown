The following code shows that in some cases a by-name parameter is not
evaluated immediately:

```scala
scala> def f(block : => Unit) = { () => {println("calling block"); block } }
f: (=> Unit)() => Unit

scala> val g = f { println("doing work") }
g: () => Unit = <function>

scala> g()
calling block
doing work
```

It would be nice if the ScalaReference.pdf section 4.6.1 would add a
note on this indicating that this is the case.  I was reading the new
Scala book today and it used this to not immediately evaluate a by-name
parameter.
If I understand your example correctly, this works exactly as would be expected from call-by-name evaluation as described in the Scala Reference.  It says "This indicates that the corresponding argument is not evaluated at the point of function application, but instead is evaluated at each use within the function."  `block` is not actually used until the closure `g` is invoked, so this behaves as described.
