When I try to compile oauth.scalar1 with the command:
```scala
~/Download/scala/scala-2.7.3.r17424/bin/scalac -cp oauth-core-20090408.jar:. oauth.scala
```

I get:
```scala
error: error while loading OAuthClient, class file 'oauth-core-20090408.jar(net/oauth/client/OAuthClient.class)' is broken
(class java.util.Map$$Entry not found.)
one error found
```

The command above was for the latest (r17424) of the 2.7.x branch (soon to be 2.7.4-rc1). I also tried 2.7.3 and r17458 from trunk with the same results.

Note that this requires the oauth-core jar available from:

http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/maven/net/oauth/oauth-core/20090408/oauth-core-20090408.jar

I will try to produce a reduced set of Java files that can cause this behaviour, but wanted to register the problem here in case someone has an idea of what could cause the issue.

It seems like the issue is caused by the the loading order. When the example was a bit larger, removing OAuthMessage from the parameter would cause things to work fine even though the class considered broken was referenced.

r1 oauth.scala
```scala
package test

import net.oauth.OAuthMessage

class OAuthClassBroken {
  def createOAuthAccessor(message: OAuthMessage) = null
}
```
