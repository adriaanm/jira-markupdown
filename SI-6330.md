one.scala:
trait X { def f(p: scala.tools.selectivecps.CPSUtils) = null }

two.scala:
class Y extends X

mkdir bin
scalac -cp continuations.jar -d bin one.scala
scalac -cp bin -d bin two.scala

Second call to scalac causes the compiler crash included in the attachment.

Note that this has nothing to do continuations.jar; any JAR will do, provided it is omitted from the second compilation. Continuations.jar was chosen because it's part of the standard distribution and isn't on the default classpath.
In 2.10.x it does this

error: bad symbolic reference. A signature in X.class refers to term selectivecps
in package scala.tools which is not available.
It may be completely missing from the current classpath, or the version on
the classpath might be incompatible with the version used when compiling X.class.
one error found.
