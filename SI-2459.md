Hi,


when I format code I'd it to produce something like:
```scala
def a:Int = {....
}

override def b:String = {....
}

def c:BigInt = { ....
}
```

instead it does something like:

```scala
def a:Int = {....
}

override def b:String = {....
                }

                def c:BigInt = { ....
                }
```
it seems that the closing brace is placed on the same tab stop as the 'def' and any following 'def' on the same tabstop as the last closing brace. Shouldn't override count as the start of the definition in this case? 
Further experiment seems to indicate that it has something to do not with the override-modifier but with the lack of parameter list parentheses. Add some and it works again

Demo:
```scala
class FormattingBug {
def a:Int = {
1
}

def b() :Int = {
1	
}

}
```

Try Mark All then Indent and look at the result, after this try:
```scala
class FormattingBug {
def a():Int = {
1
}

def b() :Int = {
1	
}

}
```

Again, Mark All --> Indent
