It's also interesting to note that the full signature for `Map#map` is also misleading:

{code}
Full Signature
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That
{code}

Disambiguating:

{code}
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B/*a type parameter of class Map*/)) ⇒ B /*a type parameter of method map*/) ...
{code}
