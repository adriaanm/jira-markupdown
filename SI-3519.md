With Scala 2.7.x, it was possible to run a Scala REPL on Google AppEngine, because the compiler's file access is all virtualized.

This is broken by change r21323, as AppEngine does not support File.createTempFile, which is now called unconditionally.

Perhaps createTempFile could be wrapped to catch SecurityExceptions?
I did some hacking on the source to get the interpreter working again on AppEngine; I'd consider submitting a patch/commit but I'm not familiar with the procedure.  But I think I understand the extent of the problem and how it might be fixed.

The createTempFile problem in nsc.io.File could be fixed as follows (I added IOException just for good measure):
```scala
  // this is a workaround for http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6503430
  // we are using a static initializer to statically initialize a java class so we don't
  // trigger java.lang.InternalErrors later when using it concurrently.
  {
    try {
      val tmp = JFile.createTempFile("bug6503430", null, null)
      val in = new FileInputStream(tmp).getChannel()
      val out = new FileOutputStream(tmp, true).getChannel()
      out.transferFrom(in, 0, 0)
    }
    catch {
      // no problem if we don't have write access to the file system
      case _: SecurityException => ()
      case _: IOException => ()
    }
    ()
  }
```

There is one additional problem which is that nsc.Interpreter uses a future, which fails creating the thread pool (you can't create threads on AppEngine).  I would settle for being able to subclass Interpreter in a way that initializes the compiler synchronously, for example "override def initializeCompilerAsync = false", or some less contrived way.

Thanks for the response.
Closing this as a sort of duplicate, using #4734 for the more general issue.
