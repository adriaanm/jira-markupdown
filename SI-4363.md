See also #2897, #4202.  I'm calling this a different bug because it is only incurred if there is an override.
```scala
object Test {
  trait Suite { def bar() = () }

  () => {
    trait FunkySuite extends Suite { override def bar() = () }
    class MySuite extends FunkySuite { }
  }
}
```
Also of interest is that this is the usage pattern which generates names like $$class$$1.  I presently have a comment in NameManglers about this issue, because in fixing another bug I discovered that such named classes exist and are not correctly recognized.
```scala
/** !!! Foo$$class$$1 is an implClassName, I think.  */
def isImplClassName(name: Name)         = name endsWith IMPL_CLASS_SUFFIX
```
The code up top fails:
```scala
assertion failed: method $$init$$ in object Test$$$$anonfun$$1$$FunkySuite$$class$$1 in package <empty>

(In r24527) Closes #4202 again, closes #4363. if someone can enlighten me why we actually had that exclusion for companion objects in the first place I would be grateful. review by odersky
Oh, in #4202 I answered (actually "answer" is ambitious, but "provided data regarding") the question above but I'll put it here too:

r8575
"fixed gilles problem with spurious recursive types"
