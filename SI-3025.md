/trunk/src/textwrangler/Scala_Configuration.plist does not load in the latest TextWrangler (3.1), because the BBLMLanguageCode element should be limited to 4 characters. Modified Scala_Configuration.plist is attached to resolve this.

Changes:

- BBLMLanguageCode key changed from Scala to Scal

- BBLMDroppedFilePathStyle removed (unnecessary in .plist plug-ins, only for SDK use)

- Strings keys modified to proper format (Open Strings 1, Close Strings 1, etc)

- Open Statement Blocks typo fixed

- Prefix for Functions key added to enable TW's dropdown menu of functions. It will not work for functions defined without {} blocks, but this is no big deal since such functions are probably short enough not to need the function scanning.
(In r20821) New Textwrangler plist file, contributed by mkincaid.
Closes #3025.
