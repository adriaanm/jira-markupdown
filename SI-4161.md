=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

{code}
  List(1, 1, 1, 1).scanRight(0)(_+_)
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

As in Haskell:

{code}
Hugs> scanr (+) 0 [1, 1, 1, 1]
[4,3,2,1,0]
{code}


=== What do you see instead? ===

{code}
scala> List(1,1,1,1).scanRight(0)(_+_)
res1: List[Int] = List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
{code}


=== Additional information ===

{{scanRight}} is implemented at {{TraversableLike}} and also at {{TraversableViewLike}}, {{TraversableProxyLike}} and {{ParSeqViewLike}}, though all of these just reference {{TraversableLike}}.

No other part of Scala's source make use of it, but it has been available since Scala 2.8.0, and merits a migration warning.

The present documentation is not very clear about the direction of the result, though I personally think it describes how it is presently working, not how it should (IMO) work.

Unfortunately, neither {{reduceRight}} nor {{foldRight}} serve as a parameter, since neither produce collections as result.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r0-b20101218005140
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_23
  - Operating system: Windows Vista 64
