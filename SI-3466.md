The following code behaves inconsistently when executed as it creates a forward reference to Wanted.Default:

{code}
object Wants {

  implicit val nope = new AnyRef with Wanted

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    import Wanted._
    println(nope eq implicitly[Wanted])
    println(Wanted.Default eq implicitly[Wanted])
    println(nope eq implicitly[Wanted])
  }
}

trait Wanted

object Wanted {
  implicit object Default extends Wanted
}
{code}

It produces the following output:
{code}
true
true
false
{code}

When moving {{object Wants}} to the bottom of the file the expected output is produced.
Also interesting is this alteration:
{code}
  implicit lazy val Default = new AnyRef with Wanted
  // implicit object Default extends Wanted
{code}
which fails to compile:
{code}
a.scala:8: error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both lazy value Default in object Wanted of type => java.lang.Object with Wanted
 and value nope in object Wants of type => java.lang.Object with Wanted
 match expected type Wanted
    println(Wanted.Default eq implicitly[Wanted])
                                        ^
a.scala:9: error: ambiguous implicit values:

 and value nope in object Wants of type => java.lang.Object with Wanted

    println(nope eq implicitly[Wanted])
                              ^

{code}
I'd formed this idea that the existence of both lazy vals and object members is something of an accident of history and that they may be unified down the road.  If true we will need to ferret out these inconsistencies; if false it'd be nice if we could document them.
Actually this is the way it is described in the SLS ï¿½7.2 as far as I understand it. Wanted.Default is an implicit value of the type Wanted.Default.type that extends Wanted (i.e. not only of type Wanted). Following the rules defined in that section it gets selected because it is the most specific argument provided. That would explain why you get the same output if you change it e.g. to

{code}
implicit lazy val Default = new Something with Wanted
{code}

So even if you would unify them - in this case the problem would remain unless you change the rules for providing implicit arguments.

Even more confusing is this one:

{code}
case class X(y: Int)

implicit def int2xM(i: Int) = X(i)

implicit val int2xF: Int => X = X(_)

implicit object int2xO { def apply(i: Int) = X(i) }

def action[A <% X](a: A): X = a
{code}

Compiles fine - but without carefully reading the SLS you have no idea what is happening here (it's object before val before def in this case).
{code}
import scalaz._, Scalaz._
 
  class A {
    def F = new A === new A
  }
  object A {
    implicit object AEqual extends Equal[A] {
      def equal(a1: A, a2: A): Boolean = a1 == a2
    }
  }
{code}
this kind of code compiles for me with full recompilation with 2.10.2 and 2.10.3 and sbt 0.13, but stops compiling (implicit not found) with incremental compilation unless i move object A to the top of the file or replace  object AEqual with val AEqual: Equal[A] = new Equal[A] (note the explicit type), i also spuriously get the message from  SI-5197
