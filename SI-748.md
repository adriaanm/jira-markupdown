The following code produces an error
```scala
object test {
/*

/*

*/
}
```
However, the summary of syntax in Appendix A of the SLS says:
```scala
comment ::= ‘/*’ “any sequence of characters” ‘*/’
```
Section 1.4 does say that multiline comments may be nested, but does not express the requirement that they be properly nested.
