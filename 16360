Steps to reproduce (test code attached):

- define a function within the interpreter
- call it to make sure it works fine
- check that interpreter unqualifiedIds contain the function name
- reset the interpreter
- call the function. This does not work, as expected
- check that interpreter unqualifiedIds do not not contain the function name. This is the problem - unqualifiedIds *still* contain the function name

PS. This relates to code completion within Kojo
