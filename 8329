That was scala/bug#6120. Now it needs a dash of configurable reporter.
```scala
scala> object X { @deprecated("","") def x(): Int = 42 }
defined object X

scala> X x
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
res0: Int = 42

scala> :warnings
<console>:9: warning: method x in object X is deprecated:
              X x
                ^
<console>:9: warning: postfix operator x should be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.postfixOps visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.postfixOps'
or by setting the compiler option -language:postfixOps.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.postfixOps for a discussion
why the feature should be explicitly enabled.
              X x
                ^

scala> :replay -deprecation
Replaying: object X { @deprecated("","") def x(): Int = 42 }
defined object X

Replaying: X x
<console>:9: warning: method x in object X is deprecated:
              X x
                ^
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
res0: Int = 42
```
