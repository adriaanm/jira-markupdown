Looking at the compiled bytecode, {{Product}} really isn't listed as a direct interface. I presume the scalac compiler has removed it (but not from the Signature). The tool javap confusingly lists the generic direct interfaces, not the plain direct interfaces.

With a lower-level tool, you should see the actual interfaces. E.g. with ProGuard's {{-dump}} option:

{code}
java -jar proguard5.0/lib/proguard.jar \
  -dontshrink \
  -dontoptimize \
  -dontobfuscate \
  -dontpreverify \
  -dump \
  -injars lib/scala-library.jar'(scala/Tuple1.class)' \
| less
{code}

You'll then see
{code}
- Program class: scala/Tuple1
  Superclass:    java/lang/Object
.....
Interfaces (count = 2):
  - Class [scala/Product1]
  - Class [scala/Serializable]

.....
  - Signature attribute:
    - Utf8 [<T1:Ljava/lang/Object;>Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/Product1<TT1;>;Lscala/Product;Lscala/Serializable;]
{code}
Tools like asm or jad may provide the same information. Other tell-tale sign: {{scala/Product}} isn't present as a class constant in the bytecode.
