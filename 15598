When using windows newlines (\r\n), the AST positions sometimes include the \r in their position. For example:
```scala
package com.test
object Hello {
  def test = {
    val loc = 42
    loc * loc
  }
}
```
here the third `loc` has the position `RangePosition(test_0, 78, 78, 82)`. In the source, this is:
```scala
 r78	l	
 r79	o	
 r80	c	
 r81	\r	
 r82	\n	
```
