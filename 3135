Maybe this is the right place to raise another possible extension to the `implicit` modifier (which I couldn't find elsewhere - sorry if it is). Namely, given, e.g. 
```scala
trait MyStateMonad[F[_]] extends MonadState[F, Int]{
      import scalaz.syntax.monad._
      implicit val _ = this // necessary in order to use the syntactic sugar
      ...
}
```

it'd be nice to be able to write that just as follows:
```scala
trait MyStateMonad[F[_]] extends MonadState[F, Int]{ implicit this =>
      import scalaz.syntax.monad._
      ...
}
```
