I was going to be surprised if this still existed in trunk given the wide range of arity-mismatch things I've fixed, and indeed, it doesn't.
```scala
Bar.scala:1: error: class Bar needs to be abstract, since method foo in trait Foo of type [G[_]](implicit n: N[G,F])X[F] is not defined
(Note that N[G,F] does not match M[G])
class Bar[F[_]] extends Foo[F] {
      ^
one error found
```
Or, make Bar abstract and enjoy it compiling.  If that method is supposed to implement that other method, well I don't know about anyone else but I'd be pretty surprised if that worked (assuming it's supposed to.)
