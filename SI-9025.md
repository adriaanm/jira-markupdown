When object is of the same name as a type alias in the same package, object can only be used once. 

For instance:

{code}
    scala> import alias._
    import alias._

    scala> Foo(1)
    res0: alias.Box[Int] = Box(1)

    scala> Foo(1)
    <console>:11: error: alias.Foo.type does not take parameters
                  Foo(1)
                     ^
{code}

h4. Expected
Either compilation fails, or you can use the object the second time, same as the first.
Also, some useful error message, the actual behaviour has very little to do with the cause.

h4. Reproducible
Always, under both Scala 2.10.4 and 2.11.4

To reproduce simply run sbt console and then the above.

h4. Notes
The type alias is otherwise unused.

h4. Workaround
Declare the object inside a trait and have the package object extend the trait

note, this does cause compilation failures in multi-module builds where the module is several steps removed from the module where the object is referenced. Out initial symptom for instance was of the form:

{noformat}

[error] Cannot access type Functions in object io.atlassian.aws.AwsAction. The current classpath may be

{code}
scala> Foo(1).toString + Foo(1).toString
res0: String = Box(1)Box(1)
{code}
Hey, that's twice!

It does look like SI-7139 and predecessors.
[~apm] you are quite right, it is necessary for it to be used in two separate contexts, such as two separate module compilations, or two console lines.

Good find, this does seem a duplicate.
