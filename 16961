Problem with {{updateDynamic}}:
\\
If a dynamic field assignment is invoked within an expression (the type of the assignment invocation depends on the result type of method {{updateDynamic}}), then the compiler reports the error {{reassignment to val}}. 

{code}
scala> val foo = new A // A implements selectDynamic and updateDynamic
foo: A = A@71933d6c

scala> foo.xxx = 3
foo.xxx: Any = 3

scala> foo.xxx
res0: Any = 3

scala> println(foo.xxx = 3)
<console>:12: error: reassignment to val
              println(foo.xxx = 3)
                              ^

scala> val x = (foo.xxx = 3) == ()
<console>:11: error: reassignment to val
       val x = (foo.xxx = 3) == ()
                        ^
{code}
