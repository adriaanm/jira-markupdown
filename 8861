one possible response is, "what, you really expect -optimize not to cause tons of warnings?"

but actually, for whatever it's worth, RC2 with -optimize compiles my entire large codebase (100K+ lines of mixed Scala and Java) with no other warnings produced besides this one (246 times). tests pass, too. so I'm thiiiiiis close to being able to use -optimize and -Xfatal-warnings. which would be pretty cool and help the optimizer get tested.
