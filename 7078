That's a neat technique that I must remember - thanks. But alas, after some experimentation I don't think it can resolve my problem. You've made me aware that I really want to do mixin composition of Vector, more like:

class PhantomOfTheVector[A+, P] extends Vector[A] with Phantom[A, P]

I.e. make a Vector that also implements another interface, without wrapping it.
