Since {{newBuilder}} is protected, it's not straightforward to add an appropriate test to collections-laws.  And this is weird indeed since {{Traversable}} does the right thing while {{collection.Set}} does not.  So to properly test you need appropriate downcasting abstractions and then to try every downcast.
[~retronym] Are we sure that we _want_ to fix this?  Maps and sets are particularly vulnerable to very poor behavior if the wrong collection type is chosen; unless you're basically positive that the set is small, you're better off with a variant of {{HashSet}} than anything else.  There are no notes that I can see that explains why {{GenTraversableFactory}} uses a different approach than {{GenSetFactory}}--one defers to {{genericBuilder}} while the other calls {{newBuilder}}.  Maybe it's just a mistake.  But one could also argue that if you really _want_ a linear hash map, your types should reflect that.

One could also argue this for e.g. {{Seq}}, but there the argument is weaker given that the core computation that a set does is {{contains}}, which becomes {{O(n)}}, while indexing via {{apply}} is just one of a number of {{Seq}} goodies.  Plus, with {{Seq}} you can insist on {{IndexedSeqOptimized}} if you want good indexing.
[The Architecture of Scala Collections"|http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/architecture-of-scala-collections.html] includes an example of integrating new Set and Map collections. These exhibit the same behaviour as the standard ones.

I think it would be worthwhile asking [~odersky].
I expanded the tests to cover more collections (I hope I caught all relevant implementations): https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.12.x...szeiger:issue/8434

The test that are commented out all fail at the moment. When testing [~retronym]'s fix I discovered that his original tests in https://github.com/retronym/scala/tree/ticket/8434 and my expanded tests do not actually test the right thing though. The LinkedHashSet test succeeds even without the bug fix. The builders that are found do not only depend on the runtime type of the collection but also on the type as which it is statically seen. For example, LinkedHashSet seen as Set is currently broken, but LinkedHashSet seen as GenTraversableOnce works. For a comprehensive suite of tests, we'd have to test every combination of concrete collection constructor and all supertypes of the collection.

I also asked [~odersky] and he agrees that it is a bug. The current strawman proposals for a new collections implementation in Scala 2.13 and Dotty do not suffer from it. Therefore we may want to defer a more comprehensive fix to 2.13 and only patch up the concrete issues that were discovered so far.
