When passing null into a match expression with a Sequence Pattern, a null pointer exception occurs. But shouldn't the pattern automatically guard against it? The following case illustrates the problem:

```scala

def f(a:Array[Int]) = a match {
  case Array(1, _*) => "yes"
  case _ => "no"
}

```

Calling `f(null)`, I expect to get "no", but I get the null pointer exception instead.
