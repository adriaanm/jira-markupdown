This works:
```scala
object Test extends App {
  class A
  println(classOf[A].getSimpleName())
}
```

But this fails:
```scala
object Test extends App {
  object A {
    class B
  }
  println(classOf[A.B].getSimpleName())
```

for the same reason as Eugene stated. The first example works because we put A into 'Test' class and not 'Test$'. Note that class without dollar sign is generated only for top-level objects as a place where we can put static forwarders to object's method.
