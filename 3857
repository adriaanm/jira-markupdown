(In r21672) StringBuilder no longer violates the Seq reverse contract: it
returns a new StringBuilder.  The behavior formerly found in
reverse (updates in place) is now available in reverseContents.
Migration warning on reverse.  Closes SI-3327.

Also did some StringBuilder rewriting as per discussion with
odersky.  And took a cleaver to parts of the documentation to
get to the good parts a little faster.  Review by community.
