The MatchIterator returned by scala.util.matching.Regex.findAllIn is backed by a java.util.regex.Matcher, which throws IllegalStateExceptions if called before it had been initialized.

This behaviour is not documented in the Scaladoc, leading to a confusing user experience:
```scala
val msg = "I love Scala"
val start = " ".r.findAllIn(msg).start // throws an IllegalStateException
```
