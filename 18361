From reporter¹:
```scala
val tuple = 1 -> 1 / 0.1
val tupple2 = 1 → (1 / 0.1)
```

First line compiles just fine while second one requires parentheses because, according to my understanding of SLS "6.12.3 Inﬁx Operations", '{{→}}' as '(all other special characters)' have higher precedence than '{{/}}', while '{{\->}}' have lowest precedence because of first '{{\-}}'.

Martin says:

Once we specify that unicode  `→` is an alias for `->` it makes sense to rule that they have the same precedence.
