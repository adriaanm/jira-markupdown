The Scaladoc for Iterable lists several methods with the note "will not terminate for infinite collections".  In several cases this is not necessarily true.  For example, map on an infinite stream is just fine:
```scala
  Stream.from(0).map(x => x*x)
```
It is good to give the "will not" and "may not" terminate comments, because these are a true hazard when processing an arbitrary Iterable.  However, currently these comments are applied to too many methods.
