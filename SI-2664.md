This is an odd problem, since abstract override protected[pkg] works.

Example:
```scala
package pkg1 {
    class C {
        private[pkg1] def foo: Int
    }

    trait T extends C {
        abstract override private[pkg1] def foo = super.foo + 1
    }
}
```
```scala
error: `abstract' modifier can be used only for classes;
it should be omitted for abstract members
```

None of the combinations compile:
```scala
abstract override private[pkg]
abstract private[pkg] override
private[pkg] abstract override
```

Tested on 2.7.7.final and 2.7.3.final with the same result.
You may spot a missing function definition in the example, however it's not the problem. The following fixed code gives the same compiler error:
```scala
package pkg1 {
    class C {
        def foo: Int = 1
    }

    trait T extends C {
        private[pkg1] abstract override def foo = super.foo + 1
    }
}
```
All the correct combinations (and some incorrect as seen in the both examples above) were tested with the same result. The compiler does not get to the point to report any other errors.
```scala
package pkg1 {
    class C {
        private[pkg1] def foo: Int = 1
    }

    class T extends C {
        override def private[pkg1] foo = super.foo + 1
    }
}
```
