Executing any of the the commands

{code}
:cp /tmp/foo bar
:cp "/tmp/foo bar"
:cp """/tmp/foo bar"""
{code}

gets the following error message.

  :cp requires exactly one argument.

It would be helpful if there was a way to add a path with spaces to the classpath in the REPL.
(In r23708) Made it possible to give :cp an argument with spaces.  Closes SI-3819, no review.
