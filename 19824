power mode is experimental/unofficial so we don't normally open tickets on it, but at the very least, I think we should make sure the prompt doesn't sell you nonexistent goods (:vals doesn't exist, and power.<tab> does nothing)

** Power User mode enabled - BEEP WHIR GYVE **
** :phase has been set to 'typer'.          **
** scala.tools.nsc._ has been imported      **
** global._, definitions._ also imported    **
** Try  :help, :vals, power.<tab>           **

plan: wait for Jason's new REPL tab-completion to get merged, then change the prompt to reflect whatever the new status quo is.
