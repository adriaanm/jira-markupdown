To reproduce:

1. Type the following code:

package test

class TestCodeAssist {
  case class Birth(id: Int)

  Birth()
}

2. Place the cursor in between the brackets of "Birth()"

3. Press Ctrl-Space for content assist

4. Witness Eclipse will use 100% CPU and will not return

Perhaps it's searching for all possible values... :-)

In Eclipse, I would expect the possible constructors to use for Birth with their arguments listed in a pop-up.
