There is a regression in 2.11.7:
```scala
% ./scala -Xlint
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.7-20150512-102953-297eeb335c (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> "${}"
<console>:8: warning: possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
              "${}"
              ^
res0: String = ${}

scala> :quit
```

In 2.11.6 everything works fine:
```scala
% scala -Xlint  
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.6 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> "${}"
res0: String = ${}

scala> :quit
```
@som-snytt I think I reported something similar in the past and as far as I remember you fixed the problem. You may want to have a look to this one too.
It progressed in #9127, but doesn't inspect the expression yet. For record, it would interpolate parens.
The warning is selectively disabled by `-Xlint:-missing-interpolator,_`.
[This offering](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5053) ignores the empty expression. As a bonus Easter egg, an empty expression also short-circuits other missing-interpolator checks in the string. Ideally, the linter would check only non-empty expressions that parse, with idents that are names in scope.
