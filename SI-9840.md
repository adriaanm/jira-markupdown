The following code compiles with 2.12 (but it shouldn't) and doesn't compile with plain 2.11


```java
abstract class Node(name: String) {
  var value: Option[Boolean] = None
}

case class Group(name: String, nodes: Node*) extends Node(name) {
  override def value = ???

  override def value_=(b: Option[Boolean]) = ???

}
```
Fails as follows in 2.12.0-{M4,M5} for me. Expected to have a different failure mode when compiling under -Xexperimental due to -Yoverride-vars having been included (until recently).
 
```scala
/Users/adriaan/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC2016.2/scratches/scratch_7.scala:6: error: overriding variable value in class Node of type Option[Boolean];
 method value cannot override a mutable variable
  override def value = ???
               ^
/Users/adriaan/Library/Preferences/IdeaIC2016.2/scratches/scratch_7.scala:8: error: overriding variable value in class Node of type Option[Boolean];
 method value_= cannot override a mutable variable
  override def value_=(b: Option[Boolean]) = ???
               ^
two errors found
```
