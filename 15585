When the parsers that are constructed by parser combinators would have a filter method then they would work with for comprehensions even more effectively.

The following definition should work:
```scala
Parser[T] {
...
  def filter(p: T => Boolean) =
    this >> (x => if (p(x)) success(x) else failure("predicate not satisfied")) }
...
}
```
