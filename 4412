@Paul: While I agree that disallowing null would be a better choice altogether, Java `HashSet` can contain null.

If we are to allow null, the only (slightly dirty) solution I see is adding a null check to `HashSet` and a private boolean indicating whether null is in the set (another is wrapping entries, but that's inefficient).
