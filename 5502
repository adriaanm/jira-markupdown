extempore:

I quote the last commenter: 

"For the record, the patch for scala/bug#4067 is not sufficient and the dimensions of the problem aren't 100% clear yet, so nothing is going to happen too imminently."

So are you just telling me to shut up or does your posting indicate that this issue is being taken seriously?

If you heard me the first time, was that indicated by the totality of your response, "owner changed from scala_meeting to scala_reviewer"?

I also don't think your comment,"further exposition of your opinions regarding how we're measuring up to your standards is unlikely to accomplish anything" - is particularly mature, constructive or professional.

So what is the Scala project doing about this blocking issue?
