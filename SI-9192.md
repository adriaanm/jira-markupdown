A Scala IDE user reported a compiler blowup, which makes the IDE unusable: https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1002389?comment=695983983#/activity/ticket:

I managed to minimize the problem far enough to reproduce it on the commandline, see instructions here: https://github.com/sschaef/scoobi-blowup

Looking at the output of svelto (https://github.com/dragos/svelto), it seems that the compiler is doing too much work in the typechecker.


Here's a smaller minimization:

{code}
object X {
  implicitly[com.nicta.scoobi.core.WireFormat[Nothing]]
}
{code}

`-Xlog-implicits` shows that we are cutting off lots of divergent nested implicit searches. We tread a fairly perilous path with divergent implicits, it seems in this case we are too lenient and should call the whole search off rather than continuing. But it is hard to be sure about what's going on without first creating a smaller set of implicits that demonstrates the essense of Scoobi's `WireFormat` and `AvroSchema` implicits.

I remember that these implicits were involved in another compilation speed problem I spent some time on: https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/pull/324

AFAICT, this behaviour isn't a regression from 2.11.5, so I'm demoting it as a blocker for 2.11.6.
