Consider such code

    val x = Some(5)
    val y = 5

    println(x==y)

"false" will be printed. Actually, Scala compares those entities in such way that it will be ALWAYS false, so it is indication user didn't want to write the way she/he did (same case when you compare Int to null for example -- you will get at least warning). But here -- nothing, compiler happily compiles the code.

Possible solutions:
a) compiler should evaluate None == Value always to false, and Some(Value) == Value always to true (I prefer such solution)

b) forbid comparing Option[T] to T (compiler error)

b.1) or at least warning

Notice it warns the other way:
```scala
scala> println(y == x)
<console>:10: warning: comparing values of types Int and Some[Int] using `==' will always yield false
              println(y == x)
                        ^
```
a) is not going to happen, equals must be symmetric.  b) is not going to happen either.  A warning might be possible, but it's harder than it looks to warn where you want to without creating spurious warnings elsewhere.
If Some("a") == "a', how do you propose to modify final class String such that "a" == Some("a") ? If you think equals calls can be intercepted selectively, there is ("a": Object) == (Some("a"): Object).  If you think we would rewrite every equals call to achieve this end, there is still a whole universe of java code we don't compile but must interoperate with.  It is not no problem.  (This is before getting to the fact that even if it were easy and imposed no cost, we wouldn't do it because it isn't true: Some(x) is not x.)

Best to drift this over to the mailing list [scala-debate]; here isn't the right forum. BTW, `if (x == Some\(y)) ...` ain't so bad..
re x == Some\(y\), see #6064
