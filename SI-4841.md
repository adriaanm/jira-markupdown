Plugins get their own class loader, but there is not currently a way to put jars in this class loader except by declaring a jar to be a plugin.  If the jar doesn't contain a plugin, however, a warning is printed.

This enhancement requests either removing the warning (not the preferred solution) or adding a new option, such as '-Xpluginscp' that allows specifying additional jars to be available to plugins.  A patch is attached to demonstrate this.
I assume this isn't happening: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/x7kBYq6oDkI.

If not, all I would do is update the patch to compile against master and submit a pull request instead.  If that is fine, I'll do that.  Otherwise, I'd reassign back to scala-reviewer.

Adding a manifest Class-Path to the plugin.jar works in the usual way.  

It seems to me that the reason to have an option for a plugin class path is that two plugins have conflicting dependencies and you have to keep them separate; otherwise, using the compiler's class path suffices.

If a plugin-specific path is deemed a requirement, maybe make -Xplugin a path instead of a location.  One of the elements of the path better contain a plugin descriptor.  The first lucky location to define a plugin wins.  That path is used to load it, of course.

E.g., `-Xplugin:plugin1.jar:dep1.jar,plugin2.jar:dep2.jar,something.jar:plugin3.jar`

This implements that behavio(u)r:
