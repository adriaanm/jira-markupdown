In eclipse 3.3.1.1 with the latest plugin (installed via update site); do the following to reproduce:

* Create a scala class e.g. *Foo.scala*

* Right click on the new artifacts, choose refactor>rename and call it *Fool*

You will notice that the filesystem now contains Fool.java but internally the source still has class Foo.
