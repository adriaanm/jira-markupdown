Please take a look at the simple project attached, to reproduce the error run  

{code}mvn compile{code}

The same two-liner test is provided for Java (compiles) and for Scala (not compiling)

The sample makes uses of a Java interface {{CacheSet}} that has two similar methods going upwards in its hierarchy:

* stream() returning java.util.stream.Stream
* stream() returning a specialised sub-interface of java.util.stream.Stream, called CacheStream. This interface add extra methods to j.u.s.Stream, for example {{disableRehashAware}}

The compiler incorrectly infer the type of stream() to be j.u.s.Stream and thus cannot infer {{stream().disableRehashAware()}}
