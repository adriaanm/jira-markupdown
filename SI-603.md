Both of the first two snippets in the following code should do the same thing, but the first one fails to compile:

```scala
scala> Array[Int](1)
<console>:5: error: type arguments [Int] do not conform to method apply's type parameter bounds [A <: AnyRef]
       Array[Int](1)
       ^
scala> Array(1)         
res2: Array[Int] = Array(1)
```

For comparison, this works:

```scala
scala> Array[Integer](1)
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
res1: Array[Integer] = Array(1)
```
