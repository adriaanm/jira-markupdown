Looks like an overzealous search and replace to change int->Int happened before initial commit of source:scala/trunk/src/library/scala/BigInt.scala?marks=64-65#L64 .  The Java docs (for example, http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html) show it all lowercased, which makes more sense.

Patch attached.
