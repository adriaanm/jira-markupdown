Given that scala has powerful imports, plus we can rename/alias types, it would be great if we could just use the same name/expression for types in scaladoc comments as we use in the code - rather than having to use fully qualified names in link.

e.g.
```scala
/** something [[List]] */
```

rather than
```scala
/** something [[scala.collection.immutable.List]] */
```
