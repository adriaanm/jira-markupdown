This is a real buzzkill. How does it manage, given classTag[Boolean], to a) not match the Boolean extractor and b) match the Object extractor?

There are pretty close to zero tests for this. The only one which comes close is test/files/run/virtpatmat_typetag.scala. Not cool.
{code}
scala> import scala.reflect._
import scala.reflect._

scala> def f(x: Boolean) = x match { case ClassTag.Boolean(_) => "bool" ; case _ => "other" }
f: (x: Boolean)String

scala> f(true)
res0: String = bool

scala> def f[T: ClassTag](x: T) = x match { case ClassTag.Boolean(y) => "bool" ; case ClassTag.Object(_) => classTag[T].runtimeClass }
f: [T](x: T)(implicit evidence$1: scala.reflect.ClassTag[T])java.io.Serializable

scala> f(true)
res1: java.io.Serializable = boolean
{code}

It's designed to be used like:

{code}
scala> def f[T: ClassTag](x: T) = x match { case x: Boolean => "bool" ; case _ => "other" }
f: [T](x: T)(implicit evidence$1: scala.reflect.ClassTag[T])String

scala> f(true)
res0: String = bool
{code}
It's an extractor designed to be used as a type test, but to fail as an extractor?

How is anyone ever going to figure that out? How does it even work at all? Is it completely unspecified?

from ClassTag:

{code}
  /** A ClassTag[T] can serve as an extractor that matches only objects of type T.
   *
   * The compiler tries to turn unchecked type tests in pattern matches into checked ones
   * by wrapping a `(_: T)` type pattern as `ct(_: T)`, where `ct` is the `ClassTag[T]` instance.
   * Type tests necessary before calling other extractors are treated similarly.
   * `SomeExtractor(...)` is turned into `ct(SomeExtractor(...))` if `T` in `SomeExtractor.unapply(x: T)`
   * is uncheckable, but we have an instance of `ClassTag[T]`.
   */
  def unapply(x: Any): Option[T] = unapply_impl(x)
{code}
git log -S says it was to fix SI-6318
