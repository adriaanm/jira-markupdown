The compiler crashes with a StackOverflowError during the type-checking phase.

I have attached the source file which causes the crash as well as the output messages emitted by the IDE (IntelliJ) which contains the stacktrace and the details of the error.

The offending bit appears to be the contravariance annotation on the type parameter T for the ObservableTrait. If the annotation is removed or replaced with '+' then the program just doesn't compile which I believe is the right behavior.
