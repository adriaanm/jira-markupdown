I propose the Either ADT similar to Haskell's Data.Either. I also propose adding some functions to scala.Function (id and const), which are used in the implementation of Either.

Please note that the submitted patch has been thoroughly tested using ScalaCheck, but because of some slight changes to the proposal (from the original, which uses many more libraries), I have not included these tests. They can, however, be shown or even adapted to this proposal.
There are two things that should be added to this proposal before we can add this to the Scala standard library:

  1. Code examples that show the usefulness of `Either` in Scala (I am sure there are plenty, see Haskell). Focus should be on examples that are significantly harder to implement using existing language mechanisms (e.g. pattern matching) or classes in the standard library.

  2. Test cases that can be added to the test suite. A test case consists of an executable `object` (extending `Application` or providing a `main` method) called `Test`, and a file containing the expected output.

Note that we are interested in adding an `Either` type to the library, and the proposal is well worked out. It's just that the two things I mentioned are missing, and people in LAMP currently don't have the resources to provide them.
> 3) In order to meet objective 2) am I able to provide a test case that requires running against ScalaCheck?

Preferably, the test cases do not require ScalaCheck. ScalaCheck-based tests are better than nothing, though. I can take a look and see whether we can easily integrate the tests with the standard Scala test suite.

> 4) I'd like to revise the submitted patch, since the Either that I use has evolved heavily from use in commercial project. Though, probably only minor changes from the patch, but still important. Is this OK?

Sure, just attach the new version of the patch. Sorry for the delay.
