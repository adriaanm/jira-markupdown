This bug is related to SI-2428 and tested with the snapshot version that fixes SI-2428.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Create a class or object with the name BitSet
 2. Compile the class by saving the file
 3. Delete the BitSet code from the editor and save the file to re-compile (the file now gets deleted as opposed to SI-2428)
 4. Import scala.collection.BitSet

After competing the above steps we get a warning saying *imported BitSet is permanently hidden by definition of class BitSet*.

Doing a clean and a re-build removes the warning message.
This is a bug in the resident mode. Can be reproduced using:
{code}
scalac -Xresident
nsc> src/Test.scala

Remove BitSet class, import scala.collection.BitSet
nsc> src/Test.scala
src/Test.scala:4: warning: imported `BitSet' is permanently hidden by definition of class BitSet
import scala.collection.BitSet
{code}
Fixing this ticket will also fix SI-2581. Even simpler test case is:
{code}
class A
class B(val a: A)

scalac -Xresident
nsc> src/AB.scala
Remove A
nsc> src/AB.scala
// no errors
{code}

This bug might also be the cause of SI-1584. Please see the test case in the bug report and confirm.
This bug appears to be fixed in r20397.

*Testing procedure*
 1. Create a class with the name BitSet
 2. Compile the class by saving the file
 3. Delete the BitSet class from the editor and save the file
 4. Import scala.collection.BitSet
 5. Use the BitSet in a class defined in the file

As the result of the above no bogus warning messages appears.
