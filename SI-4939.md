The following code should not compile.

scala> object Foo { val 1 = 2 }
defined module Foo

Also, as been pointed out by Seth Tisue, the defined val shadows the corresponding integer literal, producing unexpected behavior:

scala> object O { val 1 = 2; def x = 1 }
defined module O

scala> O.x
scala.MatchError: 2 (of class java.lang.Integer)
"val 1 = 2" compiling is according to spec.

```
PatVarDef ::= ‘val’ PatDef
PatDef    ::= Pattern2 ‘=’ Expr
Pattern2  ::= Literal
```

It's not so according to spec that one can redefine the literal 1.
Oh yeah, that's the object constructor throwing that exception.  In that case it's all as expected.
Indeed, val definitions that don't bind any variables are actually explicitly speced. See SLS 4.1: "If p has no bound variables..."

There is much discussion of this issue at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-user/k57U6jt8Za0 

Surely this is a bug though:
```
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.RC4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> { val 1 = 2 }
scala.MatchError: 2 (of class java.lang.Integer)

scala> val 1 = 2

scala> 
```

No error there at the end, just "OK boss!"

Shall I open a separate ticket on it? Or shall we reopen this one?
I opened #4950 on the REPL part of this.
