It would also be helpful to mention that class definitions don't need parenthesis or braces or anything, since this is the first point that is used, and it's easy for a Java programmer to lose his/her bearings without them.  To a new learner, it's not clear if the case classes are part of the {{abstract class Tree}} or not.
