Seems like this is really a corner case with `Array`.

We could either adjust this to skip pack to `superaccessors` for Array:
```scala
    /** The logic approximately boils down to finding the most recent phase
     *  which immediately follows any of parser, namer, typer, or erasure.
     *  In effect that means this will return one of:
     *
     *    - packageobjects (follows namer)
     *    - superaccessors (follows typer)
     *    - posterasure    (follows erasure)
     *    - null
     */
    private def unsafeTypeParamPhase = {
      var ph = phase
      while (ph.prev.keepsTypeParams)
        ph = ph.prev

      ph
    }
```

and/or hard-code the specialization info transformer to be a no-op for Array.
