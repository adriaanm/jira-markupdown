In the syntax summary chapter, non-terminal {{opchar}} is specified as:

{noformat}
opchar           ::= // printableChar not matched by (whiteSpace | upper | lower |
                     // letter | digit | paren | delim | opchar | Unicode_Sm | Unicode_So)
{noformat}

Note how {{opchar}} appears in that "... not matched by ..." list.  

As currently constructed, isn't that saying that {{opchar}} can produce only characters that are not characters produced by {{opchar}}?  That is, isn't that a contradiction (well, unless something else excluded all of {{printableChar}})?


Shouldn't {{opchar}} be removed from that list?


Also, are the references to Unicode character categories in the wrong place?  (It's not fully clear whether the {{opchar}} definition means to include Sm and So characters or exclude them.)
