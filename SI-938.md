Ideally, I would like the following code to compile correctly:

```scala
def foo[T,U <:Iterable[T]](u : U)(implicit f : U=>List[Iterable[T]]) =
f(u).reduceLeft(_++_)
implicit def fR(x : Range) = x :: Nil
foo(1 to 100)
```

Unfortunately, right now I get the error:

```scala
error: inferred type arguments [T,Range.Inclusive] do not
conform to method foo's type parameter bounds [T,U <: Iterable[T]]
```

Is it possible to get the compiler to figure this one out? Trying an explicit cast for Range to Iterable[Int] doesn't help.

Thanks,
David
