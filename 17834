Currently {{foldRight}} overflows on long lists. Martin Odersky recommended to use reverse.foldLeft, but no such recommendation appears in the ScalaDocs - see discussion in SI-3295. But now SI-3295 is being discussed again in this topic
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/RrmfYQpTTfc/discussion
but if nothing happens there, documentation should be fixed (I volunteer to do that, if this bug is accepted).
