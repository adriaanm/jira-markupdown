Good day.
Whe I try to use scalac ant task, I receive message: 
BUILD FAILED
/home/rssh/eclipse-workspace/xmldb/build.xml:47: The <scalac> type doesn't support the "debug" attribute.

scalac called as next:
 
  <scalac srcdir="src" destdir="bin"  debug="${debug}" >  
  </scalac>
  
(build.xml is attached, but it can be quite generic)

Note, that debug attribute of scalac task is mention in documentation:
http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/ant/index.html
use the *addparams* attribute instead. Documentation on *scalac* Ant task has been updated accordingly.
