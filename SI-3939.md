2.8.0 liked the code fine.

{code}
  ~/newbug> cat J.java 
package p1;
public abstract class J {
	protected abstract void foo();
}
  ~/newbug> cat S.scala 
package p2

class S extends p1.J {
  override def foo() { }
}
  ~/newbug> /usr/local/scala-2.8.0.final/bin/scalac J.java S.scala
  ~/newbug> rm -r p2
  ~/newbug> /usr/local/scala-2.8.1.RC3/bin/scalac J.java S.scala  
S.scala:4: error: method foo overrides nothing
  override def foo() { }
               ^
one error found
{code}

perhaps SI-3934 is related (thanks ijuma for pointing this out)
I'm clearly a menace to anything protected so I'll be staying far away, but I think this is the bug in Refechecks:
{code}
  -              !(inclazz.isJavaDefined && sym.privateWithin == sym.enclosingPackageClass) || memberEnclPackageCls == sym.privateWithin
  +              !(inclazz.isJavaDefined && sym.isPrivate && sym.privateWithin == sym.enclosingPackageClass) || memberEnclPackageCls == sym.privateWithin
{code}
Checking sym.privateWithin without also checking sym.isPrivate excludes protected[X] as well, and protected[p1] is how java's protected is translated here.
(In r23355) A modifier's work is never done.  Another mortal embrace with
protected and its bevy of corner cases.  Closes SI-3939, SI-3947.
This patch is intended for both trunk and 2.8.1.  Already reviewed
and co-authored by moors, and review by oderksy.
