(In r23180) Pattern matching on Array types, working for reals.

  def f[T](a: Array[T]) = a match {
    case x: Array[Int]      => x(0)
    case x: Array[Double]   => 2
    // etc.
  }

I'd also like to thank "instantiateTypeVar" for displacing the
mechanical spiders and giant squid beings which used to fill my
nightmares.  Now that I know true horror, I welcome the squid.

Closes scala/bug#2755, review by odersky.
