I'm running OS X 10.9, and I have Scala 2.10.3 installed via brew. I launched the REPL by running scala, and after a while received an unusual warning, and bash became unresponsive. I closed the terminal, restarted it, and did ps aux | grep scala. I noticed a large number of scala processes running, and they continued to increase, even after exiting the REPL.

I'm running Java 7 update 45.
I was able to instantly reproduce the issue by launching scala via drip (I too am on OSX 10.9) but I use scala all day every day and I've never seen it under any other conditions. So I think it is more likely that you still had some kind of residual drip issue. It could still be a scala bug which is only triggered by drip though.
