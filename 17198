I executed push-binary-libs.sh under cygwin the script reported the error 
{code}
./tools/binary-repo-lib.sh: line 78: shasum: command not found
{code}
and as a consequence all generated sha1 files were empty.

In my Cygwin installation {{shasum}} is not defined, but {{sha1sum}} would be available.


I have seen that the script {{tools/binary-repo-lib.sh}} makes at some places a distinction between {{sha1sum}} and {{shasum}} (e.g. in method {{getJarSha}}), but not in {{pushJarFile}}.

Locally I replaced {{shasum -p}} by {{sha1sum}} and this worked for me.
