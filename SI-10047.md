Consider this minimal example:

{code:scala}
import scala.language.reflectiveCalls

class A

trait MyTrait {
  def obj: A
}

object Main extends MyTrait {
  lazy val obj = new A {
    def x = 42
  }

  println(obj.x)
}
{code}

While this compiles correctly in Scala 2.11.8, I'm getting the following error in Scala 2.12.0:

{noformat}
[error] /scala-test/test.scala:14: value x is not a member of A
[error]   println(obj.x)
{noformat}

I read the breaking changes in Scala 2.12 release notes and I couldn't find anything related to this. I tried adding more fields and methods to {{MyTrait}} to be sure SAM conversions wouldn't apply, but the error persists.

Is this an intended breaking change or a bug? Is there an workaround?
"Concretely, when computing the type of an overriding field, the type of the overridden field is used as the expected type. As a result, the inferred type of a val or lazy val may change in Scala 2.12." http://scala-lang.org/news/2.12.0

In your example, the type of the lazy val is simply A. If you want the structural type, you can explicitly declare it:

{code:scala}
lazy val obj: A { def x: Int } = ...
{code}
