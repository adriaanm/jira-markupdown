It's description says: "The smallest difference between two values of Double." However, if you look up its value it's set to java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE.

The _smallest difference_ between two Doubles is a lot bigger then the _smallest value_ that can be stored in a Double.

Here's an exempt from "float.h":

#define DBL_EPSILON     2.2204460492503131e-016 /* smallest such that 1.0+DBL_EPSILON != 1.0 */

#define DBL_MIN         2.2250738585072014e-308 /* min positive value */
{code}
scala> scala.Double.MinValue == -java.lang.Double.MAX_VALUE
res0: Boolean = true

scala> scala.Double.Epsilon == java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE 
res1: Boolean = true
{code}

where did you find the description "The smallest difference between two values of Double." However, if you look up its value it's set to java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE"?
The description is on the doc comment of [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_8_0_final/src/library/scala/Math.scala#L76 scala.Math.EPS_DOUBLE], which is deprecated with a pointer to `Double.Epsilon`. `Double.Epsilon` itself is not part of the API documentation.

This is the accepted meaning of epsilon. Apache Commons Math defines it as:

{code}
class MathUtils {
/** Smallest positive number such that 1 - EPSILON is not numerically equal to 1. */
    public static final double EPSILON = 0x1.0p-53;
{code}

Usage:

{code}
scala> import org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils
import org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils

scala> (1d - Double.Epsilon) == 1d
res18: Boolean = true

scala> (1d - MathUtils.EPSILON) == 1d
res19: Boolean = false

scala> (1d - MathUtils.EPSILON / 2) == 1d
res20: Boolean = true

scala>  MathUtils.EPSILON
res21: Double = 1.1102230246251565E-16
{code}

I guess the deviation from the names used in Java stemmed from the confusing name `MIN_VALUE`, which could be interpreted as `-MAX_VALUE` or the smallest positive value. But epsilon is the wrong name for this value.

Proposal:

 * Change `Double.Epsilon` to the value defined by Apache Commons Math, with a migration warning.
 * Add `Double.MinPositiveValue` = `java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE`
 * Add `Double.MinNegativeValue` = `-Double.MaxValue`
 * Deprecate `Double.MinValue`, rather than leave it a different meaning from `java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE`, with which Java developers may be familiar.
 * Do the same for the other `AnyVal` companion objects.
 * Remove the already deprecated constants from `scala.Math`.


Thanks Jason for elaborating on this!

I am wondering why the c++ libraries define Epsilon as 2.2e-016 and Apache Commons Math uses 1.1e-16. Apparently the difference is in the definition, e.g.:

{code}
scala> import org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils
import org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils

scala> (1d - MathUtils.EPSILON) == 1d
res4: Boolean = false

scala> (1d - MathUtils.EPSILON/2) == 1d
res5: Boolean = true

scala> (1d + MathUtils.EPSILON) == 1d
res6: Boolean = true

scala> (1d + 2*MathUtils.EPSILON) == 1d
res7: Boolean = false
{code}

Apache Commons Math: 1 - EPSILON != 1
C++ headers: 1 + EPSILON != 1

(In r22957) close SI-3791 according to jason's proposal. Epsilon is just deprecated for now; for changing it, it needs to go through the
long cycle (deprecate, remove, add with new behavior). I tried adding Scaladoc for these members but failed for now, see
my message in internals.
`addModuleMethod(FloatClass, "MinPositiveValue", -java.lang.Float.MAX_VALUE) `

should be

`addModuleMethod(FloatClass, "MinPositiveValue", java.lang.Float.MIN_VALUE)`


(In r22959) fix fix for (close SI-3791) and made deprecation for constants work. no review.
(In r24461) Addresses the issues swirling around Double.Epsilon and friends
which were battled out in more than one venue and then aptly summarized
by retronym in SI-3791.  Thanks to Simon Ochsenreither for submitting
a patch; I wasn't able to use too much of it because the source
code for these types is generated, but effort is always
appreciated.  Closes SI-3791, and I'm tired and I'd hate to blow
this one at this late date: review by rytz.
Will add the constant {{Epsilon}} to the classes {{Double}} and {{Float}} as follows:
{code}
scala> final val Eps = java.lang.Double.longBitsToDouble(0x3ca0000000000000L)
Eps: Double = 1.1102230246251565E-16

scala> 1d+Eps == 1d
res1: Boolean = true

scala> 1d-Eps == 1d
res2: Boolean = false

scala> final val Eps = java.lang.Float.intBitsToFloat(0x33800000)
Eps: Float = 5.9604645E-8

scala> 1f+Eps == 1f
res3: Boolean = true

scala> 1f-Eps == 1f
res4: Boolean = false
{code}

This value gives an upper bound on the relative error due to rounding real numbers to floating point numbers (either Floats or Doubles). For any floating point system with base B and precision (or mantissa length) p this upper bound is defined as B^(-(p-1))/2 (which corresponds to 1/2 ulp = 1/2 unit in the last place).

  - Float (B=2 / p=24): Eps = 2^(-24)

  - Double (B=2 / p=53): Eps = 2^(-53)

The definition as the smallest value with {{1+Eps != 1}} or {{1-Eps != 1}} leads to slightly different values (if not only powers of 2 are considered). The following method computes the smallest value for {{1+Eps != 1}} for double precision, and you see, the result is the double number which is the neighbor of the above defined value for {{Epsilon}}.
{code}
scala> def epsilon = {
     |   def eps(a: Double, b: Double): Double = {
     |     val e = a + (b-a)/2
     |     if(a < e && e < b) {
     |       val f = 1 + e
     |       if(f == 1.0) eps(e, b) else eps(a, e)
     |     } else b
     |   }
     |   eps(0, 1)
     | }
epsilon: Double

scala> val eps = epsilon
eps: Double = 1.1102230246251568E-16

scala> 1d+eps==1d
res1: Boolean = false

scala> f"${java.lang.Double.doubleToLongBits(eps)}%x"
res2: String = 3ca0000000000001
{code}

"The smallest difference between two values of Double." is java.double.Double.Min
{code}
scala> val a = java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE
a: Double = 4.9E-324

scala> val b = 2*java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE
b: Double = 1.0E-323

scala> a-b
res0: Double = -4.9E-324
{code}

And as the pull request on github tells defining a machine epsilon is really opinionated and most programmers would just make their own. Should this issue be closed?
My proposal is to close this bug report. The bug originally reported has been fixed. It was not clear to me whether I can simply press the `close issue` button or whether some discussions have to be made somewhere.

Regarding the definition: Is it really defined in IEEE754? I just skimmed the spec, but did not find info about the machine epsilon, and on [Wikipedia|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon] I found the sentence
{quote}
The IEEE standard does not define the terms machine epsilon and unit roundoff, so differing definitions of these terms are in use, which can cause some confusion.
{quote}


I remember two definitions:

* the eps is defined to be the smallest float with the property 1+eps > 1. This definition leads to 5.960465E-8 (for float), or {{1 100111 00000000000000000000001}} in binary (or 2^(-24)*(1+2^(-23)))

* the eps is defined to bhe the largest float with the property 1+eps = 1. This definition leads to 5.960465E-8 as well, or {{1 100111 00000000000000000000000}} in binary (or 2^(-24)


So I really come to the conclusion that the Scala library should not define such a constant.
"Fixed" by removal (in a previous version).  As [~dgruntz] points out, there is not complete consensus about which of the two obvious values for epsilon should be used.  We now have none, which leaves it up to the user to pick.
