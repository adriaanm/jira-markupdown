When scala.swing.Dialog.show(anything) is called as the very first thing in application like this:
```scala
import scala.swing.Dialog
object Main extends App{
  Dialog.showMessage(message = "something")
}
```

without defined title, it creates window as expected, but that window is empty, has only one "OK" button at standard place and has proper default title. Nothing on this window is clickable (cross in corner nor ok button). Everything works as it should if title is specified or when something from java's swing library is mentioned in code before this Dialog call. (I used `JFrame.isDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated` successfully.)

(Sorry, I wanted to set priority to minor, but when I click that, nothing happens)

EDIT: Forgot to add that it works properly in scala console.
