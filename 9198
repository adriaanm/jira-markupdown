@paolo  `protected[this]` is an important ingredient of the unsoundness scenario because it lets us write functions like `f` which have contravaraint occurrences of covariant parameters. Without it, I cannot come up with a crash scenario. 

Indeed covariant aliases have the same problems as parameters when combined with protected[this]. It would be nice if we could get rid of them. And the "split encoding" idea of treating some superclass bindings as aliases and others as approximations looks the most promising so far to me.
