[Jenkins|http://jenkins-ci.org/] also adopts this convention where class names and package names collide (except the colliding packages do not have any class files --- they only have resource files.) So I'd like to point out that this isn't just about obfuscators.

In my situation, the fix would be easier. We just want scala compiler to only consider real packages that contain some classes.
