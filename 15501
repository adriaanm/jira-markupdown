It would appear that loading a PagedSeq with the fromSource function strips out newline characters where it didn't in Scala 2.7.7.  This REPL sessions was completed with Scala 2.8.0.RC7.
{code}
scala> val ps = scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq.fromSource(scala.io.Source.fromFile("./RMDB.csv"))
ps: scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq[Char] = PagedSeq(I, N, S, N,...
scala> ps.filter(x => x == '\n').size                                                                 
res4: Int = 0
{code}
By changing this to use the fromFile function instead, all works as expected again.
{code}
scala> val ps = scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq.fromFile("./RMDB.csv")                            
ps: scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq[Char] = PagedSeq(I, N, S, N,...
scala> ps.filter(x => x == '\n').size                                                                 
res6: Int = 283
{code}
This does not appear to be caused by the Source object itself, as I can still get a count of newline characters as I would expect directly from it.
{code}
scala> val src = scala.io.Source.fromFile("./RMDB.csv")
src: scala.io.BufferedSource = non-empty iterator
scala> src.filter(x => x == '\n').size                 
res10: Int = 283
{code}
This issue was identified when trying to parse a streaming file upload in a web application.
