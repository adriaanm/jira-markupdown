This looks like it was intended as a feature, and is in the documentation (unfortunately the docs for addString, not mkString.) It's not obvious to me which way is better, but you can force lazy and you can't lazify forced.
{code}
  /** Write all defined elements of this iterable into given string builder.
   *  The written text begins with the string <code>start</code> and is finished by the string
   *  <code>end</code>. Inside, the string representations of defined elements (w.r.t.
   *  the method <code>toString()</code>) are separated by the string
   *  <code>sep</code>. The method will not force evaluation of undefined elements. A
   *  tail of such elements will be represented by a "?" instead.
