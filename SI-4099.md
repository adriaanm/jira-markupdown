=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
I've got a pair of scala scripts one that calls the other like this
minimized example:

script: a
----
{code}
#!/bin/bash -v

(cd other; b)
exec scala -cp commons-email-1.2.jar "$$0" "$$@"
!#
import org.apache.commons.mail._;
{code} 

script: other/b
----
{code}
#!/bin/bash -v

exec scala -cp commons-io-1.4.jar "$$0" "$$@"
!#
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils._;
{code}

This assumes that a is in some path like: /tmp and b is in /tmp/other and commons-email-1.2.jar and commons-io-1.4.jar are in those same paths respectively.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

{code}
$$ a
#!/bin/bash -v
(cd other; b)
#!/bin/bash -v
exec scala -cp commons-io-1.4.jar "$$0" "$$@"
exec scala -cp commons-email-1.2.jar "$$0" "$$@"
$$
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===

{code}
$$ a
#!/bin/bash -v
(cd other; b)
#!/bin/bash -v
exec scala -cp commons-io-1.4.jar "$$0" "$$@"
exec scala -cp commons-email-1.2.jar "$$0" "$$@"
/tmp/./a:7: error: value apache is not a member of package org
import org.apache.commons.mail._;
          ^
one error found
$$
{code}

=== Additional information ===

If I run with -verbose, it shows that the classpath is correct for 'b'
but not for 'a' when the exec is performed.  In both cases, scala
starts a new compile server instance (reason = "settings not equal").
When I change the exec line in 'a' by adding '-nocompdaemon' the error
goes away.

See below for discussion:

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04-307-10M3261)
  - Operating system:  MacOS 10.6

This sounds like a re-run of SI-1683.  fsc is fragile and we have pretty much zero tests for either scripts or fsc directly.  I am not up for working on either of those things until we have some real testing infrastructure which can backstop the work.
