This was discovered in Finagle when compiled with Scala 2.12 (see https://github.com/twitter/finagle/issues/581). Turns out some of the threads in the Netty worker pool dead-lock during the initialization with Scala 2.12.1 but work fine with 2.11.7.

I tried to simplify the reproducer as much as possible but I want to apologize for its size. It won't probably fit the Jira ticket so I created a self-contained Github repo (see https://github.com/vkostyukov/scala-2-12-1-and-runnable-bug) containing the reproducer.

Here are steps to reproduce the issue:

1) `git clone git@github.com:vkostyukov/scala-2-12-1-and-runnable-bug.git`
2) `cd scala-2-12-1-and-runnable-bug`
3) `sbt ++2.11.7 run` (program terminates)
4) `sbt ++2.12.1 run` (program never terminates)

I'm happy to provide more details if needed. My current hand-waving hypothesis is that it's somewhat a combination of (a) weirdly nested runnables used (b) during the class initialization.
I can't resist such a nicely detailed ticket with proper use of `its` and `it's`. Pinch me if I'm dreaming.

It works if `foo.Pool` is lazy. I wonder if all value members of package objects should be implicitly lazy.
In general, it's desirable to avoid starting threads from static initializers (such as an object constructor) because of the risk of deadlock during class loading.

The risk increases in 2.12 with lambdas. Besides making `Pool` a lazy val, the following change also unblocks, but it's really no way to live:
