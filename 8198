I think this is related:
```scala
implicit case class Foo(val foo: Int)
Foo(1)
```

This fails:
```scala
<console>:10: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method Foo of type (foo: Int)Foo
and  object Foo of type Foo.type
match argument types (Int)
              Foo(1)
              ^
```

This is because the implicit class is desugared to an implicit method with the same name as the class, which makes the code ambiguous from the compiler POV.
In my opinion it would make sense to desugar the implicit class to a different method name, like `FooImplicit`.
