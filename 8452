Jason: actually it turned out that the example you give in this ticket has not been broken by
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2a2d9235

but by

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/df9f470f

The reason is that we no longer delegate to `filter` (which Stream overrides) but we provide our own implementation based on `foreach`.

I believe that changes to `LinearSeqOptimized` are irrelevant for other (non-lazy collections) in a sense that they do not change semantics. Do you agree?

I don't understand why Stream mixes-in `LinearSeqOptimized` in the first place but this seems to be (also) irrelevant. In order to fix this bug we need to override `filterNot` in Stream the same way as `filter` is overriden of revert change to `TraversableLike`. I think the later is way to go.

WDYT?
