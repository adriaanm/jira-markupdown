I tried my example with the latest nightly snapshot but failed since the annotations didn't compile at all - has something changed with the syntax?

Anyway, I tried to narrow the problem down and it appears to be a corner-case with companion objects again. It compiles fine with 2.7.5, too, as long as the companion object doesn't implement/extend anything!

I'll attache a maven test case. To see for the 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT just replace the Scala-version in the pom.xml.
