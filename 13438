I think scala standard library should also contain reverse collection wrappers, i. e. wrappers of scala collections that implement java collection interfaces.

{code}
abstract class SeqWrapper[T] extends java.util.ArrayList[T] {
    def underlying: Seq[T]
    override def get(i: Int) = underlying(i)
    override def size = underlying.length
}
{code}

To avoid name conflicts (for example, there will be two !MapWrapper), such collections should be placed into separate package, for example collection.lcj (as opposite to jcl).

Such reverse wrappers are needed to easier call Java APIs that accept collections, and to make Java APIs to Scala libraries.

I'd like to implement package if this FR is accepted.
