"sbt 0.7.7 isn't working with 2.9.1.RC1 probably because 25068 is missing" - Johannes Rudolph

```

"compiler-interface needs to retain binary  compatibility... Fixing the error shown above is easy, but the question of what needs to retain compatibility and the verification that it is indeed compatible  is more uncertain.)" - Paul Phillips
