= problem =

EclipseFile extends AbstractFile, for currently edited files, implementation of input : InputStream and sizeOption : Option[Int] create a Array[Byte]. But main use of input and sizeOption is inside toByteArray.

And there is at least 2 issues :
* between call of input and sizeOption, content can change => incoherence
* over CPU and Memory usage (may be 2 useless Array creation + parsing/encoding)

= analysis =

= enhancement recommendation =

remove "final" modifier and allow AbstractFile implementation to provide 'immutable' arrays. 
(In r23943) Unfinalized a couple unnecessarily final methods.  Closes SI-4136, no review.
