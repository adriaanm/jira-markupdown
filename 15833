= problem =
`<:<` and `=:=` can't be composed

= analysis =

Workaround is to cast:

{code}
  implicit val `<:<_Category` : Category[<:<] = new Category[<:<] {
    def compose[X, Y, Z](f: <:<[Y, Z], g: <:<[X, Y]) = f.asInstanceOf[X <:< Z]

    def id[A] = implicitly[A <:< A]
  }

  implicit val `=:=_Category` : Category[=:=] = new Category[=:=] {
    def compose[X, Y, Z](f: =:=[Y, Z], g: =:=[X, Y]) = f.asInstanceOf[X =:= Z]

    def id[A] = implicitly[A =:= A]
  }
{code}

= enhancement recommendation =

Add a compose method to each of these classes.
