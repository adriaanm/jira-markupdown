Anyway, this is really counterintuitive and effectively means that by-name parameters make no sense with right-associative operators. I think it would be nice if the compiler at least issued a warning about this.

SLS 4.6.1 says that call-by-name argument "is not evaluated at the point of function application, but instead is evaluated at each use within the function".

So as for me, current behavior is clearly against the spec.

But 6.12.3 offers:

"If op is right- associative, the same operation is interpreted as { val x=e1; e2.op(x ) }, where x is a fresh name."
