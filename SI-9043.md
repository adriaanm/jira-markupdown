Inserting a single element into an array buffer is very slow. It calls insertAll, which then converts the result to a list and calls copyToArray on it. But it seems that copyToArray is not overridden for List, so this creates an iterator. All in all, an awful lot of ceremony for a simple insert. 

The situation is even worse when using insertAll to insert an array to an array buffer. The array is converted to a list, which creates lots of temporary objects. 

Now I am aware that a certain amount of temporary object creation can not be avoided given the design of the scala collections library, and in general I am willing to pay the price for the flexibility. 

But when working with ArrayBuffers and Arrays the amount of overhead should be minimised.

Here is a benchmark for insert and insertAll: https://gist.github.com/rklaehn/3e9290118fcf63d1feae

As you can see, the insertAll is 10 times slower than the equivalent method on java.util.ArrayList, and the insert method is 5 times slower (it is actually even worse than that, since the benchmark has to remove the element again).
Nope, can't close it.  I think @rklaehn will have to close it.
