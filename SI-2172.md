The compiler doesn't allow annotations on parameters with case classes:

case class User( @javax.persistence.Column{ val name="uid" } val username: String )

This gives a compiler error 'error: not found: type javax.persistence.Column'

Leaving out the 'case' and the compiler doesn't complain any more.
I tried my example with the latest nightly snapshot but failed since the annotations didn't compile at all - has something changed with the syntax?

Anyway, I tried to narrow the problem down and it appears to be a corner-case with companion objects again. It compiles fine with 2.7.5, too, as long as the companion object doesn't implement/extend anything!

I'll attache a maven test case. To see for the 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT just replace the Scala-version in the pom.xml.

yes, you need to use the named arguments syntax now:

{code}
case class User( @javax.persistence.Column(name = "uid") val username: String ) 
{code}
Ok, I checked with 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT and the new named-argument syntax. The problem exists there, too:

{{ /Users/kriesten/tmp/test/src/main/scala/test/test.scala:13: error: not found: type Column }}

But it might actually not be a problem with annotations but with the companion object.
The problem is the {{import}} clasue. The following fails with the same error:

{code}
object User
import javax.persistence._
case class User( @Column(name="uid") val username: String )
{code}

if you move the {{import}} above the {{object}} it compiles fine.
more precisely, the annotation gets copied from the primary constructor of {{class User}} to the factory method in {{object User}}, the result looks like the following (and obviously doesn't compile):

{code}
object User {
  def apply(@Column(name="uid") username: String) = { ... }
}
import javax.persistence._
class User {
  @Column(name="uid") val username: String
  def this(@Column(name="uid") username: String) { ... }
}
{code}
