As per this thread:

The use of Application is a veritable minefield of things that can go wrong, between performance issued mentioned here, concurrency issues mentioned previously (ticket #746 ), etc. Writing significant amounts of work inside the constructor (particularly that of a top level object) is just not a good idea, and Application encourages that, leading to people running into these issues unexpectedly and getting very confused.

Given this, the consensus in the linked thread seems to be that Application would really be better off depreciated. 

If the verdict is not to depreciate it, I'll submit a patch with improved "Here be dragons" documentation for it.
