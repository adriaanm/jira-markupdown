3 files attached (possibly 2 - mytext_repro_empty.txt is an empty file which something doesn't seem to like). Code below, modify XXX to pick files.

val source = scala.io.Source.fromFile(raw"C:\testfiles\myText_XXXX.txt")
val f = source.toSeq

using file  mytext_repro_empty.txt  I get 

f: Seq[Char] = Stream()

which seems right. Using  mytext_repro4.txt  I get 

f: Seq[Char] = Stream(-, ?)

which is well formed, I suppose, but don't know what the dash and question mark indicate.  Using  mytext_repro5.txt  I get

, ?)eq[Char] = Stream(

which is evidently broken.
