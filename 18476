To reproduce:
 - Open a REPL
 - Type {{"99.4".toDou<TAB>}}

Exception etc attached.

You can occasionally get less violent versions of this that seem to be related to scala/bug#6659, see the second half of that attachment.

I'm incredibly new to Scala (~15 minutes) so I'm not sure what's going on here, but the result of hitting tab seems to vary wildly between "unclosed string literal" and varying levels of stack traces.
