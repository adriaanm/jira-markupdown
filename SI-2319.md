running the mailbox-example from http://programming-scala.labs.oreilly.com/ch09.html behaves different typed in in REPL and run in eclipse (3.5) or from an script (scala.bat script.scala).

both eclipse-plugin and scala updated today (2nd sept 2009) from nightly builds -> scala-version 2.8.x.
used java version 1.6.0_13


the output should be (and is typed in in REPL):
I've got 3 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 3 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 4 messages in my mailbox.

but run from eclipse or as script (parameter to scala.bat) the output is:
I've got 6 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 5 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 4 messages in my mailbox.


the scala-code in question:

{code}
// code-examples/Concurrency/actor-mailbox-script.scala

import scala.actors.Actor
import scala.actors.Actor._

val countActor = actor {
  loop {
    react {
      case "how many?" => {
        println("I've got " + mailboxSize.toString + " messages in my mailbox.")
      }
    }
  }
}

countActor ! 1
countActor ! 2
countActor ! 3
countActor ! "how many?"
countActor ! "how many?"
countActor ! 4
countActor ! "how many?
{code}


maybe related to that problem:

  the factorial-examples on the oreilly-site also don't work in eclipse


Okay, I didn't fix this or anything but I just checked in a rewrite of MessageQueue which adds tracing.  The actor library is too complicated for me to figure out much about it without a serious time investment, but for whatever reason a bunch of different message queues are created depending on how you run it.  The one doing the wrong thing puts its first three messages in three different queues (labelled below as Temp:3, Reactor:1, and Temp:4) and then piles them up in Temp:4.
{code}
[Temp:3 size=1] [APPEND 1] first = null, last = null
[Reactor:1 size=1] [APPEND 1] first = null, last = null
[Temp:4 size=1] [APPEND 2] first = null, last = null
[Temp:4 size=2] [APPEND 3] first = 2, last = 2
[Temp:4 size=3] [APPEND how many?] first = 2, last = 3
[Temp:4 size=4] [APPEND how many?] first = 2, last = how many?
[Temp:4 size=5] [APPEND 4] first = 2, last = how many?
[Temp:4 size=6] [APPEND how many?] first = 2, last = 4
[Temp:4 size=6] [REMOVE how many?] first = 2, last = how many?
[Reactor:1 size=2] [APPEND 2] first = 1, last = 1
[Reactor:1 size=3] [APPEND 3] first = 1, last = 2
[Reactor:1 size=4] [APPEND how many?] first = 1, last = 3
[Reactor:1 size=5] [APPEND 4] first = 1, last = how many?
[Reactor:1 size=6] [APPEND how many?] first = 1, last = 4
I've got 6 messages in my mailbox.
[Reactor:1 size=6] [REMOVE how many?] first = 1, last = how many?
I've got 5 messages in my mailbox.
[Reactor:1 size=5] [REMOVE how many?] first = 1, last = 4
I've got 4 messages in my mailbox.
{code}
In the REPL there are no "Temp" queues created, but "Start" queues instead.  (The label comes from where in the actor lib the queue is instantiated.) Partial transcript below:
{code}
[Start:3 size=1] [APPEND 1] first = null, last = null
[Reactor:1 size=1] [APPEND 1] first = null, last = null
[Start:4 size=1] [APPEND 2] first = null, last = null
[Reactor:1 size=2] [APPEND 2] first = 1, last = 1
[Start:5 size=1] [APPEND 3] first = null, last = null
[Reactor:1 size=3] [APPEND 3] first = 1, last = 2
[Start:6 size=1] [APPEND how many?] first = null, last = null
[Start:6 size=1] [REMOVE how many?] first = null, last = null
I've got 3 messages in my mailbox.
[Start:7 size=1] [APPEND how many?] first = null, last = null
[Start:7 size=1] [REMOVE how many?] first = null, last = null
I've got 3 messages in my mailbox.
{code}
If you send the `"how many?"` messages synchronously (`countActor !? "how many?"`), i.e., waiting for a reply after each of those, then you get the 334 output also outside the REPL. Arguably, this behavior is correct in the context of asynchronous messaging: only when waiting for a reaction before continuing to send further messages can you tell how many messages the receiver sees in its mailbox.

The important point (*) is this: if all messages are sent asynchronously, the sender is never able to tell at which point the receiver decides to process the messages in its mailbox. Depending on the time when the receiver processes its messages, it sees a different number of them.

This is where the different observed behavior comes from: in trunk (2.8) the receiver may not immediately check whether it can process an incoming message, since that checking task is submitted to a thread pool, and may thus run after the sender has sent additional messages. The main reason for this change is that it allows to shield the sender from any exceptions being thrown while doing the matching in the receiver. This change was introduced based on feedback from the use of actors in lift. Doing the message matching on the sender's thread could lead to exceptions propagating from the receiver to the sender in unexpected ways. What's more, it could lead to deadlocks if there are locks acquired during the matching (e.g., using pattern guards). Note that the order in which messages sent from the same actor are processed is unaffected by this change. This means the receiver continues to process the messages in the same order they were sent.

Another important point is that even in the implementation of 2.7.x, a third actor that sends messages to the same receiver could cause the receiver to see a non-deterministic number of messages in the mailbox, since the two senders run asynchronously.

Because of the point (*) I mentioned above, a sender should never depend on the number of asynchronous messages that have arrived in the receiver's mailbox before the receiver processes a message. If the sender wants to be sure the receiver did not receive another asynchronous message from the sender, it should wait for a reply.

Therefore, I think that the above example exposes an implementation detail that a client should not depend upon. Asynchronous messaging simply __is fundamentally different__ from synchronous messaging. If you want a synchronous reaction, use a synchronous send.
