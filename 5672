As this ticket stands, this is not reproducible. It requiers a now-dated version of ScalaTest source. I dug around for a bit in ScalaTest source and Scaladoc, and it seems that `JMockSugar` doesn't exist any longer, so I can't get a full idea of what's really happening at this point.

In general, self-contained and minimized code examples are what we need to issue a fix.

Can you please submit a self-contained (i.e. not dependent on ScalaTest source) example?
