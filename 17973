Consider this code:

{code}scala> Function.tupled((n:Int) => (m:Int) => n + m){code}

I think the following error could be a bit less excessive:
```scala

This seems to be a regression in 2.10/2.11, because in 2.9.2 I get this:
```scala
<console>:8: error: overloaded method value tupled with alternatives:
  [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, b](f: (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) => b)((a1, a2, a3, a4, a5)) => b <and>
