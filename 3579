I see, so it is allowed to override an empty-paren with a val. That is indeed a great feature, not only in respect with interoperability with non-scala code. It also allows a (Scala) method with declared side-effects (empty-paren) to be overridden by a member without side-effects.

I'm almost sure this feature violates type-safety though if nothing is changed to the compiler. Now that I'm better informed, I posted a new ticket with a better definition of the problem. (SI-3144)

Something not compiling does not represent unsoundness, I fully agree. 
The point is, given that this form of overriding is part of Scala, and Scala claims to be a type-safe language, that I think this *should* compile.
