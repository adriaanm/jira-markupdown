Compiling and running this program  will result in the issue that it overflows the stack at runtime in 2.10 but not in 2.9. Please fix this - it's a critical bug.
```scala
object ListSer extends App {

  val largeList = (1 to 1000000).toList

  val oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("C:/tmp/largeList.ser"))
  oos.writeObject(largeList)
  oos.flush()
  oos.close()

  val ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("C:/tmp/largeList.ser"))
  val read = ois.readObject().asInstanceOf[List[Int]]
  println(read.size)


}
```

Here is the stack trace:

Hi, I've forked/updated the gist:

https://gist.github.com/4517945

There was couple of bugs in the first version, as you might have noticed.

This version removes the thread-local data (set's to null) after top-level call, so no trace is left. I think it's better so. But if you think it is better to keep the data there to avoid per-top-list-allocation, then it should not be an instance of a scala class (ListSerializationCtrl), but an Array[Boolean] instance, so the hypothetical class-loader leak is prevented.

The version sets inLoop = false directly after write/read in finally block, so that when an exception is thrown the data is in correct state. I first thought it is enough to just remove (set to null) the TLS data in the top-level try/finally, but this way is safer; it's possible to imagine serialization-data which could leave the TLS data in wrong state (if one does e.g serialization within serialization). This is paranoid, but I measured the cost of try/finally there (against setting inLoop = false not within finally) and it was not recognizeable, so no reason to not have that.

It also supports the 2.9 serialization format data, at least according my testing. I wrote the object using oldWriteObject() and read correctly using the new readObject().

I've moved the ListSerializationCtrl class and thread-local variable out of List object. This is mainly to have it private and not private[scala] because the List.tlSerCtrl would be visible from Java in IDEs. So now ListSerializationStart/End/Ctrl are all private classes close to each other.

Finally I did some performance testing. List of size S, serialized/deserialized N times into/from a byte-array:

List size | repeated | 2.9.(ms) | this code(ms) | current 2.10.(ms)
  10      |   2000x  |  33      |   46          |  50
  20      |   2000x  |  40      |   62          |  70
  500     |   200x   |  44      |   86          |  105

So this code is actually faster then the current 2.10. code. That was a pleasant surprise. I don't have definitive explanation on that. I think the code is ready, but I didn't yet have time to learn how to do pull request, or what is the next step.
Jan, thank you for your patch!
It seems to me that you have correctly addressed the issues from #5374, in particular
that the structural sharing is maintained when serializing objects which point to the same lists multiple times.
Also, it seems to me that the loop-logic works correctly now.

A couple of comments:

1) I did not completely understand why the fields {{seen0}} and {{inLoop0}} private, why not have just public {{var}}s.

2) It seems to me that the idea is that when the `seen` field becomes `false`, serializing a `::` has to bring it
back to `true`. Otherwise, the tail must have been `Nil`, meaning that the loop in `writeObjectImpl` can end.

3) It seems to me that serializing nested lists should work as well.
Calling `writeAsSeen` in line 34 may serialize a nested list, in which case the nested list should leave the `ctrl`
object in the `seen == false` state, but in that case the `writeAsSeen` of the outer list brings it back to `true`.

Am I right?

Nevertheless, could you add a few more tests with nested lists, and lists of objects having nested lists and shared lists to ensure that this works?

4) I suppose a similar inverse logic applies to {{{readObject}}}, from what I can see.

Overall, looks good.

On a side note, I wonder if there is some existing serialization infrastructure, i.e. a method call, we could use instead
of the thread local with state patch to output the objects into the object output stream and maintain structural sharing.
Something like `out.writeObjectId(...)` could greatly simplify the code we have in the patch now.

Hi Aleksandar,

ad 1) It was so in the first (or maybe also second) version in the fork. I refactored those code pieces from write/readObjectImpl into those ListSerializationCtrl.write/read/InLoop/AsSeen methods to make the code in write/readObjectImpl shorter and more readable and I hoped giving those pieces names would also make it more understandable (than mutate the vars in the write/readObjectImpl directly). When that happened, having the vars private makes clear that only the methods of LSCtrl can mutate them. Doing that I hoped that the analogy of read vs. write is apparent because both write/readObjectImpl and those write/readInLoop, write/readAsSeen are simple enough to see the mirroring. The goal is readability. If you find the "inlined" version more readable, I've absolutely nothing against it.

ad 2,3) Yes. The idea is that the list is serialized in the loop, and each sub-list contributes just its head and itself, so to say. So technically the serialization stream consists of multiple of single-head unconnected lists (well they don't have tail in the stream so they are not lists). The loop makes sure all of them are in, and during the deserialization the loop connects them again.

This is controlled by the inLoop variable. When the writeObjectImpl sees inLoop = true, it knows someone else manages the loop and that it must serialize its head only, and that it has to set the seen to true, to tell that someone it did so. So the seen is like a response, that the list (not the head) was there and contributed itself and it's head. I don't like the name "seen". I don't know a better name now, but we should find one. The "inLoop" is more critical, it's like a request, and thus the inLoop = true can't escape, that's why I set it to false in finally. For the same reason the "inLoop" is set to false before the head is serialized. Head can be or can contain a list, that one must not enter writeObject with inLoop = true, obviously.

So if after calling writeInLoop the ctrl.seen is false, then it was either Nil or already serialized shared sub-list. There is no need to distinguish the two, in either case the loop must stop.

ad 4) Yes, I tried to make read a clear inverse of write.

I've added 1 :-) test into the gist. It is a "shared" thing, and it deserializes properly.

ad side note) You mean like oos.beginWriteObject(obj): Boolean (false if already there and ID written, true if not and ID generated and definition starts) and oos.endWriteObject()?

Regards...
Yes, something like `beginWriteObject` and `endWriteObject` like you described would be ideal.
I have not seen such a facility on the `ObjectOutputStream`.

Otherwise, looks good to me!
You can fork the Scala repo and open a new branch `issue/6961`, apply the patch, build the repo and run all the tests (`ant test`), and then submit a pull request to the Scala repo on GitHub.
Or I can do this for you, as you like.
When it's there, we can rewrite it, well, I actually doubt it will come. Also when the closures don't cost anything, we can simplify the code which tests/creates/resets the thread-local - I believe this will happen much sooner than the first thing.

Thanks! I'll try to do that during the weekend. Of course if there is pressure, please do that now.
Ok, thanks for doing this!
I think there is no rush currently, Jason please correct me if I'm wrong.
If there is, I can submit a pull request, otherwise feel free to submit one and set me as a reviewer (review by @axel22).
Related to that, I just noticed that in this commit:

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b9e01a04618764cceb251830400b1a74ff8f02d3

a part of the test just got commented out. That part of the test was supposed to check if legacy list deserialization works.
The commit message says:

> Hmmm, the giant blob of binary data embedded in a test
> suddenly stopped working. What does one do in this spot.

As I was unsure what are binary compatibility requirements exactly say on serialization, I've implemented legacy deserialization for lists deserialized from 2.9.x.
It seems that just prior to that change, somebody changed something in `List` and legacy deserialization stopped working (could this have also been due to a different JVM version?).

I've just implemented a fallback for legacy deserialization for lists serialized with 2.10.0.
I can send it in, however, I see no way of writing a test for it other than the one I've had in `test/files/run/t5374.scala`.
No problem! :)

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1923
I think we might have a problem. For certain lists the running time of the serialization becomes quadratic.
Think of a list holding objects each of which points to the tail of that list.
If you take a look at `writeObject`, you'll see that the recursive calls ensue, each of which does a while-loop to traverse all the elements.

Changing the list size above `32` results in really long running times. Not to say that it can still result in a stack overflow.

```scala
object Test {

  def deepCopy[T](obj : T, reportSize: Boolean = false): T = {
    val baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
    val oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos)
    oos.writeObject(obj)
    oos.flush()
    val data = baos.toByteArray
    if (reportSize) println(data.length)
    val bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(data)
    val ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais)
    ois.readObject().asInstanceOf[T]
  }
 
  def test() {
    case class Foo(tail: List[Foo])

    def create(len: Int): List[Foo] = if (len == 0) Nil else {
      val tail = create(len - 1)
      Foo(tail) :: tail
    }

    val xs = List.fill(32)(7)
    val dxs = deepCopy(xs, true)
    assert(xs == dxs)

    val ys = create(32)
    val dys = deepCopy(ys, true)
    assert(ys == dys)
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    test()
  }

}
```
