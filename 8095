In UnCurry's `mainTransform()`, there are two cases intended to invokes `liftTree()` on the RHS of `Assign`:
```
      case Assign(Select(_, _), _) =>
        withNeedLift(true) { super.transform(tree) }

      case Assign(lhs, _) if lhs.symbol.owner != currentMethod || lhs.symbol.hasFlag(LAZY | ACCESSOR) =>
        withNeedLift(true) { super.transform(tree) }
```


None of them covers the tree for
```
bar = try { a } catch { case _ => a }
```

which thus falls off to the default case, where no `liftTree()` is invoked. The reason it doesn't match the first case above is that at UnCurry-time the LHS is still an Ident.
