See breakage in r16492 for an example.

To reproduce you need to make sure the pack compiler is built with -Ysqueeze.

Easiest way to reproduce this is probably to flip the switch in Settings to make it turn off by default. Then do an all.clean build and watch it break right at the end. 
It turns out that actually this has nothing to do with squeezing, it's just that squeezing masked many of the error cases. I've now got a test case that doesn't depend on squeeze being off. It's in test/pending/pos/t1480.scala. 

This seems to be a new bug introduced by some of my changes (it works in 2.7.2). I think it's caused by the changes I made in r16341 to fix ticket SI-1260. 
Indeed some quick experimentation confirms: It's caused by the fix to SI-1260. I'm going to revert to the old behaviour for now, as it seems less broken. This will cause a reversion in SI-1260, but hopefully that should be only temporary.
