Without default value syntax, you can't distinguish default value from "reset".
```scala
var x: String = if (x == null) null else x  // don't munge early setting
```
I was just looking at a field that was side-effected from early definition, so the explicit definition would have to be early, too, and not just earlier in the template body.

The comment on the warning:

bq. `val bar: X = bar`, which come up more frequently than you might think.
