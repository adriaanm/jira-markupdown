This issues was created 15 months ago, and I just wanted to point out that while the behavior is different in 2.8, it still isn't good.  Notice how the parameter is specified via the command line, and after the error message stating that '-D' doesn't accept property style arguments, the help documentation within the same output states that is exactly how the input is supposed to be provided.

If the feature is not there, the system shouldn't tell you it is.

'-D' does not accept property style arguments
bad option: '-Ddebug=true'
scala [ <option> ]... [<torun> <arguments>]

All options to scalac are allowed.  See scalac -help.

<torun>, if present, is an object or script file to run.
If no <torun> is present, run an interactive shell.

Option -howtorun allows explicitly specifying how to run <torun>:
    script: it is a script file
    object: it is an object name
    guess: (the default) try to guess

Option -i requests that a file be pre-loaded.  It is only
meaningful for interactive shells.

Option -e requests that its argument be executed as Scala code.

Option -savecompiled requests that the compiled script be saved
for future use.

Option -nocompdaemon requests that the fsc offline compiler not be used.

Option -Dproperty=value sets a Java system property.
