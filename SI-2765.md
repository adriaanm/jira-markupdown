OK so I'm not sure if I understand whether this is intentional, or a bug, or a symptom from Java wildcard type compatibility, but it's not what I expected. Maybe someone can clarify - let me talk you through what I tried to do and what I expected.

The issue is with a type like this:

{code}
List[Foo[A,A] forSome {type A}]
{code}

I would expect this this to allow a list, each of whose values is a Foo[A,A] forSome {type A}, possibly each with a different value for the type A.

I'm using my own Pair[A,B] rather than Tuple2 here because where there's variance the problem goes away (but where there's variance you don't need the existential types anyway):

{code}
scala> case class Pair[A,B](a : A, b : B)
defined class Pair
{code}

Let's make some pairs. Here I don't care what the particular types A and B are, just that the two of them agree - existentially-scoped type to the rescue!

{code}
scala> val x : Pair[A,A] forSome {type A} = Pair(1,1)
x: Pair[_, _] = Pair(1,1)

scala> val y : Pair[A,A] forSome {type A} = Pair("a","a")
y: Pair[_, _] = Pair(a,a)
{code}

OK, great, although are the two underscores in this inferred type separate type parameters (not what I wanted) or actually the same existentially-scoped type variable A (which isn't clear, and isn't consistent with how _ works for value arguments, acting as a different argument each time it appears in an expression) ?

Let's try doing something bad to check:

{code}
scala> val y : Pair[A,A] forSome {type A} = Pair("a",1)
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Pair[java.lang.String,Int]
 required: Pair[_, _]
       val y : Pair[A,A] forSome {type A} = Pair("a",1)
{code}

OK, so it was the same type variable and it is enforcing that, in both places where it appeared, the same type is being used. This is what I wanted.

Now let's try make a list of these different "Pair[A,A] forSome {type A}" values.

{code}
scala> List(x,y)
res0: List[Pair[_ >: A with A, _ >: A with A]] forSome { type A; type A } = List(Pair(1,1), Pair(a,a))
{code}

Uh-oh, that type looks rather dodgy, and not what I wanted. Why are there two A's, why has it not just inferred List[Pair[A,A] forSome {type A}], since I stated that type explicitly for both x and y?

Let me try explicitly typing it as the type which I wanted to use:

{code}
scala> val z : List[Pair[A,A] forSome {type A}] = List(x,y)
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : List[Pair[_ >: A(in value z) with A, _ >: A(in value z) with A]] where type A, type A(in value z)
 required: scala.List[Pair[_, _]]
       val z : List[Pair[A,A] forSome {type A}] = List(x,y)
{code}

Damn. Now I'm really confused. It seems the type system has some language to differentiate between the scope of its two "A" parameters after all - "A(in value z)" - but I still have no idea what it's thinking here. To my mind this should type-check.

Perhaps it's getting confused between List[Pair[A,A] forSome {type A}] and List[Pair[A,A]] forSome {type A} ? Perhaps something else?

Interestingly I note that it works fine with only one type parameter:

{code}
scala> case class Wrapper[A](a: A)
defined class Wrapper

scala> val z : List[Wrapper[A] forSome {type A}] = List(Wrapper(1), Wrapper("s"))
z: List[Wrapper[_]] = List(Wrapper(1), Wrapper(s))
{code}

So I wonder if it's specific to the case where the existentially-scoped type parameter occurs more than once?


If anyone's interested, the motivation for this was something along these lines

{code}
class SQLUpdateStatement(val updatePairs : Iterable[(Column[A], ColumnExpr[A]) forSome {type A}], ...
{code}

I wanted a list of pairs where the type parameter agrees between the column and the value of each pair.
After playing around a bit more, seems it might be something more basic about unification and existential types:

{code}
// to help me see how scala is unifying two types
scala> case class Unify[A](a : A, b : A)
defined class Unify

// A generic container with no variance on its parameter
scala> case class X[A](a: A)
defined class X

// Two container instances with different type parameters
scala> val (x, y) = (X(1), X("a"))
x: X[Int] = X(1)
y: X[java.lang.String] = X(a)

// Let's try unify these types:
scala> Unify(x, y)              
res46: Unify[X[_ >: java.lang.String with Int]] = Unify(X(1),X(a))
{code}

It has inferred an existential type here: X[A] forSome {type A >: String with Int}

This seems wrong - the only possible value for 'type A >: String with Int' would be 'Any', and X[Any] is not a supertype of X[Int] or of X[String], since X has no variance.

This is confirmed by the following errors:

{code}
scala> Unify(x,y) : Unify[X[Any]]
<console>:28: error: type mismatch;
 found   : X[Int]
 required: X[Any]
       Unify(x,y) : Unify[X[Any]]
             ^
<console>:28: error: type mismatch;
 found   : X[java.lang.String]
 required: X[Any]
       Unify(x,y) : Unify[X[Any]]

scala> x : X[Any]
<console>:15: error: type mismatch;
 found   : X[Int]
 required: X[Any]
{code}

So why did it infer that type?

If it wants to infer an existential type it seems that X[A] forSome {type A} should be a valid supertype for both. But if you try and give it a helping hand to infer this, it doesn't work:

{code}
scala> val y : X[A] forSome {type A} = X("a")
y: X[_] = X(a)

scala> val x : X[A] forSome {type A} = X(1)  
x: X[_] = X(1)

scala> Unify(x,y)
<console>:17: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unify[X[_ >: A(in object $$iw) with A]] where type A, type A(in object $$iw)
 required: Unify[X[_ >: A(in value res54) with A(in value res54)]] forSome { type A(in value res54); type A(in value res54) }
       val res54 = 
{code}
Oops, sorry ignore me and my confused ramblings there :)
I realised String and Int are both valid supertypes of "String with Int"

Although still curious why the last example there fails.

First, there was a bug in the way existential types are printed. It printed them with wildcards even if there was sharing. This will corrected in my next checkin. Second, try writing the definition of y like this:
{code}
 val y : Pair[B,B] forSome {type B} = Pair("a","a") 
{code}
this is exactly the same as yours; the type name is locally bound, so using A as a type parameter twice will have no effect except add confusion. Alternatively you could try to compile or use the REPL with -uniqid.
With the changed output method, I now get:
{code}
scala> List(x, y)
res1: List[Pair[_3,_4] forSome { type _3 >: B with A; type _4 >: B with A }] forSome { type B; type A } = List(Pair(1,1), Pair(a,a))
{code}
This is the type I would expect. The problem here is when you write x, y, their (existential) types are unpacked, like this:
{code}
  x: Pair['A, 'A]
  y: Pair['B, 'B]
{code}
for some unknown types 'A, 'B which correspond to the type parameters A, B.
When forming the List(x, y), the resulting type is packed again. 

You would probably like the type of x and y to not be unpacked and the resulting existential to be used as the list element type. But that's not how existentials work in Scala. In fact specifying something like that would make them highly ambiguous.
