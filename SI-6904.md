```scala
object Test {
  class Bippy[A]
  
  def foo[Result[_]] = new {
    private type Elem[B] = Result[B]
    
    def bar: Result[Elem[Int]] = sys.error("TODO")
  }
  
  // error: Cannot prove that Test.Bippy[Test.Bippy[Int]] =:= Test.Bippy[Result[Int]].
  check[Bippy[Bippy[Int]]](foo[Bippy].bar)
  
  def check[A] = new {
    def apply[B](b: B)(implicit ev: A =:= B) = ()
  }
}
```

The "check" function is simply to assert inferred type equivalence without triggering implicit conversion or subtype coercion.  If I inline "Elem", this works just fine.  Similarly, if I use a named class as the return type of "foo", rather than new {}, there is again no problem.
Simplified, with enhanced contrast (not that I object to bringing in Bippy.)
```scala
object Test {
  def foo1[A1] = new { private type A2 = A1 ; def bar: A2 = ??? }
  def foo2[A1] = new {         type A2 = A1 ; def bar: A2 = ??? }

  def f1 = check[Int](foo1[Int].bar)
  def f2 = check[Int](foo2[Int].bar)

  def check[A] = new { def apply[B](b: B)(implicit ev: A =:= B) = () }
}
```
There's no question this is a bug - look at the inferred type of foo1. Not only is A2 private, it is no longer in scope. Two for the price of one.
```scala
def foo1[A1 >: Nothing <: Any]: AnyRef{def bar: this.A2}
def foo2[A1 >: Nothing <: Any]: AnyRef{type A2 = A1; def bar: this.A2}
```
...though one could see those as manifestation of the same thing.

Here's some code from one of my infinite variety of unpublished branches.
```scala
  /** Weaken the type of the symbol's info such that it doesn't contain
   *  symbols with tighter access restriction than the symbol itself.
   *  Since lubs are calculated without considering these requirements,
   *  they tend to include inaccessible types.
   */
  class WeakenToVisible(owner: Symbol) extends TypeMap {
    def isTighter(tp: Type) = (
         (tp.typeSymbol isLessAccessibleThan owner)
      && (tp.typeSymbolDirect isLessAccessibleThan owner)
    )
    def visibleParents(tps: List[Type]): List[Type] = {
      val tps1 = tps flatMap (tp =>
        if (isTighter(tp)) visibleParents(tp.parents)
        else List(tp)
      )
      // "flatMapConserve" to avoid new refined types.
      if ((tps corresponds tps1)(_ eq _)) tps
      else elimSuper(tps1)
    }
    def apply(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
      case rt @ RefinedType(ps, decls)       => copyRefinedType(rt, visibleParents(ps), mapOver(decls))
      case PolyType(_, _)                    => mapOver(tp)
      case MethodType(_, _)                  => mapOver(tp)
      case ExistentialType(_, _)             => mapOver(tp)
      case TypeRef(_, sym, _) if sym.isClass => mapOver(tp)
      case _                                 => tp
    }
  }
```
