I still don't understand the issue.

{code}
trait SuperC[A,B] {
  def getB(a: A): B
}

trait Foo {
  type A
  type B
  type C <: SuperC[A,B]
}

class Bar[F<:Foo](a: F#A, c: F#C) {
  val b = c.getB(a)
}

/*
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Bar.this.a.type (with underlying type F#A)
 required: _81.A where val _81: F
         val b = c.getB(a)
                        ^
*/

class MyFoo extends Foo {
  type A = Int
  type B = Int
  type C = MyC
  // ...
}
trait MyC extends SuperC[Int,Int] {
  // ...
}
class MySubC extends MyC{
  def getB(a: Int): Int = ???
  // ...
}
{code}

Thanks.
This works:

{code}
trait SuperC[A,B] {
  def getB(a: A): B
  // ...
}

trait Foo {
  type A
  type B
  type C <: SuperC[A,B]
  // ...
}

class Bar[F <: Foo with Singleton](a: F#A, cs: List[F#C]) {
  cs.head.getB(a)
}
{code}

True, but given:
{code}
trait SuperC[A,B] {
  def getB(a: A): B
}

trait Foo {
  type A
  type B
  type C <: SuperC[A,B]
}

class Bar[F<:Foo with Singleton](a: F#A, c: F#C) {
  val b = c.getB(a)
}

class MyFoo extends Foo {
  type A = Int
  type B = Int
  type C = MyC
}
trait MyC extends SuperC[Int,Int]
class MySubC extends MyC{
  def getB(a: Int): Int = 3
}
{code}
I can:
{code}
object Main_ {
  val myFoo = new MyFoo
  val mySC = new MySubC
  new Bar(3, mySC)
}
/*
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(3)
 required: ?#A
         new Bar(3, mySC)
                 ^
*/
{code}
or
{code}
object Main_ {
  val myFoo = new MyFoo
  val mySC = new MySubC
  new Bar[MyFoo](3, mySC)
}
/*
error: type arguments [MyFoo] do not conform to class Bar's type parameter bounds [F <: Foo with Singleton]
         new Bar[MyFoo](3, mySC)
             ^
*/
{code}
or
{code}
object Main_ {
  val myFoo = new MyFoo
  val mySC = new MySubC
  val bar = new Bar[MyFoo with Singleton](3, mySC)
}
{code}
But then I have to drag Singleton around everywhere.  And if I pop up a level on my simplification stack:
{code}
  trait SuperC[A,B] {
    def getB(a: A): B
  }

  trait Foo[F<:Foo[F]] {
    type A
    type B
    type C <: SuperC[A,B]

  }

  class Bar[F<:Foo[F] with Singleton](a: F#A, c: F#C) {
    val b = c.getB(a)
  }

  class MyFoo extends Foo[MyFoo with Singleton] {
    type A = Int
    type B = Int
    type C = MyC
  }
  trait MyC extends SuperC[Int,Int]
  class MySubC extends MyC{
    def getB(a: Int): Int = 3
  }
  object Main_ {
    val myFoo = new MyFoo
    val mySC = new MySubC
    new Bar[MyFoo with Singleton](3, mySC)
  }
{code}
I'm accumulating Singleton at an alarming pace :-)

But at any rate, as much as I'd like to get help fixing my design, I don't mean to spam up this error-message-improving ticket.
Do you have a suggestion for what the error message would say which would be useful to you? It's going to be some variation of "if only F were a Singleton this might be sound", but if you already knew that then I don't know how much help it's going to be to improve it.

_81 is a fictional value which was sought but not found; it ties F#A and F#C together with a common prefix. Your code is written as if an F#A and an F#C are as intimate with one another as an f.A and an f.C, and as you discovered, they aren't. You might try something like
{code}
class Bar[F <: Foo](val f: F) {
  def apply(a: f.A, c: f.C) = c.getB(a)
}
{code}
You should be able to write
{code}
class Bar[F <: Foo](val f: F)(a: f.A, c: f.C) { }
{code}
but there's SI-5712 so it works for methods but not classes.
