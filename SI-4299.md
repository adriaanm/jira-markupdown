I could understand not being too keen to fix this, but since we have embedded it into the core of the collections I feel like we should either fix it or change mkString.

The situation is: if a method is overloaded and one of those overloads is nullary, and then one of the non-nullary methods is overridden in a subclass, calls to the nullary method are treated as ambiguous.

The ambiguity can be resolved by annotating the expression as a String.

Perhaps this sounds like a corner case, but the three mkString overloads all go through the 3-argument version, so the natural/obvious way to change it is to override it.  And then xs.mkString no longer works.

I suppose this is why all the collections which override it override all three overloads.

{code}
class Bippy extends collection.TraversableViewLike[Int, List[Int], Bippy] with collection.TraversableView[Int, List[Int]] {
  def underlying = List(1,2,3)
  def foreach[U](f: Int => U) = underlying foreach f
  override def mkString(s: String, m: String, e: String): String = "hi"
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = new Bippy
    println(x.mkString)
  }
}

// % scalac29 a.scala 
// a.scala:10: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
// both method mkString in class Bippy of type (s: String,m: String,e: String)String
// and  method mkString in trait TraversableOnce of type => String
// match expected type Any
//     println(x.mkString)
//               ^
// one error found
{code}

Actually I see a collection on the compiler side which doesn't override all three, which demonstrates this is an issue in practice.

adding a `: String` expected type annotation works around this -- the only language change we would consider to fix this is to drop implicitly eta-expanding unapplied methods (use underscores instead)

The title should be "good overloading/overriding interaction."  Changing mkString for extensibility seems right, by calling a common protected template method.

This is an interesting case in that nullary mkString is "specialized" but not in a way that subtyping tells us anything about.
