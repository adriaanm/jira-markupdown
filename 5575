Took a quick look. First, Utility.serialize is the non-formatting option. Second the PrettyPrinter is pretty ugly. It's not obvious whether it's trying to minimize verticality. When is GSOC again?
{code}
scala> val xx = <a>{ PCData("Here is some very long text\nto split.") }</a>
xx: scala.xml.Elem =
<a><![CDATA[Here is some very long text
to split.]]></a>

scala> val pp = new PrettyPrinter(1000,2)
pp: scala.xml.PrettyPrinter = scala.xml.PrettyPrinter@13275d8

scala> pp format xx
res7: String = <a><![CDATA[Here is some very long text to split.]]></a>

scala> val pp = new PrettyPrinter(10,2)
pp: scala.xml.PrettyPrinter = scala.xml.PrettyPrinter@673919a7

scala> pp format xx
res8: String =
<a>
  <![CDATA[Here is some very long text
to split.]]>
</a>

scala> val pp = new PrettyPrinter(2,2)
pp: scala.xml.PrettyPrinter = scala.xml.PrettyPrinter@41853299

scala> pp format xx
res9: String =
"<a><![CDATA[Here is some very long text to split.]]></a>
"
