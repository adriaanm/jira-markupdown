The code snippet below print "Boo" 4 times which is wrong, it should only print 3 Boo and a 'Go New York'.

        val matchNY = "^.*New.*$".r

        val teams = List(
            "Toronto Raptor",
            "New York Nets",
            "San Francisco 49ers",
            "Dallas Mavericks"
        )

        for (team <- teams) {
            team match {
                case `matchNY` => println("Go New York.")
                case _ => println("Boo")
            }
        }


I've opened SI-7211 to issue a warning in this case; the compiler knows that a {{String}} can't be equal to a {{Regex}}, either because a) {{String}} is final and doesn't inherit {{Regex}}, or b) both are classes, and other classes can only inherit one.
