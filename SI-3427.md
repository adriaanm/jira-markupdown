I tried to migrate lib.web from 2.8.0.RC1 to RC2 and got strange compiler errors. Please see attached console log.

The first [ERROR] is this: exception when typing final class Servlet extends javax.servlet.http.!HttpServlet with java.lang.Object with !ScalaObject {scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$!TypeError: class Object needs to be a trait to be mixed in

But my class Servlet is defined as this:
{code}
final class Servlet extends HttpServlet with NotNull {...}
{code}
without any explicit constructors inside.

I'm afraid I'll have to upload the whole project if this log does not provide enough information and you need to reproduce errors.
I've chosen the path of enforcing as many restrictions via type system as possible. !NotNull is just one of measures. Unfortunately, it's not as powerful as it could be:

{code}
def f(s: String with NotNull) {}
val s = "Hello" // String, but could be String with NotNull
f(s)            // compiler error
{code}

Does "won't appear soon" mean that 2.8.0.Final may leave this unfixed? If fix is planned for 2.8.0, then I'd prefer to wait and use on RC1 for now.
I will definitely fix SI-3417 for the next RC (which I think this bug is a duplicate of). 
I'm pretty certain this is a duplicate of SI-3417, as was SI-3440.
