@Paul Phillips it was obvious, don't worry. :)

(speaking of JIRA UX, I'm trying to figure out the right way to "mention" someone...)

As for the explanation, I see what you mean now. I was too focused on the next line, `case r:Result[U] => Success(r.result)`.

Indeed, this does compile:
```scala
case class C[A](a: A, modify: A => A)
def test[A](c: C[A]): C[A] = c match { case C(x, f) => C(f(x), f) } 
```
