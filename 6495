Yeah; I really don't understand why they're not being garbage collected in my case, because they should indeed be short-lived.  But somehow these {{DynamicVariable}} objects and the associated parsers are staying around.

Examining the heap dump, it seems like the thread object has an array of inherited thread locals which contain the {{DynamicVariable}} objects, so just looking at it from a naive point of view, it seems like the dynamic variables and the associated parsers should remain alive in perpetuity. And that's the behavior that I'm currently seeing; but it seems to me like, if that were really the case, then {{DynamicVariable}} would be very hard to use safely, so there has to be something that I'm missing. (And this actually used to work fine for me, before making what should have been a relatively minor change in the code.)

I dunno; I'll try to come up with an isolated test case so I can understand when my hundreds of thousands of not garbage collected parsers are coming from...
