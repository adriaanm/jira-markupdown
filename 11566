The problem turns out to be the raw `JComboBox` type, resulting from the call to scala-swing's un-parameterized `peer` method.

The following very ugly workaround not only makes the compiler not crash, it also works:
`cb.peer.asInstanceOf[javax.swing.JComboBox[Int]].setModel(m.asInstanceOf[javax.swing.ComboBoxModel[Int]])`
