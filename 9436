You could give a better error message by explicitly checking for Unapply nodes. I'm not sure if they are all broken, or just ones with varargs.

Or, you can use your a copy of ResetAttrs that does something like: https://github.com/retronym/scala/commit/c17b92b7d. I'll refine that patch in the coming days.

We took that same approach in scala-async to work around SI-6187 with Scala 2.10.0, and I'll update our copy of ResetAttrs to workaround this bug, and you could borrow the code.
