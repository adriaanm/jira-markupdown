If you compile the following code:
```scala
class Do(f: => Unit) { 
  def exec() { f } 
} 
```
You obtain the following behaviour:
```scala
scala> new Do{ println("Hello"); println("There") }  
Hello
There
res3: Do = $$anon$$1@761f9da

scala> res3.exec
```
In other words, it appears to be a by-name parameter but it functions as though it is by value.

I think this is could easily catch people out and should generate a compile error like:
  "by-name parameters are not permitted on classes"
