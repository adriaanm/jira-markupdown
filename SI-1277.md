I write a simple "Hello world" app, yet there is a pink underline under the opening quote on "Hello world" - even though this is a valid program.  Screenshot attached.
I'm reopening this because I don't see any evidence that this is an Eclipse bug.
See also #1522 (which was marked a dup of this bug). If this bug is fixed, please ensure that it fixes the scenario in #1522 also. Screenshot: https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/attachment/ticket/1522/window.png
In trunk build, Ive entered both the example given here and the one in #1522. Neither now show pink underline, save for correct error that method FOR defined twice.

Some change appears to have fixed this. Re-open if a failing example can be found.
