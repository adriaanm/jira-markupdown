=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
  /**
   * <strong><code>failedTestCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString</code> has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
   * ScalaTest. Please call <code>failedCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString</code> instead.</strong>
   */
   @deprecated // deprecated in 1.0, remove in 1.4
   val failedTestCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString: Option[String] = failedCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString

```

=== Additional information ===

The Scaladoc output is:

<p class="shortcomment
cmt"><strong><code>failedTestCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString</code>
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
ScalaTest.</p>
          <div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment
cmt"><p><strong><code>failedTestCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString</code>
has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of
ScalaTest. Please call
<code>failedCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString</code> instead.</strong>
</p>

So the </strong> shows up in the fullcomment, but not the
shortcomment. That makes the rest of the method list comments all
appear in bold. This happens pretty much on any ScalaTest trait or
class that has something deprecated in it, which is a lot of things.
It also screws up the JavaScript for the method with the problem,
because if you click on the method, it hides the short comment,
doesn't show the full comment, and then no matter how much mad
clicking you do on that method thereafter, it won't show either the
full or short comment.

The same thing happens with <em> tags (see #4358)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: Scala code runner version 2.8.1.final -- Copyright 2002-2010, LAMP/EPFL
  - Java: java version "1.6.0_18"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.7) (fedora-50.1.8.7.fc13-i386)
OpenJDK Server VM (build 14.0-b16, mixed mode)

This needs to be fixed for 2.9 final, but there is a workaround: you can use wiki syntax for bold and italic (* and _, respectively). I verified that this produces the correct short comment.
So, that turned on wiki formatting in the comment!

```scala
* = bold
_  = italic
```
