It looks like there are no major objections.  I certainly would like it to go in, because it will help with explaining to people how functions work in Scala.

The main issue is that this change will break binary compatibility, causing all jar's to need recompilation.  Thus, I will not do it just yet.  Does the EPFL gang have a release planned that will break binary compatibility, anyway?  I am assigning it to devteam for input.  Please choose the best milestone, including the immediate release if the binary compatibility break is acceptible.


I can do the coding when the time comes, since I asked for it, though volunteers would be welcome, too!  The main things to do will be:
 * Add a default isDefinedAt to Function1
 * Make "PartialFunction" a deprecated alias in Predef
 * Make the pattern matcher always generate isDefinedAt
