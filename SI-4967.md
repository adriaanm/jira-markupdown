According to [http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814#AVNormalize] (section 3.3.3), leading and trailing space in non-CDATA attribute values should be discarded before passing the value to the application.


{code}val xml = <root><e attr=" test"/></root>{code}

Expected
{code}(xml \ "e" \ "@attr") == "test"{code}

Actual
{code}(xml \ "e" \ "@attr") == " test"{code}


Before I look at the source related to this, I'd like to confirm that I've correctly interpreted both the standard and the current behaviour in relation to the standard.  If anyone feels that the behaviour I was expecting is correct and would like me to help in any way, let me know and I'll be happy to do my part.

In general, if you are asking a question or are unsure if something is a bug, use the mailing lists.

In this case, I assume you are referring to this:
```
If the attribute type is not CDATA, then the XML processor must further process the normalized attribute value by discarding any leading and trailing space (#x20) characters, ...
```

However,
```
All attributes for which no declaration has been read should be treated by a non-validating processor as if declared CDATA.
```
Thanks Mark,

My sincere apologies for using the incorrect forum.  I over-simplified the problem to the point it was no longer a correct description.  I have since determined that (in the unsimplified code) I was incorrectly relying on the ValidatorHandler obtained from javax.xml.validation.Schema.newValidatorHandler, which was passing attribute values to its ContentHandler without normalizing their values, as I was expecting (since by its name and otherwise, generally, its behaviour, it is a validating processor).  By switching to use SchemaFactory.newSAXParser (with appropriate configuration of the factory), I can obtain the desired behaviour.

All of this is obviously outside the realms of Scala, but thought I'd note it here in case my initial comment started anyone else down a time-wasting path.
