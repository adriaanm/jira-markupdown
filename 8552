You should not use {{scala.Enumeration$Value}} from Scala code, period. It's a complete accident that it works. Scala never requires you to use $ in identifiers; in fact you are discouraged strongly from doing so as it can lead you into these problems.

If you need help converting code away from it, pop a note to scala-user.
