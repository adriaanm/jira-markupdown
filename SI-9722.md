Search in new doc tool output at http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/2.12.x/api/2.12.x/ fails to find inner types like <:< and LeftProjection.
This is because the current index is only generated for {{val}} s and {{def}} s (in addition to top-level entities). I have a branch to deal with this, but there's still an issue where {{final case class}} es don't make it to the final index for some reason...debugging :(
