Fair enough. But there seems to be different behaviour when doing the same thing as the interpreter code in compiled code. The following ostensibly equivalent code works fine:

{code}
object ArrayAny{
  def main(args : Array[String]){
    val it = Array(1, 2, 3);

    println(it.toArray[Any]);
  }
}
{code}

Which is why I reported this as an interpreter issue. Your version seems like a more likely root cause though, yes.
