As part of the resolution to #3791, `Double.MinLong` (and similar) were deprecated.

I just noticed that similar definitions exist on `BigInt` and `BigDecimal`, and in fact refer to the now-deprecated methods. I suggest a similar deprecation and introduction of new methods for consistency.

Assigning to Lukas, who worked on the previous ticket.
(In r23515) Cleaned up some hangover from equality struggles of yore.
Deprecated now pointless vals.  Close #3998, no review.
