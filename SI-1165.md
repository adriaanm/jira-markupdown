Ctrl-click doesn't open library files. Say, Ctr-click on Array outs on console

```scala

error with bad pos(OffsetPosition(Array.scala,1790)): value += is not a member of Int
error with bad pos(OffsetPosition(Array.scala,1937)): value += is not a member of Int
error with bad pos(OffsetPosition(Array.scala,2700)): value += is not a member of Int
error with bad pos(OffsetPosition(Array.scala,3442)): value += is not a member of Int
error with bad pos(OffsetPosition(Array.scala,3606)): value += is not a member of Int
error with bad pos(OffsetPosition(Array.scala,3773)): value += is not a member of Int
...
```

New tab opens but shows something funny - say the same screen with source (where click was done) file (just show without editing-scrolling possibilities).

All such errors claims about += value. 
r15677 is in use with Eclipse 3.4.

Regression.
Fixed in r15688.

The "error with bad pos ..." reports on the console are unrelated.
