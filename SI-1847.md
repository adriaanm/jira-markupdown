If I have a JPA entity containing something like
```scala
  @OneToMany{val mappedBy = "user",
	     val cascade = Array(CascadeType.ALL),
	     val fetch = FetchType.LAZY }
  var roles : java.util.List[UserRole] = new java.util.Vector[UserRole]
```

eclipselink complains about

```scala
The target entity of the relationship attribute [roles] on the
class [class com.example.User] cannot be determined.  When not
using generics, ensure the target entity is defined on the
relationship mapping.
```

I have to change the annotation to
```scala
  @OneToMany{val mappedBy = "user",
	     val cascade = Array(CascadeType.ALL),
	     val targetEntity = classOf[UserRole],
	     val fetch = FetchType.LAZY }
```

It seems like the classfile is missing some information about the generic types that should be there.
This might be a duplicate of #1395, Signature attributes not being generated for private members. Could you check that it works with a nightly build?
