{code}
class Employee(val name: String)
class Manager (override val name: String, val dept: String) extends Employee(name)

class Award[T](val recipient: T)

 val e = new Employee("Rose")
	  val m = new Manager("Gosling", "Java")
	  val mgrAwd: Award[Manager] = new Award(m)
	  val a: Award[Employee] = new Award(m) // THIS COMPILES but T is invariant
	  val b: Award[Employee] = mgrAwd // this does not compile
{code}

Variance restrictions do not prevent the compiler from inferring a valid type. A "Manager" is also an "Employee". Invariance means this would fail:
{code}
val a: Award[Employee] = new Award[Manager](m)
{code}
It does not mean value "m" cannot be seen as an Employee. Please ask on a mailing list if you have any questions.
