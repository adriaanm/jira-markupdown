There's something deeply wrong with owners and refined types. I mean, it is fundamentally a problematic design because the owner of a refined type does not really make sense. But we need it to satisfy a lot of other invariants.

My strong advice would be to do as little as you can. I am convinced there is no satisfactory fix given the current compiler architecture. So when something is messy, better stirr up as little as possible! Inconsistencies in toolboxes are no reason to lose time over this. Just ignore the owner when computing the SBT hashes and you will be fine.
