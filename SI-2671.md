Scala.bat does not execute on the 64-bit version of Windows 7, possibly neither on Windows Vista x64 (not tested).

Reason seems to be the way Windows x64 stores 32-bit applications, namely in a folder called "Program Files (x86)". It appears that the parenthesis prevents the batch file from executing properly.

As a workaround, I modified the usage of double quotes in the batch file, which works fine on my system (see attached file).

I'd like to ask you to check these modification, especially if it will affect proper execution on other Windows versions.
Ugh - my diff got wikified - let me try again:

```scala
C:\Scala28\bin
> C:/cygwin/bin/diff scalac.bat.original scalac.bat
28,36c28,30
< set _JAVACMD=%JAVACMD%
<
< if "%_JAVACMD%"=="" (
<   if not "%JAVA_HOME%"=="" (
<     if exist "%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe" set _JAVACMD=%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe
<   )
< )
<
< if "%_JAVACMD%"=="" set _JAVACMD=java
---
> if defined JAVA_HOME set _JAVACMD=%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe
> if not defined JAVA_HOME set _JAVACMD=java
> if defined JAVACMD set _JAVACMD=%JAVACMD%
```
FYI - this is still busted in RC1.

For person who will handle it, you can look for inspiration at rabbitmq sources, they also spent some time on fighting windows issues:
```scala
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/9c8bb16868d8/scripts/
```
(In r24490) Reworked windows batch files; should fix #2671.
