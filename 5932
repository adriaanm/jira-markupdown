As far as I know there is no random number generator in the compiler, so there must be some deterministic way of triggering this. We just don't know what it is yet. I bet  **something** was different in the environment between those two runs.

Maybe it's caches filling up, or other limits being reached, but I find it hard to believe it's just a matter of using the compiler daemon at certain time intervals. Are you sure your classpath was the same (with the same contents) everytime? Maybe you had some stale classfiles laying around? Can you try with fsc as well (I sure hope this can't be reproduced with scalac!). 

There must be a deterministic way to trigger both results; lacking that, I'm afraid it's going to be nearly impossible to fix. (I did try to repro, will try again in an hour...)
