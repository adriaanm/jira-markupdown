I have a class that I can implicitly convert to NodeSeq.  It looks something like this:

```scala
import scala.xml._

class Xmlable(val i: Int)

object Xmlable {
  implicit def xmlableToNodeSeq(x: Xmlable): NodeSeq = Text("i = " + x.i)
}
```

I'm surprised that when I use an instance of Xmltable this class in a XML-mode Scala escape expression (not sure exactly what the name for it is), Scala does not invoke the implicit conversion.  It seems like it would make sense for Scala to attempt to convert the escape expression to a NodeSeq and only fall back on a default conversion (to Atom or Text via toString) if necessary.

Strangely Scala does use the implicit conversion if I use an Xmlable as an attribute.

```scala
scala> import scala.xml._    
import scala.xml._

scala> val x = new Xmlable(1)
x: Xmlable = Xmlable@de35b38

scala> val ns: NodeSeq = x // Implicit conversion used  
ns: scala.xml.NodeSeq = i = 1

scala> <sometag attr={x}/> // Implicit conversion used
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <sometag attr="i = 1"></sometag>

scala> <sometag>{x}</sometag> // Implicit conversion NOT used
res1: scala.xml.Elem = <sometag>Xmlable@de35b38</sometag>
```
Not in the official specification, but according to the unofficial one:

The first translates to
```scala
  new UnprefixedAttribute("attr", x, xml.Null)
```
while the second translates to
```scala
  val buffer = new xml.NodeBuffer
  buffer &+ x
  new xml.Elem(null, "sometag", xml.Null, scope, buffer)
```
!UnprefixedAttribute has overloaded constructors:
```scala
    new UnprefixedAttribute(key: String, value: String, next: MetaData)
    new UnprefixedAttribute(key: String, value: Seq[Node], next1: MetaData)
    new UnprefixedAttribute(key: String, value: Option[Seq[Node]], next: MetaData)
```
The signature of `&+` is:
```scala
   &+(o: Any): NodeBuffer
```

So, an attribute value must conform to `String`, `Seq[Node]`, or `Option[Seq[Node]]`.  Element content is allowed to be anything and so implicits are never considered.

This is also why
```scala
  <sometag attr={1}/>
```
doesn't work, but this does:
```scala
  <sometag>{1}</sometag>
```

In any case, this is essentially the same issue as #1787 and should probably be closed as a duplicate.
Well, perhaps it is different enough to be a separate ticket.  With the attached patch:

```scala
scala> <sometag>{3}</sometag>   
res1: scala.xml.Elem = <sometag>3</sometag>

scala> <sometag>{new Xmlable(3)}</sometag>
res2: scala.xml.Elem = <sometag>i = 3</sometag>
```

In theory it should be source compatible (test suite passes), but I'm sure it breaks someone's code somewhere. 

#1787 requires a more invasive approach since type parameters aren't allowed on auxiliary constructors.
The patch is very elegant!  I've learned a couple of things about Scala just by looking at it.  For some reason it never occurred to me that I could default an implicit parameter.

I'd be surprised if there are too much existing code where (a) some class X is defined, (b) there's an implicit conversion from X to NodeSeq in scope, and (c) an expression evaluating to X is used within {}, but (d) the developer expects the X to be converted to NodeSeq via toString.

One suggestion: If the method is called with an Iterable[T] and there is an implicit conversion from T to NodeSeq in scope, then IMHO the method should map the Iterable with the conversion function before passing it to addAny.

The signature is the right one, in my opinion.  You could add an overload on Seq[T], but you can't have overloaded methods with defaults and even if you could, you are restricting yourself to one level of nesting.

Rather, the caller could define an implicit like:
```scala
implicit def views[T](x: Seq[T])(implicit view: T => Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] =
  x flatMap view
```

With that you can nest arbitrarily:
```scala
scala> val xs = Seq(3,4) map (new Xmlable(_))
xs: Seq[Xmlable] = List(Xmlable@6d172f8f, Xmlable@d338d3d)
                                
scala <x>{Seq(xs,xs)}</x>
res4: scala.xml.Elem = <x>i = 3i = 4i = 3i = 4</x>
```
