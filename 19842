I noticed that in 2.12.x, `DefaultPromise` has inherited the `toString` of the its new parent,  `AtomicReference`.

{code}
scala> Promise.apply[String]()
res16: scala.concurrent.Promise[String] = List()
{code}

This unnecessarily leaks implementation details.

I think "<promise>" would be better. We might want to include the completion status, too.

`Future` could take the same treatment.
