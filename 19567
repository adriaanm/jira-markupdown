The compiler command options are legion.

Sometimes my bash autocomplete isn't up-to-date.

It would be nice if scalac could help me remember those options which are some permutation of X, Y, print, show, log, debug and uniq (not unique or unix).

Something like:
{code}
$ skalac -help -show
scalac error: bad option: '-show'
  Similar options:
  -Yshow-member-pos
  -Xshow-object
  -Yshow-syms
  -Yshow-trees-stringified
  -Xshow-phases
  -Yshow-trees-compact
  -Yshow-symowners
  -Yshow-trees
  -Yshow
  -Xshow-class
  -Yshow-symkinds
  `scalac -help` gives more information
{code}
