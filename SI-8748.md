If I define a typeclass in a class's companion object and use it in the class, like this:

{code:title=Util.scala|borderStyle=solid}
class Util {
	import Util._

	val reading = implicitly[Read[Int]].read("100")
}

object Util {
	sealed trait Read[T] {
		def read(s: String): T
	}

	implicit object IntRead extends Read[Int] { def read(s: String) = s.toInt }
}
{code}

The following compilation error is fired:

error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: Util.Read[Int]
       val reading = implicitly[Read[Int]].read("100")

But if the object is defined before the class, it works OK.

{code:title=Util.scala|borderStyle=solid}
object Util {
	sealed trait Read[T] {
		def read(s: String): T
	}

	implicit object IntRead extends Read[Int] { def read(s: String) = s.toInt }
}

class Util {
	import Util._

	val reading = implicitly[Read[Int]].read("100")
}
{code}

I'm not sure whether this is an intended behaviour? But it doesn't feel right since it shouldn't matter to the developer the order of class and its companion object.

Note that these also happens for traits.
This is a duplicate of SI-8697.

See the comments in the ticket: it might not be possible to change this behavior...
Yeah, these two issues do look similar.
But I think they're a bit different in the sense that, in SI-8697, it's two objects.
but In this issue, it turns out to be the trait and its companion object.

I kind of get the impression that the trait should be defined before its companion object, at least in usual scala code style.
But if this issue exists, it violates this code style.

Moreover, in this issue and in SI-8697, the implicit can not be found even after it has been imported into the scope.
This is kind of a bummer.
