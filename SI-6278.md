Implicit def synthesis from an implicit class suffers from the dread forward reference bug.

```scala
object tiny {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    ok(); nope()
  }
  def ok() {
    class Foo(val i: Int) {
      def foo[A](body: =>A): A = body
    }
    implicit def toFoo(i: Int): Foo = new Foo(i)

    val k = 1
    k foo println("k?")
    val j = 2
  }
  def nope() {
    implicit class Foo(val i: Int) {
      def foo[A](body: =>A): A = body
    }

    val k = 1
    k foo println("k?")
    //lazy
    val j = 2
  }
}
```
I've added a case to the addSynthetics code which is (ironically) sorting the implicit def to the end of the class body.

"Pretty ugly", that useful oxymoron; but for now, limited to the three cases.

As nice issue tracker feature would be: when I create a ticket, let me post my test code which gets put immediately into the repo under tests/pending with the useful file name; then PR acceptance means that test passes and the test is moved to non-pending and the ticket is closed.

Linked to #6227 because this fix depends on naming convention.
Note:  Errors with:

```scala

Thanks, Josh, for adding the error message.

Amended PR:
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1230
Is a PR against 2.10 required, or does an oompa-loompa do the merge? Thx.
Back-applied patch to 2.10.x.

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1277

Learned about git format-patch and git am.  Was that the most appropriate workflow?

A vermicious knid ate my patch file.
I'd have gone for `git co 2.10.x; git cherry-pick <hash>`.
