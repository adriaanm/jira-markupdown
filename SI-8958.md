[~moors] And add a ticket for each proposed addition, and leave it open until we get far enough into the planning stages so we can reasonably decide yea or nay on each one? (And re-open closed tickets?)
[~moors] - Sure as long as that isn't too general.  We can try that to start and add another flag if it gets cluttered up with things that aren't essentially notes to ourselves on what to consider.
