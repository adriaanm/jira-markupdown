Having the following Java interfaces:
```java
public interface Promise<T> {
  <R> Promise<R> map(SuccessHandler<? super T, ? extends R> handler);
  <R> Promise<R> map(FutureSuccessHandler<? super T, R> handler);
}
```
```java
public interface SuccessHandler<T, R> {
  R handle(T result);
}
```
```java
public interface FutureSuccessHandler<T,R> {
  Promise<R> handle(T result);
}
```

Where Promise#map method contains two overloads, receiving two different interfaces and using bounded wildcards, Scala fails to choose which overload to use having the following code:
```scala
object Test {
  val promise: Promise[String] = ???
  promise.map(new SuccessHandler[String, Int] {
    override def handle(result: String): Int = ???
  })
}
```

Failing on compilation error:

(Using directly scalac and providing classpath):
```java
Test.scala:9: error: overloaded method value map with alternatives:
  [R](x$1: test.FutureSuccessHandler[_ >: String, R])test.Promise[R] <and>
  [R](x$1: test.SuccessHandler[_ >: String, _ <: R])test.Promise[R]
 cannot be applied to (test.SuccessHandler[String,Int])
  promise.map(new SuccessHandler[String, Int] {
          ^
one error found
```

(Using Maven with scala-maven-plugin):
```java
[INFO] Using incremental compilation

 cannot be applied to (test.SuccessHandler[String,Int])
[ERROR]   promise.map(new SuccessHandler[String, Int] {
[ERROR]           ^
[ERROR] one error found
```

Now, interesting things about the issue:
1. Having this line: 'promise.map(new SuccessHandler[String, Int]', changing the parameter type R to be also String (instead of Int), leads the code to compile successfully (when 'SuccessHandler' generic types are the same, all works fine).
2. Signatures of the 'map' methods containing bounded wildcard as defined below:
```java
<R> Promise<R> map(SuccessHandler<? super T, ? extends R> handler);
<R> Promise<R> map(FutureSuccessHandler<? super T, R> handler);
```

if I remove the lower bounded wildcards (from both methods) everything compiles without any issues.
The issue looks like caused by the wildcards, but have no idea more why.
