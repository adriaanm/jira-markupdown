Daniel, have you actually tried the code you pasted with Scala 2.8.0?
```scala
scala> val m2 = m1('a) = 3
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
m2: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Symbol,Int] = Map(('a,3), ('b,2))
```
```scala
@deprecated("use `updated' instead")
def update[B1 >: B](key: A, value: B1): immutable.Map[A, B1] = updated(key, value).asInstanceOf[immutable.Map[A, B1]]
```

Vector is following the convention for 2.8.0. You may disagree with the convention, of course, but Vector should not be singled out for using updated for immutable updates.
