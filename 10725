So 5/6 of these can successfully be assigned to a byte:
```scala
    public static final byte z1  = 123;
    public static final short z2 = 123;
    public static final char z3  = 123;
    public static final int z4   = 123;
    public static final long z5  = 123;
    public static final byte z6  = -123;
```
Why stop at 5? Squeeze the long in too, that 123 is just as 123 as the other 123s.

It's funny to think that one could change a static final java **int** from 127 to 128, and this would break the scala code which makes use of it, and it would all be by design. I hope things keep getting weirder.
