Hum, that looks related indeed, and the comment suggests this is Hard (tm). However, IIUC, the linked backstory explains why the _type_ of the Block needs to hide away some members. But I don't think that explains why the actual _class_ itself (its implementation) needs to suddenly turn public members into private ones. It seems to me that there might be a relatively easy fix to that (compared to fixing the _type_ issue).

It is also worth mentioning that if the anonymous class does not have any expected type at all, then the members are kept public. For example rewriting `get()` above as:

{code:scala}
def get(): AnyRef = {
  val o = new { ... }
  o
}
{code}

allows all members to be public.
