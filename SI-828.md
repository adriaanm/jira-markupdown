the issue is:
 - The scala compiler reads the 1.5 java library, even when targetting 1.4
 - In 1.5, {{StringBuffer}} extends the private class {{AbstractStringBuilder}} (not visible in javadocs) whose append methods return an {{AbstractStringBuilder}}.
 - The append methods of {{StringBuffer}} use java's _covariant return types_, and return {{StringBuffer}}. This generates the bridge methods in {{StringBuffer}}, so there are two append methods.
 - The scala-compiler does not expect bridge methods in -target:jvm-1.4 mode

So this seems like it is a side-effect of Martin's fix for SI-789 in r14847.
The right solution is to replace {{classes.jar}} in {{Settings.bootclasspath}} with a 1.4 version when targetting 1.4. Then building the scala library for 1.4 works, I tested it.

Right now, it's a bit messy because the "-bootclasspath" option contains the java AND the scala library, it doesn't allow to override only the java library.

I would propose to split the bootclasspath into "-javabootcp" and "-scalabootcp" - but this involves a change to the compiler options (and therefore to the ant tasks, script runner, ...)

Gilles, what do you think?
