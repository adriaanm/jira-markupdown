Indeed, val definitions that don't bind any variables are actually explicitly speced. See SLS 4.1: "If p has no bound variables..."

There is much discussion of this issue at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-user/k57U6jt8Za0 

Surely this is a bug though:
{noformat}
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.RC4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> { val 1 = 2 }
scala.MatchError: 2 (of class java.lang.Integer)

scala> val 1 = 2

scala> 
{noformat}

No error there at the end, just "OK boss!"

Shall I open a separate ticket on it? Or shall we reopen this one?
