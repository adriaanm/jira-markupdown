=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===

Save this code as Fail.scala:
```scala
// Based on code at: http://daily-scala.blogspot.com/2010/04/creating-custom-traversable.html

import scala.collection._
import scala.collection.generic._
import scala.collection.mutable.{ Builder, ListBuffer }

class MyColl[A](seq : A*) extends Traversable[A]
                             with GenericTraversableTemplate[A, MyColl]
                             with TraversableLike[A, MyColl[A]] {
    override def companion = MyColl
    def foreach[U](f: A => U) = util.Random.shuffle(seq.toSeq).foreach(f)
}

object MyColl extends TraversableFactory[MyColl] {
    implicit def canBuildFrom[A]: CanBuildFrom[Coll, A, MyColl[A]] = new GenericCanBuildFrom[A]
    def newBuilder[A] = new ListBuffer[A] mapResult (x => new MyColl(x:_*))
}

object Fail {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
        val c = new MyColl(1, 2, 3)
        val o : MyColl[Long] = c map {_.toLong}
        println(o mkString "," )
    }
}

```

Then enter this on the command line:
```scala
fsc -shutdown
fsc Fail.scala
fsc Fail.scala
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
I think it should correctly compile both times.  (I could be convinced that it should fail both times, but it works with scalac, so I think the code is correct.)


=== What do you see instead? ===
The first time it compiles with no problem.

The second time it fails with this error:
```scala
/testing/Fail.scala:22: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Traversable[Long]
 required: MyColl[Long]
        val o : MyColl[Long] = c map {_.toLong}
                                 ^
one error found
```

=== Additional information ===
Deleting the class files in between fsc calls makes no difference.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: tested on 2.8.1-final and 2.9.0.r23886-b20110104020128 
  - Java: 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: OS X 10.6.5
Cannot reproduce with 2.8.1 or trunk.
```scala
fsc -shutdown
[Compile server exited]
[paulp@stem 4131]$$ fsc a.scala 
[paulp@stem 4131]$$ fsc a.scala 
[paulp@stem 4131]$$ fsc a.scala
