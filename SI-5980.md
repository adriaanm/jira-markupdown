The source code for `util.Try.apply` has a catch block

```scala
  catch {
    case e => Failure(e)
  }
```

which will soak up control exceptions.  `Failure.recover` and `Success.flatMap` have the same problem.  The catch block should be

```scala
  catch {
    case ct: control.ControlThrowable => throw ct
    case e => Failure(e)
  }
```

If you try to use a return or a break from within these methods, this bug will result in a `Failure` instead of the desired control flow.
  
The issue was only partly fixed: `Success.flatMap` is still (as of 2.10.M6 at least)

```scala
  def flatMap[U](f: T => Try[U]): Try[U] =
    try f(value)
    catch {
      case e: Throwable => Failure(e)
    }
```

which eats control exceptions.
