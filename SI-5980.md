The source code for {{util.Try.apply}} has a catch block

{code}
  catch {
    case e => Failure(e)
  }
{code}

which will soak up control exceptions.  {{Failure.recover}} and {{Success.flatMap}} have the same problem.  The catch block should be

{code}
  catch {
    case ct: control.ControlThrowable => throw ct
    case e => Failure(e)
  }
{code}

If you try to use a return or a break from within these methods, this bug will result in a {{Failure}} instead of the desired control flow.
  
The issue was only partly fixed: {{Success.flatMap}} is still (as of 2.10.M6 at least)

{code}
  def flatMap[U](f: T => Try[U]): Try[U] =
    try f(value)
    catch {
      case e: Throwable => Failure(e)
    }
{code}

which eats control exceptions.
