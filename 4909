```scala

S.scala:7: error: method f1 in class J cannot be accessed in test.J
  def g1(x: J) = x.f1()
                   ^
S.scala:8: error: method f2 in class J cannot be accessed in test.J
 Access to protected method f2 not permitted because
 enclosing class class S1 in package nest is not a subclass of 
 class J in package test where target is defined
  def g2(x: J) = x.f2()
