When converting string to numbers, the behaviour between natural numbers and floating points is different with regard to leading and trailing spaces:

{code:scala}
scala> " 1".toInt
  java.lang.NumberFormatException
scala > "1 ".toLong
  java.lang.NumberFormatException
scala> " 1 ".toFloat
  res3: Float = 1.0
scala> " 1 ".toDouble
  res4: Double = 1.0
{code}

The documentation is exactly the same in both cases even though the results are not: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.11.8/#scala.collection.immutable.WrappedString. Internally, Java's `parseInt/Long/Float/Double` are used, but perhaps it's a good idea to add a call to {{trim}} in the case of integer types. See source: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/99a82be91cbb85239f70508f6695c6b21fd3558c/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/StringLike.scala
I am happy to provide a fix for this, if required.

* Should the trim() code be added? Or documentation included explaining the behaviour?

On one hand, the behaviour seems inconsistent and the suggestion sounds reasonable.

On the other hand the behaviour is consistent with the documentation and semantics of the java7 methods.
- Double explicitly says "Leading and trailing whitespace characters in s are ignored"
 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#valueOf(java.lang.String)

 - Integer explicitly says the string "must all be decimal digits, except that the first .. may be '-'"
 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String,%20int)

OK I think its worth doing and I will have a crack at it.

After looking into the Java code, it seems reasonable to add the trim() and make the Scala double/int handling consistent.
It does not seem to add any major performance concerns. 
Anyone relying on the java behaviour (not documented in scala) can always call the java parseInt.

Notes from java code:
- First thing the java.lang.Double.parseDouble does is trim() on the string, then (and which throws NPE on null), and then goes into the parsing logic.

- First thing the java.lang.Integer.parseInt does is look check for null (and instead throws NumberFormatException: null) and then goes into the parsing logic.
