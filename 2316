I think the problem is in `adaptMember` in erasure:
```scala
        case Select(qual, name) if (name != nme.CONSTRUCTOR) =>
[...]
            } else if (!(qual1.isInstanceOf[Super] || (qual1.tpe.typeSymbol isSubClass tree.symbol.owner))) {
              assert(tree.symbol.owner != ArrayClass)
-              qual1 = cast(qual1, tree.symbol.owner.tpe)
+              qual1 = cast(qual1, tree.symbol.owner.tpe.normalize) // SI-2331
            }
-            treeCopy.Select(tree, qual1, name)
+           treeCopy.Select(tree, qual1, name) setSymbol NoSymbol // SI-2331: force re-typecheck as name may now refer to a different symbol
```
