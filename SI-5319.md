the following code shows that changes made to the array returned by seq.toArray show up in the stream (lazily?) created by seq.toStream 

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val seq: Seq[Int] = Array(1,2,3)
seq: Seq[Int] = WrappedArray(1, 2, 3)

scala> val immutable = seq.toStream
immutable: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> val array = seq.toArray
array: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)

scala> array(0)=333;array(1)=666;array(2)=999

scala> immutable.foreach(println)
1
666
999
```

if you force the stream before seq.toArray, the sharing goes away 

```scala
scala> seq.toStream
res6: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> res6 foreach println
1
2
3

scala> seq.toArray
res8: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)

scala> res8(1) = 10

scala> res6 foreach println
1
2
3
```
I consider this behavior correct too. The resulting Stream **is** immutable, but what elements it contains depends on when they are evaluated. It would be meaningless for Stream to act in any other way -- you might as well convert it into a List.
Stream is a caching generator of values, and it works exactly like that:

```scala
scala> val a = Array(1, 2, 3)
a: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)

scala> val b = a.toStream
b: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> a(1) = 200; a(2) = 300

scala> b.toList
res1: List[Int] = List(1, 200, 300)

scala> a(1) = 2000; a(2) = 3000

scala> b.toList
res3: List[Int] = List(1, 200, 300)
```

Once the value has been generated, it cannot be changed. Before it has been generated, it is unknown. If toStream were to copy the whole collection, then it would not be acting like a Stream, but like a List.
The value is generated when necessary. array.toList does not have the same behavior because it is a strict collection, while Stream is non-strict. 

Non-strictness combines poorly with mutability, as this clearly shows. However, the solution is **not** to make a non-strict collection strict, but, rather, to point to people that non-strictness is difficult to reason about in the presence of mutability, and, therefore, that they should avoid combining both.
