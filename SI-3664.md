When explicitly defining the companion object of a case class, the compiler does not add a `FunctionN` parent and does not override `toString`.

working as expected:

```scala
scala> object u { case class C(x: Int) }
defined module u

scala> u.C
res1: u.C.type = C

scala> val f: Int => u.C = u.C
f: (Int) => u.C = C

scala> 

```


unexpected:
```scala
scala> object t { object C; case class C(x: Int) }
defined module t

scala> t.C
res0: t.C.type = t$$C$$@5e58a983

scala> val f: Int => t.C = t.C
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : t.C.type (with underlying type object t.C)
 required: (Int) => t.C
       val f: Int => t.C = t.C
                             ^
```
What's the status on this?

This one is annoying for me when trying to use the new "JSON Inception" coming in playframework 2.1 (http://mandubian.com/2012/11/11/JSON-inception/).

Consider this using play 2.1-RC1 and scala 2.10.0-RC1:

```
import play.api.libs.json._
import play.api.libs.functional.syntax._

case class ThisIsOk(id: String)

case class ThisIsNotOk(id: String)

object ThisIsNotOk {
  val something = 2
}

case class ThisBecomesOk(id: String)

object ThisBecomesOk extends (String => ThisBecomesOk) {
  val something = 2
}

object Test {
  val compilesFine = Json.format[ThisIsOk]

/*
Compilation error:
[error]  found   : ThisIsNotOk.type
[error]  required: String => ThisIsNotOk
[error]     val doesNotCompile = Json.format[ThisIsNotOk]
*/
  val doesNotCompile = Json.format[ThisIsNotOk]

  val compilesFineButIsAPain = Json.format[ThisBecomesOk]
}
```
Yea, this is one of those "odd Scala bugs" that I have to explain to newcomers all the time. We have a lot of code that was written before switching to Play Json, and a lot of places just passed the case class instead of the lambda'd apply method. The newcomer will add a companion object to create the Json Format and all of a sudden get compile errors about companion object singleton types not extending blah blah blah. It's definitely unexpected.

I notice that a lot of people I work with don't really know the difference between `f(X(_, _))` or `f(X *)` or `f(X.apply *)` or `f(X.apply)` or `f(X)` and certainly don't understand singleton types. Its a very subtle and confusing area already and this bug just adds to the exceptional cases. It would be nice to see some consistency here. Either case class companion objects should be functions or they shouldn't. The fact that the true behavior is a surprise seems un Scala-like considering much of the language just does the right thing when mixing a lot of orthogonal features.
Heiko, I agree, but you can work around it by adding `extends ` **function type** to the `object`.
I just stumbled over this starting with Slick, where this is also referenced in the docs: http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.0-M2/schemas.html#mapped-tables together with #4808

It would be cool to see this fixed for a better "just works out-of-the-box" feeling.
