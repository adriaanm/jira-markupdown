Scaladoc will show an abbreviated version of the page it shows for package objects. It doesn't display the source link, linear supertypes, or the filters for ordering and inherited. All these things are valid -- consider scala.sys.process, which extends a trait, for one example.
Simple test case:

{code:title=test/traits.scala}
package test
trait A { def hi = "hello" }
trait B { def bye = "bye!" }
```scala

{code:title=test/package.scala}
package object test extends A with B {
  override def hi = "good morning!"
  override def bye = "good bye!"
  protected def thank = "thank you!"
}
```

The above modification will fix

 * linear supertypes
 * the filters for ordering and inherited.

but there is no source link yet.
