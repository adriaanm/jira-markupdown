I just made a somewhat discovery when debugging an infinite loop in a place I didn't expect.  So I had code like this:
{code}
def foo(s: Traversable[Char]) = foo(s.toSet)
def foo(s: Set[Char]) = // do some stuff and return a result
{code}
Can you spot the infinite loop?

The type of the parameter in the second version of foo is scala.collection.immutable.Set, which coming out of Predef.  The return type of Traverable.toSet is scala.collection.Set.  A scala.collection.Set is a Traversable but not a scala.immutable.Set, and thus the first foo keeps on invoking itself.

I discovered what was wrong while playing on the console and receiving a confusing error message:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18383-b20090724020219 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.5.0_19).

Type :help for more information.

scala> val str = "thhheessse are my charrrssss"
str: java.lang.String = thhheessse are my charrrssss

scala> str.toSet
res0: scala.collection.Set[Char] = Set(e, s, y, t, a, m,  , h, r, c)

scala> val set: Set[Char] = str.toSet
<console>:5: error: polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;

       val set: Set[Char] = str.toSet
                                ^

scala> 
{code}
So I dig into the source and discover that Set out of Predef and the return type of toSet are different.

I think they should both be scala.collection.immutable.Set, but could see an argument for making the scala.collection.Set.  What's really confusing is having them be different.
