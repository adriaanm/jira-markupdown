scala> class Foo(val a: Int) extends AnyVal { def foo = { {case x => x}: PartialFunction[Int, Int]; () }}
<console>:7: error: implementation restriction: nested class is not allowed in value class
This restriction is planned to be removed in subsequent releases.
       class Foo(val a: Int) extends AnyVal { def foo = { {case x => x}: PartialFunction[Int, Int]; () }}{code}
I'm trying to remember exactly why the restriction exists (5d9cde105e); I suspect it is because we can't define an $outer pointer. But I don't think that is relevant for this case.

{code}
class Foo extends AnyVal {
  def foo = () => 0 // okay
  def bar = {case x => x} : PartialFunction[Int, Int] // should also be okay IMO
}
{code}
