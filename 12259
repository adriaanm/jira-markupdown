_> There's a SO question_

From the [relevant answer|http://stackoverflow.com/a/18109794]: "Using -Xlog-implicits -Yinfer-debug shows the difference between {{reduce(math.max)}}, where overload resolution happens first, and the version where the param type is solved for first"

If the order of evaluation (of overload resolution vs. type inference) can indeed be different, that would probably explain the above differences in behaviour, too.

Do we know whether there's anything in the spec that stipulates in which order these two operations should happen, or whether this is (intentionally or otherwise) left open for the compiler to decide?
