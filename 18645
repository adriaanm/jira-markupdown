The documentation for scala.collections.JavaConverters has a spelling mistake. This line
```
The following conversions also are supported, but the direction Scala to Java is done {color:red}my{color} a more specifically named method: asJavaCollection, asJavaEnumeration, asJavaDictionary.
```

Should be
```
The following conversions also are supported, but the direction Scala to Java is done {color:red}by{color} a more specifically named method: asJavaCollection, asJavaEnumeration, asJavaDictionary.
```
