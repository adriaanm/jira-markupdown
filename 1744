I have looked into this problem in more depth, it appears that the failure point occurs at `org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.SourceElementParser.parseCompilationUnit(...)` line 899:

`parsedUnit = parse(unit, compilationUnitResult);`

parse is a call to a java-centric document parser, so it, of course, is going to fail on calls with scala documents. 

Maybe an aspect can be used to make a pointcut somewhere around that execution path and a call to the scala parser could be made instead.
