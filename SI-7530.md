Scala Migrations [1] has the following snippet in Migration.scala [2]

{code}
  private def indexNameFor(tableName: String,
                           columnNames: Array[String],
                           options: IndexOption*): (String, List[IndexOption]) = {
  ...
  }

  final def addIndex(tableName: String,
                     columnNames: Array[String],
                     options: IndexOption*) {
    if (columnNames.isEmpty) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Adding an index requires at " +
        "least one column name.")
    }

    var (name, opts) = indexNameFor(tableName, columnNames, options: _*)

    var unique = false
    for (opt @ Unique <- opts) {
      opts = opts filter { _ ne opt }
      unique = true
    }
{code}

2.11.0 gives the following warning:

{code}
[warn] /var/lib/jenkins/tomcat7/jenkins/jobs/scala-migrations-gerrit/workspace/src/main/scala/com/imageworks/migration/Migration.scala:357: local var name in method addIndex is never set - it could be a val
[warn]     var (name, opts) = indexNameFor(tableName, columnNames, options: _*)
[warn]          ^
{code}

Since `opts` is modified, I cannot make the `var` a `val` without other changes, such as copying `opts` to `os` and then modifying that.

I don't know if this counts as a real bug, since it is correct, but the fix is more than what the warning suggests.  Maybe the warning text just needs to be tweaked.

Similarly:

{code}
% scala-hash v2.11.0-M3 -Xlint

scala> {var x, y = 0 ; (); y; x = 2 }
<console>:8: warning: local var y in value res1 is never set - it could be a val
              {var x, y = 0 ; (); y; x = 2 }
                      ^
{code}

It's actually near impossible to give discriminating error messages under the current compiler architecture as the parser eliminates all traces of the original shape of the assignment long before these warnings kick in. Maybe the parser could attach a tree annotation so they remember something more.
