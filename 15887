I would like to be able to use the symbol � (logical NOT) as a unary prefix (as per the language spec 6.12.1, only +,-,! and ~ are allowed). The following should be legal:

{code}
implicit def BooleanW(b : Boolean) = new {
  def � = !b
  def ∧(c : Boolean) = b && c
  def ∨(c : Boolean) = b || c
}
{code}

This would, in turn, let me write code like:
{code}
    val a = true
    val b = a ∨ �a
{code}
