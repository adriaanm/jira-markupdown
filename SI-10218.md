I can't imagine this is a new issue but I can't find an old one, so.

Please make the specification searchable (available as a single page as a quick fix?) or, better, figure out how to make a proper index. The language is complex enough that questions about its behavior come up a lot for users, and it's often quite hard to find the relevant section in the spec. For example, I had a question last night about import priority and found it in the introduction to identifiers, names and scopes in the 2.9 spec PDF and it happens to still be there (but not in the section on import statements, which I found via the TOC, which is where I looked first).
