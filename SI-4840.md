This is with r25381, which looked good until I tried using it.  It's cruising along and then the optimizer just spews a bunch of state, no clear indication of the problem given.  Whee.

[Edit: painstakingly minimized.]

{code}
class Crashy {
  def g(): Option[Any] = None
  
  def crashy() = {
    for (_ <- g()) {
      (null: Any) match {
        case Some(_) => 5
        case None    => sys.error("")
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}

def crashy(): Unit {
locals: variable par11, variable $inlThis1, variable v11, variable boxed11, variable $inlThis2, variable $retVal1, variable _1, variable temp11, variable eqEqTemp$11, variable $inlThis3, variable $retVal2

It blows up with trunk too.  This is a good sign that we need to be building akka nightlies with trunk nightlies.

This is, if not exactly fixed, at least worked around in r25383.
