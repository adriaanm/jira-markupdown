[scalacfork] /home/jordi/workspace/scala/src/library/scala/xml/MetaData.scala:30: error: could not optimize @tailrec annotated method concatenate: it is neither private nor final so can be overridden
[scalacfork]   def concatenate(attribs: MetaData, new_tail: MetaData): MetaData =
[scalacfork]       ^
[scalacfork] one error found
{code}

The compiler is correct: -Xexperimental also sets overrideObjects -- so this method is effectively overridable. The solution has to be in MetaData.scala.

Three possible solutions:
 # Remove @tailrec (could cause performance degradation)
 # Make the method final (would effectively change API, although only in the experimental case)
 # Apply this patch: {code}
