When running the following code, the first Ok == Ok check is sometimes false (maybe 3 out of 10), the following ones are true as expected.

{code:java}
package bug

import collection.mutable.ListBuffer
import actors.{TIMEOUT, Actor}

class Work {

  sealed trait Result
  case object Ok extends Result

  val timer = new Actor {
    private var results = new ListBuffer[Result]

    def act() {
      loop {
        react {
          case r: Result =>
            results += r
          case 'tick =>
            println(results(0)+", "+results(1))
            println("compare: "+(results(0) == results(1)))
            results.clear()
          case 'stop =>
            exit()
        }
      }
    }
  }

  class CalcActor(id: Int) extends Actor {
    def act(): Unit = {
      timer ! Ok
      react { case x => reply(x); exit() }
    }
  }

  def doit() {
    timer.start()
    for (i <- 1 to 5) {
      val actors = for (i <- 1 to 2) yield new CalcActor(i).start()
      actors foreach { _ !? 'stop }
      timer ! 'tick
    }
    timer ! 'stop
  }

}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    new Work().doit()
  }
}
{code}

Scala 2.9.1 does not seem to reproduce this behavior, however I post it since I couldn't find a clearly related issue, and since I don't know if the bug is fixed in 2.9.1 or just hidden by a changed timing condition.

Notes 
 * while my 2.8.1 does not reproduce SI-4565, if I move the Response trait and Ok to the top-level out of Work class, everything seems to be fine
 * running the CalcActors serially also fixes the problem
