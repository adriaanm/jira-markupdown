The following code:
{code}
import java.util.concurrent._

class Rule {
  def serializedConfig (): ConcurrentMap[java.io.Serializable, java.io.Serializable] = null
  def id(): String = "some id"
}

object rule {
  val rule = new Rule
}

object somewhereElse {
  rule.serializedConfig.put ("abc", "foo bar")
  rule.id + "123"
}
{code}
gives me the following errors: [[BR]]
on string 13: [[BR]]
"value serializedConfig is not a member of object rule" [[BR]]
on string 14: [[BR]]
"value id is not a member of object rule". [[BR]]

This is totally weird. [[BR]]

Your code is incorrect, you are trying to access methods in Rule while referencing rule. Change object somewhereElse to the following and it will work:

{code}
object somewhereElse {
  rule.rule.serializedConfig.put ("abc", "foo bar")
  rule.rule.id + "123"
}
{code}
