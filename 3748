Thank you for your demonstration of the value of my having unified the Traversable and Iterator implementations under TraversableOnce.  (In other words this is already fixed, although I didn't know it was there.)

BTW your implementation (like the one in trunk before) is not tail recursive and would easily blow the stack:
{code}
scala> (1 to 10000).iterator reduceRight (_ - _)
java.lang.StackOverflowError
	at scala.collection.immutable.Range.apply(Range.scala:29)
	at scala.collection.IndexedSeqLike$$Elements.next(IndexedSeqLike.scala:54)
{code}
No problem anymore:
{code}
scala> (1 to 1000000).iterator reduceRight (_ - _)
res1: Int = -500000
{code}
