IMO the general restriction to forbid any types with '$$' in the Scala syntax is reasonable (although, failing with only an assertion isn't). What you experienced here, can only happen to *you*, because you - as a developer of the interpreter - are the only one who has access to the mighty "eval". And it's only then, that implementation details of the compiler output can feed back into the compiler, isn't it?
