I agree that special-casing Enumeration in the compiler is unlikely to happen, but it's interesting to think about how this kind of thing **could** be done in a general way.

CODE SKETCH, DO NOT COMPILE
```scala
case class sealed(value: Seq[_ <: Enumeration#Value] extends Annotation

object Foo extends Enumeration {
  @sealed(List(Foo1,Foo2)) // Probably doable, but smelly repetition
  @sealed(values)          // Too bad values is a def, not a stable identifier
  case class FooValue(i: Int, s: String, d: Double) extends Value(i, s)

  type Foo = FooValue

  val Foo1 = Foo(1,"One",1.0)
  val Foo2 = Foo(2,"Two",2.0)
}
```
