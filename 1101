Well, it's a defect in the sense that the compiler becomes unusable for compiling certain valid Scala code. It's not a defect in the sense that it violates the language specification.

The example is really simple and no type inference is needed, the type path is straight forward to evaluate. So I was hoping it would just require an easy optimization fix in the type checker, but if it's, like you say (and I doubt), an inherent property of the type checking algorithm that the time to type check code like this grows exponentially (or similar), then, as you say, it would require a much larger modification.
