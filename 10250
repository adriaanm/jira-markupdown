Yes, as I said in the ticket, the scaladoc code interprets any output to stderr as a failure (maybe a bit to aggressive)

In the meantime you can place this as your dot command first in the path to filter out the warnings.

{code:shell}
#!/bin/bash
/usr/local/bin/dot "$@" 2> >( grep -v "CoreText performance note:" >&2 )
{code}
