We're using a legacy infrastructure for data conversion based on the Dozer project, for which we wrote some scala-specific adapters. Everything works properly except for fields that are generic on scala.Int, such as Option[Int] or List[Int]. After some research it appears that the Java reflection system fails to discover the type argument for Option[Int], whereas it succeeds in doing so for Option[String]. 

Please see the attached file which reproduces the issue.
First, can you enumerate the searches you issued before opening this ticket, the results of which must have omitted the existing ones.  I need this information to improve the search facility, because I lose far too much time to duplicate, not-a-bug, and documented-wontfix tickets.

I searched for "object type parameter primitive" and the #1 hit was SI-4403 which is linked to SI-4214 which iirc is the main relevant ticket here.
I see the relation to SI-4403, although the comment by [~extempore] seems to indicate that there's no intention to fix this issue, which is a problem, as I see it, since the compiler generates invalid bytecode.

SI-4214 seems to have been resolved if you look at the comment from the original reporter, but nowhere do I see a reference to a solution that resolves the primitive generic type issue.

I've linked this issue to the "metabug" SI-4912, I hope to see a fix soon, and I would love to hear from [~extempore] why there's not much that can be done about it.
