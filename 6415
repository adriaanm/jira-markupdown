(extempore in [r25511|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25511]) Removing the code which has been deprecated since 2.8.0. Contributed by
Simon Ochsenreither, although deleting code is such fun one hesitates to
call it a contribution. Still, we will. Closes scala/bug#4860, no review.
