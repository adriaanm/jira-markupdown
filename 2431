I don't think 2429B has anything to do with the pattern matcher.  The synthetic e$$1 which is crashing it doesn't make its first appearance until lambdalifter, right here:
{code}
    def item(text: Bug2429B#TSeq): Bug2429B#TSeq = Bug2429B.this.TSeq.fromSeq(immutable.this.Nil.map({
      (new anonymous class $$anonfun$$item$$1(e$$1): Function1)
    }, immutable.this.List.builderFactory()).$$asInstanceOf[Seq]());
{code}
