The exceptions are being thrown in the face of an endless variety of bad signatures.  I think they all have the same form where the inner class is dotted after some overcomplicated type, but possibly not.  Some examples:
{code}
signature: (Lscala/BufferedIterator$$PutBack<TA;>.$$anonfun$$flushFrom$$1;)V
signature: (Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>;TA;TB;Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Tree<TB;>;Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Tree<TB;>;)V
signature: (Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.NonEmpty<TB;>;)V
signature: (Lscala/collection/jcl/MutableIterable<TA;>.$$anonfun$$retainAll$$1;)V
{code}
