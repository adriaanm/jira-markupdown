Ah, I see. OK, I concur. (and if you decide to close as wontfix, I'd be fine with that too now, actually)

Also, I see now I was mistaken about the behavior of javac —�I think I have had this wrong in my head for 10 years. if you don't pass -g at all to javac, "By default, only line number and source file information is generated." Passing -g by itself gives you everything, which is more than the default; to get no debugging info at all, you must say -g:none. "It isn't a no-op in javac" is actually correct, but not for the reason I thought.
