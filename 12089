But, the following example works, as I would've expected:
```java
$scala
Welcome to Scala 2.12.0-M3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_51).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> sealed trait Parent
defined trait Parent

scala> case object Boy extends Parent
defined object Boy

scala> case object Girl extends Parent
defined object Girl

scala> case object Zippity 
defined object Zippity

scala> trait HasGirl { val x: Girl.type }
defined trait HasGirl

scala> case class Thing(x: Zippity.type) extends HasGirl
<console>:15: error: overriding value x in trait HasGirl of type Girl.type;
 value x has incompatible type
       case class Thing(x: Zippity.type) extends HasGirl
                        ^
```

Perhaps this example will help with the issue's resolution?
