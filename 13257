With compiler built from r14440, it is not possible to parse certain Java 1.5 classfiles. Here is a testcase:

*!HarderToParse.java*
```scala
public class HarderToParse<A> {
    class InnerClass {
	// Cannot parse method signature: "()TA;"
	public A method() { return null; }
    }
}
```

*!ForceParse.scala*
```scala
object ForceParse extends HarderToParse[AnyRef] {
  // Force import of HarderToParse<A>.InnerClass,
  // which has confusing method signature.
  var field: InnerClass = null
}
```

The compiler error message is:
```scala
error: error while loading HarderToParse$$InnerClass, class file 'brokenclass/classes/HarderToParse$$InnerClass.class' is broken
(key not found: A)
one error found
```

I assume it's getting confused by the type *A*, which is a type parameter of the parent class.

The compiler log, including stack trace, is attached.

This error was found in the wild in the constructor of [http://mina.apache.org MINA's] !AbstractPollingIoConnector.!ConnectionRequest class. Another error parsing a MINA classfile was reported in scala/bug#489.
