The version of the installer previously in use was rather old; a much more recent version of the installer has been included in our upcoming 2.8 distribution,and that should address these issues.

In particular, the IzPack installer is really designed for private user installations, rather than by root. The default installation directory on *nix used to be /usr/local for every user, but that was changed in a subsequent release of the IzPack installer so that non-administrators are presented with a local default.
