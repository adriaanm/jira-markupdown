```scala
import scala.util.Sorting._

val a = Array("a", "c", "b")

println(a.toList)
stableSort(a: Seq[String])
println(a.toList)
stableSort(a)
println(a.toList)
```

outputs:

```scala
List(a, c, b)
List(a, c, b)
List(a, b, c)
```

I expect 

```scala
stableSort(a: Seq[String])
```

and 

```scala
stableSort(a)
```

to produce same result. However, first returns sorted collection, second sorts in place. I think, stableSort(Array) should be renamed to stableSortInPlace(Array).
This would be in line with the new collections overall guideline that methods which mutate a collection do not share the name with methods which do not mutate a collection. This could be deprecated under its present name, and the new name added, much like `+` for mutable collections.
In 2.9.0.r24324-b20110222020042

```scala
import scala.util.Sorting._

val a = Array("a", "c", "b")

println(a.toList)
stableSort(a: Seq[String])
println(a.toList)
stableSort(a)
println(a.toList)
```

outputs:

```scala
List(a, c, b)
List(a, b, c)
List(a, b, c)
```

This means that both sort in-place now.

Can this considered to be fixed?
