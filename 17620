`@throws` tags do not appear to create clickable links to the named exception classes.

For example, consider this code snippet:
```scala
package dummy

/** Dodgy exception.
  *
  * Thrown if something dodgy happens.
  */

class DodgyException extends Exception ("Something dodgy happened")

/** Some dodgy object.
  */

object Dodgy {

/** Some dodgy function.
  *
  * @throws dummy.DodgyException if something dodgy happens.
  */

  def someDodgyFunction (): Unit = {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Will result in the following Scaladoc snippet (approximate appearance):
```
def someDodgyFunction(): Unit
    Some dodgy function
    Exceptions thrown   dummy.DodgyException
                        if something dodgy happens
```

Note the that `dummy.DodgyException` is not a link!

I also tried, by analogy to the `@see` tag, the following:
```scala
package dummy

/** Dodgy exception.
  *
  * Thrown if something dodgy happens.
  */

class DodgyException extends Exception ("Something dodgy happened")

/** Some dodgy object.
  */

object Dodgy {

/** Some dodgy function.
  *
  * @throws [[dummy.DodgyException]] if something dodgy happens.
  */

  def someDodgyFunction (): Unit = {
    // ...
  }
}
```

using the link syntax around the exception name.  However, this produces the following (approximate)output:
```
def someDodgyFunction(): Unit
    Some dodgy function.
    Exceptions thrown   [[dummy.DodgyException]]
                        if something dodgy happens
```

In this case, note that the double square brackets are retained.

For an example in the Scala API docs, refer to: [scala.Option.get](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option).

Is this correct behavior?
