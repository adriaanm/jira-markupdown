Relatedly, I've found that the way that AsSeenFrom discards (most) annotations is the root cause of scala/bug#8071. I asked for the history of this, and Martin said that originally no annotations where preserved through typemaps. When CPS needed it, rather than passing them all through, only the CPS related annotation was passed through. Why not pass them all? He wasn't sure, but a plausible theory was it was an attempt at a minimal change to solve the problem at hand.

I'm going to try to pass through all annotations to see if anything breaks or gets slower. Hopefully that change will also sort out this ticket.
