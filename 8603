Thanks for the report, Eugene, and the detailed investigation, Jason.
It seems the simplest fix is to just not do rewrites when we have a dynamic polytype:
```scala
             def applyMeth = member(adaptToName(tree, nme.apply), nme.apply)
-            dyna.acceptsApplyDynamic(tree.tpe) || (
+            (dyna.acceptsApplyDynamic(tree.tpe) && !tree.tpe.isInstanceOf[PolyType]) || (
```

What do you think, Jason? Also, should I send a pull request against 2.10.0-wip or 2.10.x?

Thanks.
