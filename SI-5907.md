I believe the following code is wrong:

{code}
case class C(i: Int)(implicit m: Int) { def inc = copy(i = i+1) } 
>defined class C

implicit val n = 1
>n: Int = 1

scala> C(0)
res1: C = C(0)

scala> res1.inc
res2: Int => C = <function1>
{code}

res2 should be a new instance of `C`
I hadn't really thought about implicits when this was dreamed up, but now it seems like a big problem.  There's just no way to see this as anything but a regression:
{code}
scala> case class Foo[T: Ordering](x: T)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(5)
res0: Foo[Int] = Foo(5)

scala> res0.copy(x = 10)
res1: Ordering[Int] => Foo[Int] = <function1>
{code}

Here's another reason, my email to scala-internals about SI-5929.

Oh, the interesting things one learns trying to compile scalatest against
the right version of scalacheck.  It didn't compile, actually, which led
me to this little bundle of badness.

  case class Foo(x: Int)(implicit y: Foo) { }
  def f(args: List[Foo]) = if (false) args map (_.copy()) else args

What return type is to be inferred for f? In m3 it is List[Foo].  In m4
it is List[Object], because of https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5907 .

In scalatest, the affected method is

  private def getArgsWithSpecifiedNames(argNames: Option[List[String]], scalaCheckArgs: Prop.Args) = {
    if (argNames.isDefined) {
      // length of scalaCheckArgs should equal length of argNames
      val zipped = argNames.get zip scalaCheckArgs
      zipped map { case (argName, arg) => arg.copy(label = argName) }
    }
    else
      scalaCheckArgs
  }
{noformat}

i'll have a look

This isn't limited to just implicits; the regression affects any case class with more than one parameter list:

{code}
case class Sad(i: Int)(j: Int)
Sad(0)(0).copy()()
{code}

In 2.9, this yielded another Sad(0)(0). In 2.10.0-M4, it's {{error: not enough arguments for method apply}}, thanks to the curried Function1 not having a default argument.
Injecting my comment from the scala-internals thread because it seems plausibly among the least bad ways to go from here.

Hmm, maybe we should let people declare the copy signature they want, and accommodate it if possible.

case class C(x: Int)(y: Int)(implicit z: Int) {
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int = y): C  // this way z is fixed at construction, and gets a field
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int = y)(implicit z: Int = z): C // this way z is an optional implicit, and gets a field
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int = y)(implicit z: Int): C // this way z is a mandatory implicit, no field
  def copy(x: Int = x)(y: Int)(implicit z: Int): C // and this way neither y nor z gets a field
}
{noformat}
