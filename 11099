@cvogt The fix version is 2.12.0-M1. 2.11.everything is going to be affected because, as explained above, it *cannot* be fixed unless we either break binary compatibility or introduce major performance penalties on other collections.

And yes, of course, the offending line in the bug report will go in a test.
