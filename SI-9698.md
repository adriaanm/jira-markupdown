A Google for *scala nightlies api docs* lists this old document set,

   Scala Standard Library 2.11.0-20140303-150720 ...
   http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/library/#package

Removing this would help declutter search results. There are no obvious clues when browsing the docs that they are not the current nightlies.
An example of how old documentation is misleading users

Thank you so much. Google was giving scala-lang.org/api/2.5.0/scala/collection/immutable/Queue.html as a second result for "scala queue immutable". I wasn't so careful and I did not notice that it was for version 2.5. I overestimated the power of google search engine :) â€“ Alexis Clarembeau 19 hours ago
