Thanks for discussing this at the meeting.  I'm confused by the wontfix resolution, though, because this ticket has two parts, one is a enhancement and the other is a defect.

The enhancement under discussion involves changing Traversable's toString, and it's fine that the answer there is wontfix, because it will be tricky for all the reasons outlined above and presumably for other reasons discussed at the meeting.

But the main reason for this ticket is that the way the REPL deals with Traversables is broken.  Currently, the REPL uses ScalaRunTime.stringOf, which selectively avoids calling toString for anything that extends Traversable.  So scala's interpreter loop ignores scala's official mechanism for turning objects into strings. This just has to be considered a defect, no?
