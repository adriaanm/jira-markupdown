Correction:[[BR]]
"My proposal is to extend the language to allow the empty-parens syntax for a field
in a value-expression, if the name of the field is declared with empty-parens in its enclosing type lineairization.[[BR]]
So d.a() would compile in the example above.[[BR]]
This seems a clean, simple and correct solution to such cases.[[BR]]
This construct would be analogue to parameterless methods being invoked using empty-parens syntax."
