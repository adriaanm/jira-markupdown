See attachments planets3.scala and planets5.scala

The only difference is that planets3.scala has runtime casting:
implicit def valueToPlanetVal(x: Value) = x.asInstanceOf[Val]

and planets5.scala an explicit return type:
implicit def valueToPlanetVal(x: Value) : Val = x

Both compile without errors.
planets3.scala is running well.

planets5.scala hangs and never exutes the last line and without an error message:
println("Mars mass: " + Planet.withName("Mars").mass + " kg")
Here is a simplified example of the looping implicit:
{noformat}class A
class B(val name: String) extends A
implicit def aToB(a: A): B = { println("aToB"); a }

println((new A).name)
// leads to infinite loop on implicit aToB()
{noformat}

Is this a programmer error, or should the typechecker make sure an implicit shouldn't be applicable within its own definition?

On second thought, it should fail completely. It's entirely nonsensical since {{a}} should never become a {{B}}, except the implicit is of a different opinion, hehe.
