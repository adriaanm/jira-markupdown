I changed my Kiama library's sbt build scalaVersion from 2.10.0 to 2.10.1-RC1 and now when I compile I get a stack overflow in the typer. All was fine with 2.10.0.

I'm still narrowing the code down but I wanted to report it quickly since this is an RC.

The attached file Rewriter.scala contains the childSeq method in which the crash occurs (line 438). I've attached the crash report and the top of the stack trace is:

I think it's a bug if x.dealias eq x on an AliasTypeRef; you shouldn't have to check at every call site that calling dealias on an alias makes progress. Which is not to say we should not play defense when necessary. But we should not be creating alias cycles.

This line suggests that normalize should indeed be called, and it also doesn't look at all sensible to me that super.dealias when the condition is hit (which is not often, apparently.) By inspection, it looks like it will only mask bugs.
{code}
    override def dealias    = if (typeParamsMatchArgs) betaReduce.dealias else super.dealias
{code}
The super.dealias path is hit when compiling the library 6 times total, generally going through either typedTypeConstructor or typedHigherKindedType. For instance, the line containing GenPolyType below.
{code}
        val args1 = if (sameLength(args, tparams)) {
          //@M: in case TypeApply we can't check the kind-arities of the type arguments,
          // as we don't know which alternative to choose... here we do
          map2Conserve(args, tparams) {
            //@M! the polytype denotes the expected kind
            (arg, tparam) => typedHigherKindedType(arg, mode, GenPolyType(tparam.typeParams, AnyClass.tpe))
          }
        } else // @M: there's probably something wrong when args.length != tparams.length... (triggered by bug #320)
         // Martin, I'm using fake trees, because, if you use args or arg.map(typedType),
         // inferPolyAlternatives loops...  -- I have no idea why :-(
         // ...actually this was looping anyway, see bug #278.
          return TypedApplyWrongNumberOfTpeParametersError(fun, fun)
{code}
One of those old beloved comments, "there's probably something wrong when args.length != tparams.length", yeah. Notice the usage of Any, which is kind-polymorphic, a code phrase which means "there will be bugs" in the mother tongue. We shouldn't have to work so hard to prevent type constructors which are being checked for well-kindedness from being confused with applied types and/or types undergoing other checks like bounds conformance. Aka explicit kinds.
Here's a test case extracted from Kiama:

{code}
type T = Any
boom(???): Option[T] // SOE
def boom[CC[U]](t : CC[T]): Option[CC[T]] = None

// okay
foo(???): Option[Any]
def foo[CC[U]](t : CC[Any]): Option[CC[Any]] = None
{code}

Is there an in-flight patch for this? If not I can submit one.
Thanks all for tracking this one down, particularly Jason for narrowing the test case.

I'm curious the fix version is now Scala 2.11.0-M2. Since this is a regression from 2.10.0 I was hoping to see a fix in 2.10.1.

{{Any}} is a bit of a red herring there, the for type checking higher kinded types, expected kind is sneakily encoded an expected type (ie {{pt}}). In that encoding, the return type is unused.

What happens is that we have a higher kinded type ref encoded (again) as an {{AliasTypeRef}} without args. This can't be dealiased, the only way to reveal anything further is via {{etaExpand}} (which is behind {{normalize}} for these.

For example:

{code}
type L[X] = Any
// <L>.dealias eq <L>
// <L>.etaExpand == <[X]Any>
{code}

I'm not sure what conclusions to draw from all of this. Maybe a split `AliasTypeRef` into a HK and regular version?

I'm running a test now to see with:

{code}
    final def typeParamsMatchArgs  = if (typeParamsMatchArgs0) true
                                     else if (isHigherKinded && args.isEmpty) false
                                     else { debugwarn(s"$this.typeParamsMatchArgs = false for non-higher-kinded type"); false}
{code}

to see if there are any ground type refs that that get into this spot.
