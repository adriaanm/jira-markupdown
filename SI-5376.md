i was experimenting with implicits trying to figure out exactly which implicit is picked when, and there was a problem which i cannot explain other than "it's not a feature, it's a bug!"

Correct1:
i import 2 conversions which are ambigous, compiler complains, everything ok.

Bug1: 
Same situation, both conversions are imported - but the compiler doesn't complain. 

see the whole thread for more details:

It would be helpful if you would not include large amounts of extraneous detail, and when attempting to contrast behavior of two pieces of code, if they did not appear to be written for two different bug reports.  What are you are trying to report is presumably captured in the following.
```scala

object Test {
  object O1 { implicit def f(s: String): Int = 1 }
  object O2 { implicit def f(s: String): Int = 2 }
  object O3 { implicit def f1(s: String): Int = 3 }
  object O4 { implicit def f2(s: String): Int = 4 }
  
  // Import two implicits with the same name in the same scope.
  def m1 = {
    import O1._
    import O2._

    // Implicit usage compiles.
    "a": Int
    // Explicit call to f fails.
    f("a")
    // ./c.scala:9: error: reference to f is ambiguous;
    // it is imported twice in the same scope by
    // import O2._
    // and import O1._
    //     f("a")
    //     ^
  }

  // Import two with different names in the same scope.
  def m2 = {
    import O3._
    import O4._
  
    // Explicit calls compile.
    f1("a")
    f2("a")

    // Implicit usage fails.
    "a": Int
    // ./a.scala:36: error: type mismatch;
    //  found   : String("a")
    //  required: Int
    // Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
    //  both method f1 in object O3 of type (s: String)Int
    //  and method f2 in object O4 of type (s: String)Int
    //  are possible conversion functions from String("a") to Int
    //     "a": Int
    //     ^
  }
}
```
I'm working on a fix for #4270, which will also fix this, as they are closely kindred tickets.
