{{math.abs(-0.0)}} returns 0.0 as it should, but {{(-0.0).abs}} returns -0.0. The reason is that {{math.abs}} directly calls {{java.lang.Math.abs}} but {{(-0.0).abs}} is implemented in {{Numeric.scala}} by checking if the value is < 0, which fails for -0.0.

One way to fix this is to use {{compare}} instead of {{lt}}:

{code}
scala> -0.0 compare 0
res3: Int = -1

scala> 0.0 compare 0
res4: Int = 0
{code}

There may well be other bugs involving -0.0.
