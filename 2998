But we are talking about `javax.servlet.DispatcherType.REQUEST`â€“ a Java EE annotation. None of them should compile that enum. They should just use the one from `javaee-api-6.0.jar`

And let me check:
```scala
SET CLASSPATH=%[CLASSPATH];%[Repository]\javax\javaee-api\6.0\javaee-api-6.0.jar
```

Yep it is on the classpath as well.
