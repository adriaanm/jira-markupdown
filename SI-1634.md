The IzPack installer for Scala 2.7.3 fails to install the uninstaller on Windows x64:

ERROR You have not installed the DLL named 'ICE_JNIRegistry.DLL'.
	C:\Program Files\Scala\Uninstaller\ICE_JNIRegistry.dll: Can't load IA 32-bit .dll on a AMD 64-bit platform
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: com.ice.jni.registry.RegistryKey.openSubKey(Ljava/lang/String;I)Lcom/ice/jni/registry/RegistryKey;
	at com.ice.jni.registry.RegistryKey.openSubKey(Native Method)
	at com.ice.jni.registry.Registry.openSubkey(Registry.java:214)
	at Main.updateRegistry(Main.java:27)
	at Main.main(Main.java:124)

The installer will only work correctly at present if a 32-bit JVM is in use: the part of the installer that updates the registry entries relies on a DLL that was compiled as 32-bit code. That library is now unsupported (was last updated in 2003). Also, we can't force a 64-bit JVM to run in 32-bit mode, as there's no "-d32" on Windows.

IzPack has its own facility to update registry entries, but the uninstaller facility seems unable to cope with multiple updates of PATH: if another program adds its own entry at a later time, a subsequent use of the IzPack uninstaller will just revert PATH, rather than upgrading (I'd be happy to be proven wrong though); this is as of IzPack 4.3.1. So this is not a good solution either; furthermore, the IzPack facility is currently broken under Windows 7 (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/IZPACK-447).

We will have to look into some other solution in order to edit the windows registry from Java; until that is done, the installer won't work correctly on 64bit JVMs, unfortunately.

(In r19997) The glue JNI code has been recompiled and adapted,        
so that now it can be loaded both on w32 and x64
systems (two DLLs are provided, and the new adapter
will try both. The IzPack files have been modified
accordingly.

Hopefully this should fix SI-1634.

(In r20017) The installer finally works as expected on x64 systems
with 64bit VMs. Also, updated installer compiler
to version 4.3.2; added x64 support for shortcut
creation; fixed long-standing error in installation
files that was preventing registry entries from
ever being removed upon uninstallation; added
more informative messages during installation;
restored 1.5 as the minimal JVM version number
required for installation.

This revision closes SI-1634.
