The method aggregate has the following signature:

{{{
def aggregate[B](z: B)(seqop: (B, A) => B, combop: (B, B) => B): B
}}}

It is my understanding that this method exists for out-of-order folding, in particular for parallelisation. A collection is split into sub-collections into which z is folded independently using seqop. Once all sub-collections have been folded, we use comboop to combine the results of the partitioned folds. In the case of parallel folds, I would contend that it makes no sense whatsoever to use as the value of z anything other than the "zero" for the type B. For example:

{{{
   List(1, 2, 3, 4).aggregate(1)(_ + _, _ + _)
}}}

The user of the API may get 11 back from this calculation; they might also get 14! Thus the method is flawed in design.

What is more, because the same value of z is used in each partition, it is implicit that the type B must be immutable. So for example, the following gives nonsensical results

{{{
   List(1, 2, 3, 4).aggregate(new java.lang.StringBuffer)(_ append _, _ append _)
}}}

This is not documented at all and in fact it represents a completely unnecessary restriction: As `seqop` and `comboop` are both applied sequentially, if z were by-name (i.e. st a different z would be folded into each partition), the expression would not be nonsensical at all. The only thing that would be necessary is that, if z were mutable, comboop was threadsafe
1) I agree with you that `z` should be a by-name parameter. This would help in the sense that values of type `B` would no longer be required to be immutable. Making it a by-name parameter should be possible in a source-compatible way, I believe.

2) I disagree with you that "the method is flawed in design". The statement "z must be the zero element for the comb op" is a precondition on the method parameter which is, unfortunately, not expressible in the type system - and that is not the only example of such a method. Method `reduce` must have an associative reduction operator, otherwise the results are nondeterministic. Methods other than `next` and `hasNext` on the `Iterator` can be called only once, otherwise the results are undefined. Method `find` takes a predicate, which should not be `null`.
Methods for which preconditions are expressed in the documentation (which says that if these are not met, the results are undefined) are not "flawed in design".
Chris, I didn't intend to sound harsh myself! :)
Yes, a typeclass would be one way to do it. In fact, it may be sensible to add something like this to stdlib in the future.
Another way would be to require that the method can be called on non-empty collections only (like `reduce`), hence eliminating the need for the zero-element.
