In section 4.1 Value Declarations and Deﬁnitions of The Scala Language Speciﬁcation Version 2.8 (DRAFT July 13, 2010), for a pattern value definition:

  val p = e

it says:

If the pattern p has bound variables x 1 , . . . , x n , where n > 1:
   val $$x = e match {case p => {x 1 , . . . , x n }}
   val x 1 = $$x ._1
   ...
   val x n = $$x ._n   .

It seems that the braces surrounding x1-xn should be parentheses:

   val $$x = e match {case p => (x 1 , . . . , x n )}

The same issue occurs later in an example:

  val x$$ = mylist match { case x :: xs => {x, xs} }

which I suspect should be:

  val x$$ = mylist match { case x :: xs => (x, xs) } 
(In r24972) Closed SI-4544. Fixed typo in the spec, was using old syntax for tuples.
