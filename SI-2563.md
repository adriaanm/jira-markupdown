Two minor issues with nsc.!EvalLoop are:
 * On line 16 of nsc/!EvalLoop.scala, 'line' can be null when end of input is reached (such as when ctrl+d is pressed on unix or ctrl+z on windows).  line 17 does not check for null.
{code}
val line = Console.readLine
if (line.length() > 0) {
{code}
 * Additionally, 'loop' is not tail call optimized.
