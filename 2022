Here is another attempt to challange this issue: [commit|https://github.com/aborg0/scala-1/commit/83f358bcf0e4e035540caad7feb09be89ca61a2a] (this time it is quite recent, so if it is suitable I guess it can be merged, passes all the tests). I think the important parts are mentioned in the commit message, although it worth noting, that UTF-7 is not supported.
