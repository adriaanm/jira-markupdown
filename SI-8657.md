At least that's the most specific explanation that I've found yet.

From https://gist.github.com/jrudolph/d5213d32d425fce0d88a:

{code}
  def run() =
    {
      @tailrec def rec(count: Long): Boolean =
        if (count == 0) true else rec(count - 1)
 
      rec(1000000L)
    } && true
{code}

Here's the original report:

Parboiled2 relies heavily on expressions like this.
@tailrec was one of my very first commits to the compiler, and it has barely been touched since that time - put it all together and it spells... yeah.

     The birth of the @switch and @tailrec annotations.
{code}

Cool :)

Actually, this wasn't so much about the annotation but more about the optimization itself. It turns out one part of the bug (If condition) was already introduced in the original introduction of tailcall optimization in 2005:

    Added tail call elimination phase to nsc.
{code}

and the other part (left operand of && / ||) was added in 2007:

    Catch tail calls made from tail boolean or.
{code}

So much for the history...

The fix was merged as https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3832
