One of those comments I have never understood.  In ConstantFolder:
{code}
  private def fold(tree: Tree, compX: => Constant): Tree =
    try {
      val x = compX
      if ((x ne null) && x.tag != UnitTag) tree setType ConstantType(x) 
      else tree
    } catch {
      case _: ArithmeticException => tree   // the code will crash at runtime,
                                           // but that is better than the
                                           // compiler itself crashing
    }
{code}
To me it seems like the compiler itself crashing would be better, a lot better.  Or just emitting an error would be fine.

As it stands if we compile this class:
{code}
import annotation._

class bippy() {
  @elidable(55 / 0) def f() = 5
}
{code}
We get either a corrupt scala signature or one which showPickled needs to be educated about.

{code}

It's better to crash at runtime because we do not want to spec anything about arithmetic errors. It would be piece-wise and messy (btw Scala is in agreement with basically every other language that has a spec here). Consequently elidable gets a tree as an argument just as if you had written.
{code}
elidable{x * x}
{code}
So, everything as it should be, AFAICS.

it's almost certainly a bug in the signature printer. i think nobody updated it in a long time.
