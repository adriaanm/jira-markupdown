As another point of interest, I changed { case _: Throw | *: Literal } to { case *: Literal } and all tests in trunk still pass.  So if it is achieving something, there's no test case which reveals what it is.  I was curious enough to track it to commit r12521, where the commit tell us "code generation: if pattern body is throw, generate throw directly (no sharing)" but no motivation is given and there are no comments.
