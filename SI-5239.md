Given this code, the type checker won't print the typings, even though we explicitly ask it to do so:

```scala
val settings = new Settings
settings.Ytyperdebug.value = true

val reporter = new ConsoleReporter(settings)
val toolbox = new ToolBox(reporter)
val ttree = toolbox.typeCheck(code.tree)
```
(burmako in [r26081](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26081)) Reflection toolboxes now respect settings that are provided to them.

Before the fix CompilerCommand lacked the (args, settings, errorFn) ctor.
I added it and provided means to augment passed settings with custom errorFn.

Closes #5239. Review by odersky.
