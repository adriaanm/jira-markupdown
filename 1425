Mostly I think it's worth fixing because the cost is low -- the patch is already provided. Does the risk of that minor change really outweigh the benefit of ensuring that imported projects work how people expect? Nevertheless, I won't be offended if you prefer to just close it as wontfix. I know how to avoid the issue, and if it becomes a real problem somebody will eventually reopen the bug.

I consider it a plugin issue because the "scrub" setting is not really a project-specific setting for Scala projects; it is a universal requirement for all Scala projects. If it were only an issue for Maven, I could understand offloading the requirement. However, it's more serious because it applies not just to Maven projects, but to _any_ imported Scala project for which somebody forgot to package up the .settings folder. And for projects that DO properly export the settings folder, other users will unwittingly pickup the creator's other JDT prefs, including potentially unportable settings like JRE version. Also, I expect Lift projects are becoming popular and it makes sense to accommodate that user community.
