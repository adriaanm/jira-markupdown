> As pf r12607, this check was commented out. The commit comment isn't illuminating -- scala/bug#1269 is a `worksforme` and a cursory search over the interwebs doesn't reveal the origin or intention of (Stephan?) Kolstov's patch.

Tip from a seasoned, weathered, barely hanging on scala archaeologist: if the ticket number doesn't make any sense odds are it's in the pre-trac bug database, which is archived online.  Here is scala/bug#1269.

http://www.scala-lang.org/sites/default/files/aladdin/displayItem.do%3Fid=1269.html

It was opened 8/8/07 and the commit is 8/21/07 and logic takes us the rest of the way.
