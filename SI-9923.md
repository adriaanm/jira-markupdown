Given

```sbt
scalaVersion  := "2.12.0-RC1"
addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.1.0" cross CrossVersion.full)
libraryDependencies += "com.github.mpilquist" %% "simulacrum" % "0.9.0"
scalacOptions += "-Ywarn-unused-import"
```
and
```scala
import simulacrum._

@typeclass trait Monoid[A]

```

Running yields:

```bash
[warn] examples/examples1.scala:1: Unused import
[warn] import simulacrum._
[warn]
```

Worked fine in 2.10 and 2.11. Same error is also seen when using `macrocompat.bundle`

I hope to add a commit at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5402

It seems to me like an important use case that should be technically feasible. But I haven't looked at it yet.
Thx,

Now that the "Either method deprecations" has been agreed, I'm pretty sure that this is the only remaining issue that requires a "fix" - 

see https://github.com/BennyHill/cats/blob/409e39e6a8efa3f83bf79dcca38602db3530a007/build.sbt#L563-L569 and
  https://github.com/typelevel/catalysts/blob/master/build.sbt#L262-L272
With apologies for the busywork of the workaround, we're going to have to delay fixing this until 2.12.1, as it has a workaround and a non-zero risk of regression (the @deprecated annotation has a workaround too, but the risk of regression at least is zero).
I was looking at paradise for 2.11. The fix to support -Ywarn-unused-import is not on the paradise branch for 2.12.
