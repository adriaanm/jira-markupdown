This seems related to SI-900, but a different issue.

I was trying to match on a case object in a for comprehension, but it kept matching all elements. I managed to reduce it to the following test case. It seems that even identifiers starting with a capital letter, or surrounded by back-ticks are treated as free variables. (There is no {{What}} identifier  defined at all).

{code:scala}
scala> case object Test
defined object Test

scala> for (Test <- List(1 ,2, 3)) println(Test)
1
2
3

scala> for (What <- List(1, 2, 3)) println(What)
1
2
3

scala> for (`What` <- List(1, 2, 3)) println(What)
1
2
3
{code}

I expected these to behave as in a regular pattern match. I get the same result in 2.11.5, 2.11.6, and 2.12.0-M1.
The workaround is:

{code}
scala> for (t @ Test <- List(1 ,2, 3)) println(Test)
<console>:9: error: pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
 found   : Test.type
 required: Int
              for (t @ Test <- List(1 ,2, 3)) println(Test)
                       ^
{code}
Is there a label for "has-stackoverflow-question"?
