Note - since the {{ConcurrentMap}} interface is enriched in Java 8, we might also consider doing this in Scala.
Since it's only a matter of time before we do, I will implement a {{computeIfAbsent}} method in {{TrieMap}} and override the {{getOrElseUpdate}} to call that.

Eventually, we want to do the same in {{ConcurrentMap}}, {{computeIfAbsent}} being abstract.
