I'm hijacking this issue, if that's OK, for a macro that does named groups (by parsing them out, for Java 6 support, and supplying them to `Regex`) and as a bonus (which I think was a D.C. Sobral request on StackOverflow), optional groups are extracted as Option instead of nullable.  I don't know why they call them macros instead of magic.

Still to do: interpolator ensures holes and groups balance; nail down a nicer syntax for how holes "bind" to groups. Note that `(\d+)$i` is kind of backward to `$i%d`.

Since we are used to f-interp, how about a scanf version, `sf"$s%s $n%d $v%f"`, that would cover the common extractions.
