For whatever reason the changes in src/compiler/scala/tools/cmd/gen/AnyVals.scala have still not propagated to Int.scala, Long.scala, etc. and the documentation of >> operator is still incorrect:
http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.Int
abstract def >>(x: Int): Int
"Returns this value bit-shifted *left* by the specified number of bits, filling in the *right* bits with the same value as the left-most bit of this."
