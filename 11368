Hmm, `nextEol` is indeed very quadratic. Not to mention `seq.length` is called on the underlying `PagedSeq` all over `StreamReader`, which will force the whole thing into memory.

Passing a `BufferedReader` to it will not help, sadly, but `StreamReader` extends `PagedSeqReader`, so if you don't need its "one line at a time" semantics, you can just use `PagedSeqReader` directly with
```scala
new PagedSeqReader(PagedSeq.fromReader(reader))
```

Thanks for reporting this. A fix is coming :)
