(In r20794) Raised the level of abstraction (slightly, not enough) on
ClassPath by defining the difference between optimized and
regular classpaths in terms of an arbitrary name filter instead
of in terms of settings.XO.  Altered the decision logic to
look at the value of -Yinline instead of -optimise.
Closes SI-2950.  Review by rytz.
