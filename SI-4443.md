At least that is my estimation.
```scala
abstract class Foo extends App {
  def value: String

  // the "delayed init" wanting part
  println(value.length)
}

object Test extends Foo {
  val value = "abc"
}
```
This throws an NPE, apparently because the assignment of "abc" to value is considered initialization code, and since it's in the subclass it follows the println.

But the definition of value is the implementation of an abstract method.  Shouldn't definitions be complete before the loose constructor code starts being run?
