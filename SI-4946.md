Calling "loop" within another "loop" statement results in a reference being kept to the previous closure. Attached is a simple example showing this behavior.

*Expected behavior*:
The script continues running indefinitely, 

*Actual behavior*:
A java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space is thrown.

{code:scala}
import actors._
import Actor._

case object A
case object B

def doLoop(i: Int) {
  loop {
    react {
      case A => println(i)
      case B => doLoop(i + 1)
    }
  }
}

val a = actor { doLoop(0) }

while(true) {
  (1 to 5000).foreach { i => a ! B }
  a ! A
}
{code}
The cause seems to be thus:

actors/Combinators.scala # L26
{code:java}
  def loop(body: => Unit): Unit = body andThen loop(body)
{code}

actors/Reactor.scala # L257
{code:java}
  implicit def mkBody[A](body: => A) = new Actor.Body[A] {
    def andThen[B](other: => B): Unit = Reactor.this.seq(body, other)
  }
{code}

actors/Reactor.scala # L269
{code:java}
  private[actors] def seq[a, b](first: => a, next: => b): Unit = {
    val killNext = this.kill
    this.kill = () => {
      this.kill = killNext

      // to avoid stack overflow:
      // instead of directly executing `next`,
      // schedule as continuation
      scheduleActor({ case _ => next }, null)
      throw Actor.suspendException
    }
    first
    throw new KillActorControl
  }
{code}

Every time `loop` is called, the `kill` variable for that actor is switched out with a new one that links the old `kill`. Though it's likely that removing this will break other places where `Reactor.seq` will be used, at least in this case (where it's called by `loop`) I'm not sure that it serves any purpose.
