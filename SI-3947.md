Given the the following files:

`p/J.java`
{code}
package p;
public class J {
    protected void m() { return; }
}
{code}

`p/q/S.scala`
{code}
package p.q
class S extends p.J {
  protected[p] override def m() { }
}
{code}

When compiling first the Java file and then the Scala file, things work as expected:
{code}
lamppc11:bug2 luc$$ javac p/J.java 
lamppc11:bug2 luc$$ ../../target/pack/bin/scalac p/q/S.scala 
lamppc11:bug2 luc$$ 
{code}

However, compiling them together with `scalac` gives an error message:

{code}
lamppc11:bug2 luc$$ ../../target/pack/bin/scalac p/J.java p/q/S.scala 
p/q/S.scala:4: error: method m overrides nothing
  protected[p] override def m() { }
                            ^
one error found
{code}

I suspect this is the same as SI-3939.
I don't think it's the same because SI-3939 works in 2.8.0, while this one here doesn't. But they might be related.

Oddly enough I was just seeing if these two tickets are regressions.  I find this one does work in 2.8.0.
{code}
% scalac28 p/J.java a.scala 
% find p/
p
p/J.java
p/q
p/q/S.class  
% jp p.q.S | grep extends
public class p.q.S extends p.J implements scala.ScalaObject
{code}

True, I messed up my tests, then.. so it is most likely the same as SI-3939.
(In r23355) A modifier's work is never done.  Another mortal embrace with
protected and its bevy of corner cases.  Closes SI-3939, SI-3947.
This patch is intended for both trunk and 2.8.1.  Already reviewed
and co-authored by moors, and review by oderksy.
