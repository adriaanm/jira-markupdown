I think that example is "correct" because of SI-7278.  "Same-named inner classes which are in no relationship with each other are explicitly allowed in both Java and Scala." The Element in A2 is not the Element in A1. But parameter types must match exactly. So the method declared in A1#Element has a different signature than the one declared in A2#Element.

If it seems unsound, it's because it is.
