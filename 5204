It seems that the following is also accepted,
```scala
scala> class Up { def update(as : Int*) {} }                                                                 
defined class Up

scala> val up = new Up                      
up: Up = Up@129dcc0

scala> up() = 0

scala> up(0) = 1

scala> up(0, 1) = 2

scala> up(0, 1, 2) = 3

scala> 
```
