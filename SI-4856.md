The behavior or forward references to vals and recursive values is a bit odd and inconsistent.

---
1.

In a class initializer a val can refer to a val not yet declared and no error or warning is issued, instead the value is treated as zero or null.

For example:

{code}

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

class Foo {
val bar = x+1
val x = 5
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Foo

scala> val foo = new Foo
foo: Foo = Foo@7875455c

scala> foo.bar
res0: Int = 1
{code}

Int the end the value of x is treated as zero unexpectedly.  I would expect either foo.bar to 6 or give an error at compile time or run time.  This could easily create bugs where someone reordered vals in the initializer such a way that some of them would now be null or zero.

You can use lazy vals and by-name parameters to create an object that refers to itself.  However, if that self-reference is evaluated too soon you get null instead of the expected value.

For example:

{code}
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

class Root(child0: => Child) {
 lazy val child = child0
}

class Child(parent0: => Root) {
 lazy val parent = parent0
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Root
defined class Child

scala> val what:Root = new Child(what).parent
what: Root = null

scala> val w2:Root = new Root(new Child(w2)).child.parent
w2: Root = null
{code}

I would have preferred to get a run time exception or (better) a compile error in this case.

For comparison, when used inside {}'s local vals referring to later vals actually are reordered to evaluate properly.  
For example:

{code}
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

def ??? = {
val result = prefix + suffix;
val prefix = "should this "
val suffix = "really work?"
result
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

$qmark$qmark$qmark: java.lang.String

scala> ???
res4: java.lang.String = should this really work?
{code}

This is clever but it does mean that there's an inconsistency between this and a class initialization (where they are not reordered and no error is reported).

A val that refers directly to itself either gets zero for itself, or if you put lazy in front you can create infinite recursion:

{code}
scala> val one:Int = 10 - one
one: Int = 10

scala> lazy val one:Int = 10 - one
one: Int = <lazy>

scala> one
java.lang.StackOverflowError
{code}

I can only imagine that there is some rare use case for forward and recursive references within vals but I can't help but wonder if this is really a helpful capability or just making things more confusing.

At my level I can't even figure out how to define a recursive val that isn't infinitely recursive without involving some method that has a side-effect.

---

If it were me, I would forbid any reference or use of a val that would ever return any value other than its final, initialized value.  This would mean pretty much all the use cases above would return either a compile-time or run-time error where they currently yield a value or zero or null.


3 is a bug, not cleverness.  In trunk it's a compile-time error.

<console>:9: error: forward reference extends over definition of value result
              val result = prefix + suffix;
                                    ^

This ticket is a duplicate of about a thousand others, but I'll leave it open since it gave me an idea.  Your advice at the end is impossible unless you want to prohibit overriding vals.

Here's a val referring to itself and making the fibonacci sequence.

scala> val fib: Stream[Int] = 1 #:: ((0 #:: fib zip fib) map { case (x, y) => x + y })
fib: Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> fib take 10 toList
res0: List[Int] = List(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55)
