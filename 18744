In a Scaladoc external link, if an end-of-line (EOL) sequence follows the URL, then scaladoc appears to treat the EOL and the first part of the label that follows it as part of the URL. It cannot verify the resulting URL and results in a warning.

For example, if scaladoc encounters an external link of the form:

{noformat}Here's [[http://my.example.com/SomeInterestingStuff
Some Interesting Stuff]]{noformat}

Then scaladoc will produce the following warning:

{noformat}somefile.scala:1: warning Could not find any member to link for "http://my.example.com/SomeInterestingStuff
Some".{noformat}

All that appears in the output, in this case, is *Interesting Stuff*.
