I should point out that it's unlikely that you meant to refer to {{Unit}} in the else branch, and probably meant:

{code}
  if (nonTrivialCondition == 42) {
    returnsPrimitive(5)
  } else {
    ()
  }
{code}

In such code, no boxing is incurred under {{-optimize}}, test case: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/6527
