Ok, may be you're right. 
But I'm also right.
I mean syntax summary, which is more important for parser then all specification.
```scala
BlockStat ::= Import
               | [‘implicit’ | ‘lazy’] Def
               | {LocalModifier} TmplDef
               | Expr1
```

There is no annotations before Def here. So I think about local definitions, that it couldn't have annotations.
