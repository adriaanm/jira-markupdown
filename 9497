For most of this I used the Scala IDE (v3.0.0rc3-2_10-2013-03-131031-dac2f1c, which has scala 2.10.1). I had also replicated the problem with list.tail() on the command line, again using 2.10.1 (SomeScala.scala in src/scala, Main.java in src/java):
{noformat}
./scalac -sourcepath src/java/* src/scala/*
javac -classpath /home/dnadolny/tools/scala-2.10.1/lib/scala-library.jar:. -d . src/java/Main.java
./scala Main
{noformat}

I have also reproduced it with 2.10.0, however it works correctly under 2.9.2.
