Issue is fixed as of r19008 and r19011. The installer, as configured, could not really be used to install stuff safely in `/usr/local`. The layout of the files installed by the installer has been reorganized on *nix and OSX: all will be created in a separate `[path]/scala` directory ({{/usr/local/scala}} for root, `~/scala` for other users). A stern warning will appear if a user tries to store files in a potentially dangerous location. Also, on OSX the installer no longer tries to install files in `/usr/local` or in `/Applications`.

These fixes will appear in 2.8; they are also likely to appear in the next stable 2.7.x revision, although no final decision has been made at this stage.
