This makes the combination of {{-optimize}} and {{-Xfatal-warnings}} pretty much unusable, since even if you don't explicitly pass {{-Yinline-warnings}}, the "re-run with -Yinline-warnings for details" warning itself is fatal.

I believe almost any well-managed project should be using {{-Xfatal-warnings}}, so this means I can't use the 2.11 optimizer on any of my projects.
