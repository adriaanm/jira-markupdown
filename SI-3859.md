The following compiles with scala 2.8.0:

```scala
package test

class Test {

  def foo: Unit = bar(Array(): _*)
  
  def bar(values: AnyRef*): Unit = ()
}
```

With 2.8.1 RC1, an error is issued:

```scala
test/Test.scala:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.reflect.Manifest[Nothing]
 required: scala.reflect.ClassManifest[T]
  def foo: Unit = bar(Array(): _*)
```

bar(Array[AnyRef](): _*) compiles with both versions.
(In r23128) closes #3859. need to instantiate type parameters to nothing explicitly in manifestOfType's searchresult rather than relying on later calls to instantiate.

(In r23129) partial revert of r23128 ("see #3859. need to instantiate type parameters to nothing explicitly in manifestOfType's searchresult rather than relying on later calls to instantiate."): the isArray_apply test cleanup was not a good idea (my pre-commit automated testing turned out to be broken.. me.gitfu--)

no review
