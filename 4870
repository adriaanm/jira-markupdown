Yes, there is always some trade-off. I will bring it up on the meeting. 

wrt to the bug. We shouldn't produce different bytecode on different compilation order of the files even for a simple case like that:
A.scala
{code}
class A {
    lazy val a = 12
}
{code}
B.scala
{code}
class B extends A {
    lazy val b = 14
}
{code}
This is just asking for trouble.
