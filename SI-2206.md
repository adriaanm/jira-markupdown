```scala
class A

class AX {
    def f() { }
}

import Implicits._
val a = new A
a.f()

object Implicits {
    implicit def ax(a: A) = new AX
}
```

```scala
discarding <script preamble>
(fragment of hello.scala):9: error: value f is not a member of this.A
a.f()
   ^
```

I think that either import should fail or (preferred to me, code should be compileable).

I tend to agree that this is a bug, because given the import statement, the implicit should be made available -- however in case you are unaware, in general implicits which lexically follow the point at which you want them to work need an explicit return type to be considered.  And this example does work if you supply it.
```scala
  implicit def ax(a: A): AX = new AX
```
I don't think it's possible to compile this. The problem is that we have to be very careful which implicits to evaluate, for fear of falling into infinite cycles. So the best thing we could do is give a better error message. I'm reassgning back to you, Paul, but I'm also happy if you turn it into a won't fix subsequently.
