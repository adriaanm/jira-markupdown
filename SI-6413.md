The Scala packages for RedHat (RPM) and Debian (DEB) based Linux distributions contain a version of JLine although there are packages for this library in the official repositories.

The packaged version of JLine creates a conflict for `/usr/share/java/jline.jar` so that the Scala package cannot be installed without disabling file conflict checks in the package manager.

Relevant bug report for Ubuntu Linux in Launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jline/+bug/1007011

**Packages**:

- [Debian](http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libjline-java)
- [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/libjline-java)
- [CentOS](http://pkgs.org/centos-6-rhel-6/centos-rhel-i386/jline-0.9.94-0.8.el6.noarch.rpm.html)
- [Fedora](http://pkgs.org/fedora-17/fedora-i386/jline-1.0-1.fc17.noarch.rpm.html)
- [openSUSE](http://pkgs.org/opensuse-12.2/opensuse-java-i586/jline-0.9.94-23.1.noarch.rpm.html)

Possible bug fix is either placing `jline.jar` in another directory, prefixing it (e. g. `scala-jline.jar`), or preferably use the official packages of the respective Linux distribution.
Would it be possible to include that change for the upcoming Scala 2.9.3 packages?

While having a fix in Scala 2.10.0 is nice, a fixed package for Scala 2.9.x would be appreciated very much.

I think renaming the `jline.jar` file to `scala-jline.jar` would be the easiest way to fix the problem with duplicate files.
