A couple of things detected:

* No history with up/down arrows
* Semi-random cursor behavior, not easily test-case reproducable, but reproducable when encountered. E.g. typing a particular sequence of characters caused the cursor to jump to the start of the line. This happened every time with that particular string. (Yes, would be nice to have that string, but my console is now closed, and I can't get any history :-) )

If one calls {{scala.bat}} from Cygwin, the behavior is much improved. Perhaps this can be detected inside the bash script?
Sorry about that. I wasn't paying much attention to who commented, just saw "What OS?".

Anyway, I'm on Win10 64-bit, using cyginw64 (not sure what version, but very recent), running inside ConEmu 151210.

I'm actually running through {{scala.bat}} now and it mostly works, although seems to hang on {{:quit}}. Again, some of this could be ConEmu related, not sure.
[~nilskp] Could you please post a transcripts of `bash -x scala` from your system for 2.11.7 and 2.11.8? 
{{scala -Djline.terminal=windows}} does not appear to make any difference.
