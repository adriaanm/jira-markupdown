(In r22979) closes SI-3612. relaxed self-type conformance check slightly by comparing the self types instead of the self-type symbols, which are trivially different when you introduce a self variable without giving it a type

given the definitions below (for full context, see test file), before, O0 would work but O would not, now both are accepted:

{code}
object O0 extends C {}
object O extends C { self => }
{code}
