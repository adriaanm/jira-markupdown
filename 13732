Consider

{code}
  case class Select(tree : Tree, name : Name)
  def Select(tree : Tree, sym : Symbol)
{code}

A client 

{code}
  val name : String = ...;
  Select(tree, name)
{code}

where there is an implicit coercion from string to name. The IDE will misidentify this sometimes as being an error.
