There is such a status - "NEEDINFO" - but presumably I consider this more of a closed issue than you do.  I did say in my closing comment "in the absence of a better argument", which is what "needinfo" would mean.

Because JIRA is a steaming pile of garbage, I can't assign anything to the submitter without firing up the admin interface and adding them to the list of "scala developers", which isn't going to happen. (The alternative, that tickets can be assigned to everyone, means that I get a dropdown list of 4000 people every time I want to assign a ticket.  There is apparently no middle ground.)
