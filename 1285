The bug was introduced in r15620.  I am attaching a patch against the 2.7.2 tree which makes it go away, with all tests still passing (I had some kind of blip on the docgenerator tests, but they passed when I re-ran them so I think/hope it was unrelated.) As I am still practicing "cargo cult debugging" I make no claims this is the correct fix, only that the test case from scala/bug#1460 will now compile, and, I boldly predict, whatever code induced scala/bug#1467 will also work.
