Given a class that is specialized on a type parameter, T and a method specialized on a type parameter
W, the compiler does not generate the cross-product of methods required to avoid boxing and unboxing.  When the type parameter is moved from the class to the method, all of the variations are created.

The is demonstrated in the following two gists:
Boxing occurs on case Function1[T,W] but not Function1[T,T]
Type parameter in class definition AND method.
https://gist.github.com/1425438

No boxing, type parameter moved to method from class.
https://gist.github.com/1434304


In the later case, we see from byte code that we will be calling the specialized Function1 apply methods,
so no boxing/unboxing will occur.  I would expect that the same **should** happen in the first example.
Please don't link to gists; please don't supply test code which is not self-contained; please don't include a bunch of extraneous detail.

After that, it looks like this.
```scala
class ClassMethod[@specialized T](x: T) {
  def m1[@specialized W](f: T => W): W = f(x)
  def m2(f: T => T): T = f(x)
}

class ClassClass[@specialized T, @specialized W](x: T) {
  def m3(f: T => W): W = f(x)
  def m4(f: T => T): T = f(x)
}
```

```
// ClassClass$mcII$sp
public int m3(scala.Function1);

   1:	aload_1
   2:	invokevirtual	#13; //Method m3$mcII$sp:(Lscala/Function1;)I
   5:	ireturn

   8:	invokeinterface	#34,  2; //InterfaceMethod scala/Function1.apply:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
   13:	areturn
```
I apologize, as this is my first posting after being prompted from twitter.  

This example still does not specialize on the return type

```scala
class Blah[@specialized T] {
  def blah[@specialized W](f:T=>W,x:T):W  = {
    f(x)
}
}
```



Nor does this

```scala
class Blah[@specialized T](a:Array[T]) {
  def blah[@specialized W](f:T=>W):W  = {
    f(a(0))
}
}
```
This does generate the unboxed specialized methods
```scala
class Blah2[@specialized T,@specialized W](a:Array[T]) {
  def blah(f:T=>W):W  = {
    f(a(0))
}
}
```
I have been looking into this further.

Simplifying to only specialize on Int, this code does not generate a blah method that is to int, only to java.lang.Object.

And as I said above, if the variable to act on is in the method definition, we see the same thing.

```scala
class Blah[@specialized (Int) T](a:T) {
  def blah[@specialized (Int) W](f:T=>W):W  = f(a) 
}
```

```scala
public java.lang.Object blah(scala.Function1, scala.reflect.Manifest);
  Code:

Adding something like this though, will generate the necessary specialization.

```scala
class Blah[@specialized (Int) T:Manifest](a:T) {
  def blah[@specialized (Int) S>:T, @specialized (Int)  W:Manifest](f:S=>W):W  =f(a) 
}
```

```scala

  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=3, Args_size=3
   0:	aload_1
   1:	aload_0
   2:	getfield	#26; //Field a$mcI$sp:I
   5:	invokeinterface	#44,  2; //InterfaceMethod scala/Function1.apply$mcII$sp:(I)I
   10:	ireturn
```
It seems you're looking at the wrong place. I'll take the example reduced by Paul, and show that all specialization are performed correctly (unless I'm missing something). I added client call to test if specialization is correctly performed all across the board.

```scala
class ClassMethod[@specialized(Int) T](x: T) {
  def m1[@specialized(Int) W](f: T => W): W = f(x)
  def m2(f: T => T): T = f(x)
}

class Test {
  def test() {
    val x = new ClassMethod(1)
    x.m1(x => x + 1)
  }
}
```

Printing trees after specialization, Test.test looks like this:

```scala
def test(): Unit = {
      val x: ClassMethod[Int] = new ClassMethod$mcI$sp(1);
      {
        x.m1$mIcI$sp({
          @SerialVersionUID(0) final <synthetic> class $anonfun extends scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1$mcII$sp with Serializable {
            def this(): anonymous class $anonfun = {
              $anonfun.super.this();
              ()
            };
            final def apply(x: Int): Int = $anonfun.this.apply$mcII$sp(x);
            <specialized> def apply$mcII$sp(v1: Int): Int = v1.+(1)
          };
          (new anonymous class $anonfun(): (Int) => Int)
        });
        ()
      }
    }
```

Looks good to me!

You are looking at `m1$mcI$sp`, which is a specialization based only on class parameters. In order to hit the sweet spot, you need to be in a specialized case for both the method and class type parameters. That variant is called `m1$mIcI$sp` (the encoding of specialized methods is 'm' followed by instantiations for method type parameters, followed by 'c' and instantiations of the class type parameters). You were looking at `m1$mcI`, but that one can not call the int variant of m1, since it still has the type parameter `W` (you don't see it in bytecode, that's why I suggest you use `-Xprint:spec`):

```scala
class ClassMethod[@specialized(scala.Int) T >: Nothing <: Any] extends java.lang.Object with ScalaObject {
    <paramaccessor> protected[this] val x: T = _;
    def this(x: T): ClassMethod[T] = {
      ClassMethod.super.this();
      ()
    };
    def m1[@specialized(scala.Int) W >: Nothing <: Any](f: (T) => W): W = f.apply(ClassMethod.this.x);
    def m2(f: (T) => T): T = f.apply(ClassMethod.this.x);
    <specialized> def m1$mcI$sp[@specialized(scala.Int) W >: Nothing <: Any](f: (Int) => W): W = ClassMethod.this.m1[W](f.asInstanceOf[(T) => W]()).asInstanceOf[W]();
    <specialized> def m1$mIc$sp(f: (T) => Int): Int = f.apply(ClassMethod.this.x);
    <specialized> def m1$mIcI$sp(f: (Int) => Int): Int = ClassMethod.this.m1$mIc$sp(f.asInstanceOf[(T) => Int]());
    <specialized> def m2$mcI$sp(f: (Int) => Int): Int = ClassMethod.this.m2(f.asInstanceOf[(T) => T]()).asInstanceOf[Int]()
  };
```

So, I was a bit optimistic. Here's a pretty robust test case that proves that it is working, except in the case of AnyRef specialization:

```scala
import scala.{specialized => spec}

class D[@spec T, @spec W](t:T, w:W)

object D {
  def get[@spec T, @spec W](t:T, w:W) = {
    println(new D[T, W](t, w).getClass.getName)
    w
  }
}

class C[@spec T](x: T) {
  def m[@spec W](f: T => W): W = f(x)
}

object Test {
  // annotated all the types to work around SI-5526
  def main(args:Array[String]) {
    println(new D[Int, Int](1, 1).getClass.getName)
    println(new D[Int, String](1, "a").getClass.getName)
    println(new D[String, Int]("a", 1).getClass.getName)
    println(new D[String, String]("a", "a").getClass.getName)
    println(new D[Int, Double](1, 2.0).getClass.getName)

    // this output should be the same as above
    new C[Int](1).m[Int]((x:Int) => D.get[Int, Int](x, 1))
    new C[Int](1).m[String]((x:Int) => D.get[Int, String](x, "a"))
    new C[String]("a").m[Int]((x:String) => D.get[String, Int](x, 1))
    new C[String]("a").m[String]((x:String) => D.get[String, String](x, "a"))
    new C[Int](1).m[Double]((x:Int) => D.get[Int, Double](x, 2.0))
  }
}
```

The output I get is:

```scala
D$mcII$sp
D$mcIL$sp
D$mcLI$sp
D
D$mcID$sp
D$mcII$sp
D
D
D
D$mcID$sp
```

The top 5 lines are correct, but the bottom 5 should be the same as the top, which they are except in the IL and LI cases. It seems that AnyRef specialization is working when invoked directly (in cases 2 and 3) but not when invoked indirectly (cases 7 and 8).

I think I may close this bug (since it seems to be working in the case that Marc originally posted) and open a new one dealing with this AnyRef behavior.
Because my last comments are so confused, I will restate the problem:

C$mcI$sp doesn't have an implmentation of m$mIcI$sp, so it inherits C's implmentation, which uses boxing on T and W.

The basic problem seems to be that needsSpecialization doesn't ever get called with an env containing T and W: the envs are either Map(T -> Int) or Map(W -> Int) but not both. This means that all needsSpecialization calls involving m$mIcI$sp return false.

I think (hope?) if we asked about the env Map(T -> Int, W -> Int) it would return true.
This is fixed in 2.10.x, I believe by 97ae6f6.

I tested a version of Marc's original example:

```scala
class M[@specialized(Int) T](x: T) {
  def m1[@specialized(Int) W](f: T => W): W = f(x)
  def m2(f: T => T): T = f(x)
}

class C[@specialized(Int) T, @specialized(Int) W](x: T) {
  def m3(f: T => W): W = f(x)
  def m4(f: T => T): T = f(x)
}

object Test {
  def aaa = new M[Int](33).m1((z:Int) => z + 1)
  def bbb = new M[Int](34).m2((z:Int) => z + 2)
  def ccc = new C[Int, Int](35).m3((z:Int) => z + 3)
  def ddd = new C[Int, Int](36).m4((z:Int) => z + 4)
}
```

For method invocations, I saw:

```scala
aaa: M$mcI$sp.m1$mIcI$sp // class specialized on T=I, method on W=I as well
bbb: M$mcI$sp.m2$mcI$sp // class specialized on I only, method on same T
ccc: C$mcII$sp.m3$mcII$sp // class specialized on T=I, W=I, method on same
ddd: C$mcII$sp.m4$mcI$sp // class specialized on T=I, W=I, method only on T
```

This looks like what is expected.

If someone else wants to doublecheck that would be great. Otherwise I'll close since I'm the assignee.
This might need to go under a new issue (existing issue?), but the compiler blows up using a combination of specialization & tailrec on 2.10.x:

```scala
trait Iter[@specialized(Int) A] {
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next(): A
  def foldLeft[@specialized(Int) Y](init: Y)(f: (Y, A) => Y): Y = {
    @tailrec
    def fold(init: Y): Y =
      if (!hasNext)
        init
      else
        fold(f(init, next()))
    fold(init)
  }

//  // Works:
//  def foldLeft[@specialized(Int) Y](init: Y)(f: (Y, A) => Y): Y = {
//    var acc = init
//    while(hasNext) {
//      val a = next()
//      acc = f(acc, a)
//    }
//    acc
//  }
}

```
You didn't post your crash. Does it seem to relate to this bug? #5788

I saw this awhile ago but it was marked fixed.

I'll try to look at this soon. In the meantime, if it isn't already in the bug system please open a new bug.
Ok, no problem.  It does look like a duplicate of #5788.  In fact, 

```scala
trait Foo[@specialized(Int) A] {
  final def bar(a:A):A = bar(a)
}
```

Does seem to result in the same issue.
