note that the existentials from the original report stem from the REPL -- replaying his transcript with debugging output:

{code}
val res0: Manifest[$$anon$$34941] forSome { type $$anon$$34941 <: Object with A with B{} } = 
  inferredType[anonymous class $$anon$$34870]({
      final class $$anon$$34870 extends Object with A with B
      new $$anon$$34870.this()
    })(Manifest.classType[anonymous class $$anon$$34870](classOf[line4$$object$$$$$$iw$$$$iw$$res0 $$$$anon]));
{code}

the RHS is essentially the same as in a full scalac run, but the computed type for res0 is packed to get rid of the reference to the anonymous class

Martin, I'm reassigning to you for a hint or two on how to tackle this
