I made some research and maybe found the problem - the original request was to use "Alt"-Key sequences in the editor:
https://github.com/jline/jline2/issues/144
to support any Alt-Key sequences mentioned here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C1_set
Unfortunately the implementation does not seem to distinguish between the "Alt" and the "Alt Gr" key. The Alt-Gr key however is used on some non-US keyboards for inserting square brackets, the @-symbol, curly braces, etc. 
https://github.com/jline/jline2/commit/22b3a2dce329e83a5ecfba137bde404c85954d47
So we get some fine Escape-sequences when inserting square brackets (or @) on some keyboards.
