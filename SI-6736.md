```scala
scala> (Int.MinValue until 0).contains(4)
res18: Boolean = true
```

```scala
scala> (0 to Int.MaxValue).contains(4)
res21: Boolean = false
```
Scala 2.9.2 is not affected as it won't evaluate:
```
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: -2147483648 until 0 by 1: seqs cannot contain more than Int.MaxValue elements.
```
`contains` seems to be good to me. It uses step-aware isWithinBoundaries and then checks that the value is n*step away from the start.

```
final def contains(x: Int) = isWithinBoundaries(x) && ((x - start) % step == 0)
```
I'm not sure that's the issue here. If not otherwise specified, step is always 1. In the given examples the range is ascending anyways, so the check just needs to get fixed properly. See also #6747. Or am I missing something?
Problem is in isWithinBoundaries function:

  // Tests whether a number is within the endpoints, without testing
  // whether it is a member of the sequence (i.e. when step > 1.)
  private def isWithinBoundaries(elem: Int) = !isEmpty && (
    (step > 0 && start <= elem && elem <= last ) ||
    (step < 0 &&  last <= elem && elem <= start)
  )

this function uses Range.last function which defined as follows:

  override def last = if (isEmpty) Nil.last else lastElement

and lastElement function have following definition:

  final val lastElement     = start + (numRangeElements - 1) * step

and numRangeElements have following definition:

  final val numRangeElements: Int = {
    if (step == 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("step cannot be 0.")
    else if (isEmpty) 0
    else {
      val len = longLength
      if (len > scala.Int.MaxValue) -1
      else len.toInt
    }
  }

so if length of Range object > scala.Int.MaxValue it returns -1

and lastElement will be calculated as start + (~~1 ~~ 1) * step and this equals (step = 1) to start - 2

I propose to use Range.end instead of Range.last in the isWithinBoundaries function
isWithinBoundaries returns true if the number is between the start and the last element. It does not check that the number is a **part** of the Range. This is the expected behavior as far as I understand.
