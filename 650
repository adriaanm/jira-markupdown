Thanks for the quick response.

However, unfortunately, I’m still seeing the problem:

* No, it is supposed to be “scalac-net” in the example. The point is that plain “scalac” (i.e. compiling to JVM) works fine, but “scalac-net” (i.e. compiling to MIL) breaks, on the same source code.

* I first of all removed the Unicode character from the source code, so that it's plain ASCII. Still get the same problem.

* I tried replacing mscorlib.dll with the mono/2.1 and then the mono/1.0 versions of mscorlib.dll. Doesn't help. Exactly the same stack trace.


Any ideas? As far as I know there isn’t anything particularly weird about my installation. Home directory is mounted on NFS. That’s the only thing I can thing might be different from any other Leopard/iMac setup. In case it’s relevant, JVM is 1.5.0_13-b05-237.
