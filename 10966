Section 6.3 of the spec explains how anonymous functions are type checked:

{quote}
The type of the anonymous function is scala.Functionn[S1, ..., Sn, T ], where T is the packed type (ยง6.1) of e. T must be equivalent to a type which does not refer to any of the formal parameters xi .
{quote}

The expansion to an anonymous subclass of {{FunctionN}} is only mentioned as the evaluation model:

{quote}
The anonymous function is evaluated as the instance creation expression
new scala.Functionn[T1, ..., Tn, T] { def apply(x1: T1,...,xn: Tn): T = e
}
