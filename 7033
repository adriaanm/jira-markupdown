Eugene recently opened this as scala/bug#5302.  See my comment there; this will be easy to fix one way or another, I only need to understand why/how this situation arises:

  type C = lub(A, B)
  !(A <:< C)

Doesn't the definition of "lub" require that to be true? Both that ticket and this one lead to situations where it isn't.
