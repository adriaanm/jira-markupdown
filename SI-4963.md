val x = ArrayStack[Int] // Uses ArrayStack apply(elem: T*) method
When passed no elements creates ArrayStack with T[0] 
afterwards arraygrow doubles the number of elements which mean still T[0]

Not a big a deal, but minimum size of 1 needs to be insured
(extempore in [r25910|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25910]) Fix ArrayStack.growArray at boundary.

Doubling a 0-size array is still 0, that's not growing.
Closes SI-4963, no review.
