Tutorials and other external documentation and discussions would benefit from being able to link directly to a scaladoc page.  There is not currently a way to do that without losing the navigation bar to the left.

The best option would be a URL that loads the normal navigation configuration with the target page as content (and possibly a target method focused).  If that is not possible, the generated pages should include something like the "FRAMES" link from javadoc.

This is a duplicate of ticket SI-4473. Closing the older ticket, as I like the other ticket's description better.
Is a URL like like http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.StringContext not good enough?
