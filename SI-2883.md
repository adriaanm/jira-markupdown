When trying to match a NodeSeq with a Text element case the following internal compiler error is thrown:

{{Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$TypeError: too many arguments for method body%2: ()java.lang.Object}}

Example source and full debug compiler output are attached. 

This code worked fine in 2.7.7 but causes an internal compiler error in 2.8.0.r20397-b20100107020241 and 2.8.0.r20423-b20100109020145. There are potentially problems with the approach taken in the example code so it's possible it should still throw a compile error, but never an internal compiler error.

Removing the Text case or changing the code to iterate over the NodeSeq and match each individual node (as in the commented out section) allows the code to compile fine.
Probably a duplicate of SI-2310
