HashMap does not implement filter directly but defers to the generic builder-based implementation of TraversableLike. That leads to filter always creating a completely new map instead of reusing the old set where possible.

An implementation for filter has already been provided for HashSet in scala/bug#6196. Since HashSet is a very similar data structure this implementation can be reused almost verbatim.
