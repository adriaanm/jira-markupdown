Instances of scala.collection.parallel.mutable.ParHashSet and scala.collection.mutable.HashSet, declared as val, are expected to produce the same behaviour when calling ++= method on them. But the following code demonstrates the difference.

```
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import scala.collection.mutable.HashSet
import scala.collection.mutable.HashSet

scala> import scala.collection.parallel.mutable.ParHashSet
import scala.collection.parallel.mutable.ParHashSet

scala> val set1 = HashSet[Int]()
set1: scala.collection.mutable.HashSet[Int] = Set()

scala> set1 ++= 1 to 10
res0: set1.type = Set(9, 10, 2, 6, 1, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5)

scala> val set2 = ParHashSet[Int]()
set2: scala.collection.parallel.mutable.ParHashSet[Int] = ParHashSet()

scala> set2 ++= 1 to 10
<console>:11: error: reassignment to val
       set2 ++= 1 to 10

```

HashMap, ParHashMap and maybe other collection types behave like this as well.
(prokopec in [r25748](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25748)) Fixes #4894.

Adds Growable and Shrinkable to parallel maps and sets.

No review.
