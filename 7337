How about `sealed finally trait T` for the desired semantics.

The example warns now, with improved match warnings.

Prog in Scala calls sealed "a license to pattern match". 

But it also says, "If you write a hierarchy of classes intended to be pattern matched, simply put sealed in front of the top of the hierarchy."

That language suggests you can pattern match anywhere in the hierarchy. (That is, arbitrary expected type for the pattern.)
