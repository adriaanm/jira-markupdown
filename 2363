I think again there's nothing we can do. Here are three facts.

1. In order to make structural types work, Scala's boxed types are the same as Java's. So scala.Float gets transparently boxed to java.lang.Float.

2. We have decided against simple overloading for equality, because the result of equality might then be different under automatic boxing.

3. == on scala.Float should follow the IEEE standard, which means 0f == -0f.

Ergo, for == on java.lang.Float the same definition of equality has to hold. If you are not happy with that, you need to drop one of the three assumptions above. 

So for me it's a wontfix.
