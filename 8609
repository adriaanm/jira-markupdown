I don't see connection with scala/bug#3452. However, it's exactly scala/bug#4214. The https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/e42733e9fe1f3af591976fbb48b66035253d85b9 was meant to fix this problem but I don't understand (yet) the fix to really see what got overlooked in that commit.

I have a hard time understanding how `Erasure.javaSig` can work without considering whether method with given symbol overrides some other method. I wish javaSig documented some of its assumptions (like what kind of information does it need to take into account).

Moreover, I learnt about `Ycheck:jvm` which reports the problem:
```scala
Foo.scala:5: warning: compiler bug: created generic signature for method minBy in Bar that does not conform to its erasure
signature: <B:Ljava/lang/Object;>(TB;)I
original type: [B](b: Object)Int
normalized type: [B](b: Object)Int
erasure type: (b: Object)Object
if this is reproducible, please report bug at http://issues.scala-lang.org/
class Bar extends Foo[Int] {
      ^
[Now checking: jvm]
one warning found
```
