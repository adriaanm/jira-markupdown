This issue seems to come up every second week. This becomes more pressing as people play with various kinds of code generation or adopt Slick (and have more than 22 database columns).

There doesn't seem to be an agreement yet on how to handle this, but now there is at least a ticket.

Another ORM affected by the 22 limit is scala-activerecord: https://github.com/aselab/scala-activerecord/issues/27

Also mentioned in that issue is the play framework JSON inception.
Case classes has been fixed in #7098 from Scala 2.11.0.
