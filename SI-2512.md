scala.tools.nsc.util.hashSet.growTable() should set
{code}
used = 0
{code}
when allocating the new Array.

With the current implementation, a hashSet with 16 entries reports size 48 and has capacity 256.

With the proposed fix, it would report size 16 and have capacity 128.


Here's an example of the value of the memory saving: when attempting to compile an existing program with truck (-Xmx1312M on Win XP) I experience outOfMemoryError: Java heap space

That's a pretty titanic bug.  Look at what it did to the statistics -- uniquetypes is reporting size, I added uniquetypes2 to count what's really in there.

{code}
[scalacfork] *** Cumulative statistics at phase cleanup
[...]
[scalacfork] #uniquetypes : 2242323
[scalacfork] #uniquetypes2: 962323
{code}

Sadly no performance improvement that I can see, but maybe that's because I'm nowhere near memory bound.

I'll fix it shortly.
(reopening for extempore to consider my benchmark, which uses uniformly distributed hashCode values)

Running my attached benchmark, my suggested hashset takes 30% to 40% less time.


I used Scala 2.8.0.r19890-b20091126020351 and Java 1.7.0-ea-b76 on XP
JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -XX:+PrintCompilation -server -Xbatch -XX:CICompilerCount=1"

Replying to [comment:5 ijuma]:
> Using uniformly distributed hashCodes on their own is not enough unless one expects that to be true for the structure in question though.

If I finish up SI-2537 then it will be true, because for the big cases in the compiler what is being stored in HashSet are case classes.
The new {{AnyRefMap}} is hugely faster than this for large HashSets, but equally much slower for small HashSets.  That indicates that there is significant potential for improvement, but it's not as simple as just dropping in {{AnyRefMap}}.
[~kanielc] - No, because it's not resolved yet.
