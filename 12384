@adriaanm we ended up deleting the old method.  We didn't want to make open source users add a compiler plugin for the library.  With that said, this is a pretty painful migration step.  In 2.12, users will have essentially the same API as we exposed previously, but for 2.11 compatibility, we need to pretend that it doesn't exist.  It would be great if you could improve resolution so that you don't break backwards compatibility with 2.11 anymore.
