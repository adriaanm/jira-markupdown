```
Ordering[Double].reverse
Ordering[Float].reverse
```
min and max members are inconsistent with the other members.

```scala
   val ordering = Ordering[Double].reverse
   println(ordering.max(5, 10))
   println(ordering.min(5, 10))
   println(ordering.compare(5, 10))
```

Prints

```
   10
   5
   1
```

The same code using a reverse Int ordering would print

```
   5
   10
   1
```

This is caused by the fact that FloatOrdering and DoubleOrdering are not implemented in terms of compare, but instead override all members. However, the reverse implementation fails to reverse the min and max functions.
