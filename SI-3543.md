(Scala Compiler 2.8.0-rc3)

I'm doing JDO stuff, which makes use of nested array annotations.  While trying to figure out how to specify the necessary annotations in Scala's annotation syntax, I tried doing something like:

   @Ann(vals = new Array(new Ann(...)))

The error message I got from the Scala compiler was:

   nested classfile annotations must be defined in java; found: Array[T]

Turns out that I should have said "Array" instead of "new Array".  It took me a while to figure this out, though, because the error message was confusing.

First, because it says "must be defined in java" I incorrectly thought that maybe Scala didn't support nested annotations and that I had to write the code in Java instead.  Also, because it said it found "Array[T]", I incorrectly thought maybe Scala's "Array" type isn't the same as Java's native array type.

I think a better error message would have been one that somehow helps me figure out that "new Array" is not actually what I want to be doing.

Also, after reading a bit more about Scala annotations, it looks like "must be defined in java" probably refers to the restrictions that Java classfile annotations have.  The error message could probably be reworded to convey this better.
