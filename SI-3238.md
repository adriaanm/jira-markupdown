= Problem =
*Iterator.reduceRight()* has the following contract at the moment:

```scala
Applies a binary operator to all values produced by this iterator, going right to left.
$$willNotTerminateInf
@param  op    the binary operator.
@tparam  B    the result type of the binary operator.
@return  the result of inserting `op` between consecutive values produced by this iterator
         going right to left:
           op(x,,1,,, op(x,,2,,, ..., op(x,,n-1,,, x,,n,,)...))
         where `x,,1,,, ..., x,,n,,` are the values produced by this iterator.
@throws `UnsupportedOperationException` if this iterator is empty._
```

However, if we try to use the method we see that it provides a different behavior - *op(x,,2,,, op(x,,3,,, ..., op(x,,1,,, x,,n,,)...))*

= Current implementation =

Current implementation looks as follows:
```scala
  def reduceRight[B >: A](op: (A, B) => B): B = {
    if (hasNext) foldRight[B](next())(op)
    else throw new UnsupportedOperationException("empty.reduceRight")
  }

  def foldRight[B](z: B)(op: (A, B) => B): B =
    if (hasNext) op(next(), foldRight(z)(op)) else z
```

We can see that it uses *x,,1,,* as a seed value for *foldRight()* call and that produce behavior that differs from *reduceRight()* contract.

= Suggested solution =
We can make *reduceRight()* conform to the contract with the following implementation:
```scala
    def reduceRight[B >: A](op: (A, B) => B): B = {
      def doReduce(z: A, op: (A, B) => B): B = {
        if (hasNext) op(z, doReduce(next(), op))
        else z
      }
      if (hasNext) doReduce(next(), op)
      else throw new UnsupportedOperationException("empty.reduceRight")
    }
```
Thank you for your demonstration of the value of my having unified the Traversable and Iterator implementations under TraversableOnce.  (In other words this is already fixed, although I didn't know it was there.)

BTW your implementation (like the one in trunk before) is not tail recursive and would easily blow the stack:
```scala
scala> (1 to 10000).iterator reduceRight (_ - _)
java.lang.StackOverflowError
	at scala.collection.immutable.Range.apply(Range.scala:29)
	at scala.collection.IndexedSeqLike$$Elements.next(IndexedSeqLike.scala:54)
```
No problem anymore:
```scala
scala> (1 to 1000000).iterator reduceRight (_ - _)
res1: Int = -500000
```
