Ok. I'm now running from the command line and seeing the messages. I have a large project and it seems that **every** edit I make recompiles the entire project - even something is minor as adding an extra space into a string.

What algorithm is this code supposed to be using. If the code is just tracking import dependencies between files and recompiling every file that transitively imports the changed file, then it is probably doing the right thing. 

However in most cases a full transitive recompile shouldn't be necessary as most changes will not change the interface exposed by either themselves, or other files they depend on.


I'll try to create a really simple example...
