When the scrutinee of a match has a parametric type, and appropriate TypeTags are in scope, it should be possible to formulate a match like the following:
```scala
def f[T: TypeTag](x: T) = x match {
  case xs: List[String] => ...
  case xs: List[Int] => ...
}
```

It would be nice if that would also work with type parameters used in non-top-level positions:
```scala
def f[T: TypeTag](xs: List[T]) = xs match {
  case (s: String) :: tail =>
```

In principle the compiler should have all necessary knowledge available, but I cannot judge how difficult it would be to make this work.

Talking with Adriaan did not result in immediate dismissal, and he asked me to reference scala/bug#5143 as related.
