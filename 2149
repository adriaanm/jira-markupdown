Scalding comment.

I will then leave you and **I urge you to close my account here** as I have no wish to participate any more in a community that doesn't seem to value the input of professionals who actually put new technologies in use in the industry. My time is at least as precious as yours, as I'm not get paid for investigating scala and am doing this in overtime.

As for cases 2210 and 2219, they actually should have been left open but retyped as "language enhacements" rather than closed and left as "computer defect". I won't bother doing this anyway.
