The scaladocs for scala.collection.immutable.Set.toSet() erroneously say that this method converts the Set to a Map.
```scala
  /** Returns this $coll as an immutable map.
   *  
   *  A new map will not be built; lazy collections will stay lazy.
   */
  @deprecatedOverriding("Immutable sets should do nothing on toSet but return themselves cast as a Set.", "2.11.0")
  override def toSet[B >: A]: Set[B] = this.asInstanceOf[Set[B]]
```
