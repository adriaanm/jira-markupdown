With Scala 2.11.0-M3 (works under Scala 2.10.0):

```scala
scala> def fold[A, B](f: (A, => B) => B) = ???
fold: [A, B](f: (A, => B) => B)Nothing

scala> def f[A, B](x: A, y: B): B = ???
f: [A, B](x: A, y: B)B

scala> def x[A, B] = fold[A, B]((x, y) => f(x, y))
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : y.type (with underlying type => B)
 required: B
       def x[A, B] = fold[A, B]((x, y) => f(x, y))

scala> def x[A, B] = fold[A, B](f)
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : y.type (with underlying type => B)
 required: B
       def x[A, B] = fold[A, B](f)
                                ^
```

However, these work:

```scala
fold[Int, Int]((x, y) => f(x, y))
fold[Int, Int](f)
```

Edit: Seems to have regressed some time between M2 and M3.
Nope. Here's the Scala distro I used, though: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/106552/scala-v2.11.0-M3-200-g9f2b289.zip

You can unzip and then point SBT to it with

```scala
set every scalaHome := Some(file("/path/to/dist")))
```
@LarsL The `AbstractMethodError` is almost certainly because I forgot to do a clean build for that home-brew distribution.
