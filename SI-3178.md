```scala
object t { def foo(x: String) = x; def foo(x: Int) = x; def bar(foo: Int) = foo; bar(foo = 1) }
```

```scala
error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method foo in object t of type (x: Int)Int
and  method foo in object t of type (x: String)String
match expected type ?
       object t { def foo(x: String) = x; def foo(x: Int) = x; def bar(foo: Int) = foo; bar(foo = 1) }
                                                                                            ^
