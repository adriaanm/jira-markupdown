> Status CLOSED, Resolution Not a Bug

Perhaps one final question, if you would be so kind: if this is "as intended", what then is the *purpose* of the {{@unboxImpl@}} definition [1] in the AnyVal classes? 

If the method is not supposed to document what actually happens when unboxing takes place, what is it for?

Thanks!
