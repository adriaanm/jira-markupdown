Feature idea, paste the last thing, including what I typed:
{code}
scala> :type val i = { println("hi"); 7 }
Int
// ok, that's what I want, go ahead and do it
scala> :paste -
hi
i: Int = 7
{code}

I thought it wasn't supposed to evaluate, by the way, so maybe I'm missing something in the nomenclature:
{code}
