Feature idea, paste the last thing, including what I typed:
```scala
scala> :type val i = { println("hi"); 7 }
Int
// ok, that's what I want, go ahead and do it
scala> :paste -
hi
i: Int = 7
```

I thought it wasn't supposed to evaluate, by the way, so maybe I'm missing something in the nomenclature:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20131018-072258-54707cb450 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_25).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :type val i = { println("hi"); 7 }
hi
Int
```
