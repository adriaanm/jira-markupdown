should `$yield` and `$extends` not be allowed? Consider
```scala
scala> val `yield` = 1
yield: Int = 1

scala> val `extends` = 2
extends: Int = 2

scala> s"$yield / $extends"
res23: String = 1 / 2
```

Or do you expect that one should have to write
```scala
scala> s"$`yield`"
<console>:1: error: invalid string interpolation
       s"$`yield`"
```
(which currently issues an error message), as in
```scala
scala> s"${`yield` + `extends`}"
res24: String = 3
```
?
