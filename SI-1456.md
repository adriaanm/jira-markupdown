See attached file. This does not compile to a switch statement. It should. 
This is a little nutty so I'm just going to report these results.  Particularly fun is that LF3 doesn't work but LF4 - without the type annotation - does.
{code}
object a {
  final val LF1 : Char = 0x0A // no switch
  final val LF2 = 11.toChar   // no switch
  final val LF3 : Char = 'D'  // no switch
  final val LF4 = 'D'         // works
  final val LF5 = '\013'      // works
  
  def b(c: Char) = c match {
    case 'A'|'B'|'C' => true
    case ' ' | '\t' | LF5 => true
    case '\u21D2' => true
    case _ => false
  }
}
{code}
As a potent illustration of this, if you apply the following changes to SourceFile.scala, Scanners will generate the intended switch statement and stack usage is dramatically lessened - from a recursion depth of about 130 down to 30.
{code}
-  val LF: Char = 0x0A
-  val FF: Char = 0x0C
-  val CR: Char = 0x0D
-  val SU: Char = 0x1A
+  final val LF = '\u000A'
+  final val FF = '\u000C'
+  final val CR = '\u000D'
+  final val SU = '\u001A'
{code}
The following is enlightening:

{code}
object Foo{
  final val Thing = '3';
}

object Bar{
  final val Thing : Char = '3'
}
{code}

Observe what happens:

{code}
david@mel:~$$ fsc -Xprint:explicitouter switch.scala 
[[syntax trees at end of explicitouter]]// Scala source: switch.scala
package <empty> {
  final class Foo extends java.lang.Object with ScalaObject {
    def this(): object Foo = {
      Foo.super.this();
      ()
    };
    final private[this] val Thing: Char('3') = '3';
    final <stable> <accessor> def Thing(): Char = Foo.this.Thing
  };
  final class Bar extends java.lang.Object with ScalaObject {
    def this(): object Bar = {
      Bar.super.this();
      ()
    };
    final private[this] val Thing: Char = '3';
    final <stable> <accessor> def Thing(): Char = Bar.this.Thing
  }
}
{code}

Adding the type annotation widens the type of the private version from Char('3') to Char. This is almost certainly what's causing these things to fail to be inlined as constants and thus what's causing the switch statement to not get generated.

So it's technically not an issue in the pattern matcher. But I'd be amazed if it manifests as a problem anywhere else. 
Actually, that's bug SI-1458. :-) 

There are a whole bunch of related issues here which can stop this from working it seems. 
Consolidated under SI-2398.
