No scope completion on members imported from an object. Vals are not found at all. Methods are found, unless the import is **inside** a `def`.

This suggests that the presentation compiler mistreats imports in the Context used for completions.
```scala
object Cont {
  val myVal = 42
  def longName() {}
}

import Cont._
object T{

  def foo {
    /*!*/ // `myVal` does not show up, but `longName` does
  }
}
```
