This code says it all:
```scala

/** 
 * Tries to load a symbol for the `Foo$class` using Scala reflection.  
 * Since trait implementation classes do not get pickling information
 * symbol for them should be created using fallback mechanism
 * that exposes Java reflection information dressed up in
 * a Scala symbol.
 **/
object Test extends App {
  import scala.reflect.mirror
  val name = manifest[Foo].erasure.getName + "$class"
  val implClass = Class.forName(name)
  val symbol = mirror.classToSymbol(implClass)
  assert(symbol != mirror.NoSymbol)
}

trait Foo {
  def bar = 1
}
```

It fails at the moment for mysterious reason. Trying to investigate it.
(grek in [r25982](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25982)) Allow to load $class classes using Scala reflection.
    
Tweaked implementation of invalidClassName method
to exclude *$class clasess from the set of invalid
names. It's not exactly clear what was the intent
of this method in first place so I'm not sure if
it's the best way to fix #5176. Added test-case
that covers this issue.

Fixes #5176. Review by odersky.
