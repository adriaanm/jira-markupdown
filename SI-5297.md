Scalaxb generates client-side stubs for WSDL SOAP webservices. The Salesforce's Enterprise WSDL (7.6K LOC) causes an explosion of the xmlprotocol.scala file to become 19K LOC. A compilation fails after 45 minutes with a stackoverflow error with high memory usage. A normal compilation takes roughly 2 minutes.

See the attachment for the compiler log, generated file, and the project's build file. A standalone example can be provided if needed.
Why is it relying so heavily on implicits in *generated* code? There are 600 implicits! It looks to me like there are massive improvements available which would ease the burden on the compiler.  I doubt it's in an infinite loop: it's more likely a search space explosion which only seems to take forever.
It's definitely not an infinite loop, here's some debugging output leading up to memory exhaustion:
{noformat}
[log typer] entered value x$3117 in value $anonfun, scope-id = 1574748867
[log typer] entered value x$3118 in value $anonfun, scope-id = 1051265169
[log typer] entered value x$3119 in value $anonfun, scope-id = 1732547741
[log typer] entered value x$3120 in value $anonfun, scope-id = 1178152283

The iterator code is correct (not sure how that's related to the topic at hand) as the part you summarized as "..." includes "&&".
Inspired by sjson and sbinary etc., scalaxb generates plain case classes and XML data binding "type class" instances separately.

I used to implement fromXML and toXML in companion objects before, but switching to type classes has repaid many times over.

h4. clean interface

{code} 
trait ApiFaultable {
  val exceptionCode: generated.ExceptionCode
  val exceptionMessage: String
}

case class ApiFault(exceptionCode: generated.ExceptionCode,
  exceptionMessage: String) extends ApiFaultable
{code} 

Notice there's no mention of XML here. This is easier to wrap the head around.
{code}scalaxb.fromXML[ApiFault](xml){code} works the same way {code}scalaxb.fromXML[Int](xml){code} works.

h4. customizability

The type class pattern also allows ad-hoc polymorphism.
Suppose the generated parser combinator parses something like {code}Order(Address("x", "x"), Address("x", "x"), 2){code}

The user is stuck with this structure, which is ok. Since type class is resolved at the call site, user can customize XML output of _any_ of the types appearing in the expression {{Order}}, {{Address}}, {{String}}, and {{Int}}.

Yes, taking this approach puts some burden on the compiler. It's been able to take the load for many of the generated code until now. Given the size of the code, I don't think 600 implicits are that insane. Shouldn't the compiler scale to handle any number of implicits linearly?

(Let me know if this is not the appropriate forum to discuss this)

I can't explain the iterator code simply; but it is fine.  The long stack trace and stack exhaustion is from the chaining of iterators with ++, and it would be interesting to know where that chaining is originating - but compile.txt tells me nothing.

> Shouldn't the compiler scale to handle any number of implicits linearly?

Short of some pretty impressive theoretical breakthroughs which overturn most of modern mathematics, I think it's unlikely.  Regardless, we should stick to talking about what the compiler does do, not what it should do.  It isn't just the number of implicits you define in that file: you have thousands and thousands of gratuitous implicit conversions taking place, and then expect the types to be inferred.  It's going to take way longer than necessary even in the best case.

Grzegorz, looks like a useful test case when improving performance of implicit search.
