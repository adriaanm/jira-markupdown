(In r22710) closes SI-3582: typedTypeDef needs to run in a new typer for TypeDefs with type parameters

this was honored when typedTypeDef was called by typed1, but other callers did not
this would cause higher-order type parameters to be re-entered in the scope of a method or a class

(by the way, should we recycle scopes for higher-order type params? now new scopes are created, symbols entered, and tree's symbols updated)

changed some spurious vars to vals
