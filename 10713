This has been raised before and discussed on the mailing lists.

The compiler can't rule it out in general. For example, this program is valid:

{code}
scala> val f: Int => Int = (a: Int) => if (a < 0) 0 else f(a - 1)
f: Int => Int = <function1>

scala> f(45)
res0: Int = 0
{code}

We do have a list of check's that we'd like to incorporated into a lint checker, and I'll add this one.
