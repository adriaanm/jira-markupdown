It seemed that by indexOf( x) you meant a call to list.indexOf( x), which for the last element in List("a","b","a") also returns 0, because that's what list.indexOf("a") does. :-)

Anyway, I should have looked at the nightlies. Much better. Still not 100% correct, IMHO:

{code}
returns    a list containing the elements greater than or equal to index from extending up to (but not including) index until of this list.
{code}

It's not the *elements* that are "greater than or equal" but the *indexes*. How about this:

{code}
returns    a list containing the elements of this list with indexes greater than or equal to from and extending up to (but not including) until.
{code}
