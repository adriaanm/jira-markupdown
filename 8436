7:scala.[[scala.collection]] and its subpackages contain a collections framework with higher-order functions for manipulation. Both [[scala.collection.immutable]] and [[scala.collection.mutable]] data structures are available, with immutable as the default. The [[scala.collection.parallel]] collections provide automatic parallel operation.
11:  - scala.[[scala.actors]] - Concurrency framework inspired by Erlang.
12:  - scala.[[scala.io]] - Input and output.
13:  - scala.[[scala.math]] - Basic math functions and additional numeric types
14:  - scala.[[scala.sys]] - Interaction with other processes and the operating system.
15:  - scala.util.[[scala.util.matching]] - Pattern matching in text using regular expressions.
16:  - scala.util.parsing.[[scala.util.parsing.combinator]] - Composable combinators for parsing.
17:  - scala.[[scala.xml]] - XML parsing, manipulation, and serialization.
25:Some of these identifiers are type aliases provided as shortcuts to commonly used classes.  For example, `List` is an alias for scala.collection.immutable.[[scala.collection.immutable.List]].
