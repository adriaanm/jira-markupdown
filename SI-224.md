scaladoc could ideally include only the first sentence of a def or val or inner class comment in the summary section.

This is a useful approach from Java that the scaladoc tool could adopt.

http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/
"The first sentence of each doc comment should be a summary sentence, containing a concise but complete description of the API item. This means the first sentence of each member, class, interface or package description. The Javadoc tool copies this first sentence to the appropriate member, class/interface or package summary." ... [defines end of sentence]




In the example below, d detail and v detail and C detail appear in the summary sections for Scala docs while they do not for Java.

```scala
abstract class A {
    /**
     * d summary.
     * <p>
     * d detail.
     */
    protected def d() {}

    /**
     * v summary.
     * <p>
     * v detail.
     */
    protected val v = 0;


    /**
     * C summary.
     * <p>
     * C detail.
     */
    protected class C {}
}
}
```

```scala
$$ scaladoc A.scala
$$ cat A.scala | 
  sed -e "s/abstract/public abstract/g" | 
  sed -e "s/def/void/g" |
  sed -e "s/val/int/g" > A.java
$$ javadoc A.java
```
