The following Java file, Comment.java:

```scala
/**
 * /*
 */
class Comment { }
```


compiles with javac (version 1.6.0_21).

The Scala file, Comment.scala: 

```scala
/**
 * /*
 */
object Comment { }
```


fails to compile with scalac (version 2.9.0.r23024-b20100917144430)
with error message:
Comment.scala:2: error: unclosed comment
  /**
  ^
one error found


```scala

```
Ok, nested comments. I actually had the following:

```scala
/**
 ....
 *   &ltpattern&gt/helloworld/*&lt/pattern&gt
 ....
 */
```

where the inner start-of-comment was a path element.
It did not occur to me that nested comments were
support (though, thinking back, I now remember reading
about them ... oh well).
