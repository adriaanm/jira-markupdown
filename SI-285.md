// example due to Jamie Webb -- thanks to Miles Sabin for clarifying further

this works as expected:
```scala
case class Key[X](v: X)
case class Value[X](v: X)

class PolyHashMap {
    private val m = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[Any, Any]

    def apply[A](k : Key[A]) : Value[A] =
        m(k).asInstanceOf[Value[A]]

    def update[A](k : Key[A], v : Value[A]) : Unit =
        m(k) = v
}

val m = new PolyHashMap

m(Key(1)) = Value("1") // error
```

this does not work as expected:
```scala
case class K[+X](v: X) // note the covariance (if you make these invariant, it works ok)
case class V[+X](v: X)

class PolyHashMap[Key[_], Value[_]] { // invariant
    private val m = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[Any, Any]

    def apply[A](k : Key[A]) : Value[A] =
        m(k).asInstanceOf[Value[A]]

    def update[A](k : Key[A], v : Value[A]) : Unit =
        m(k) = v
}

// K, V's covariance should be "masked out" since Key and Value are invariant in their type param
val m = new PolyHashMap[K, V]

m(K(1)) = V("1") // no error! -- type inference should look at signature for variance, not in type arg
```


what expected: same error in both fragments, instead no errors is emitted in second one
I think this bug is invalid.

PolyHashMap is parameterized on the type constructors.  K and V are covariant.  So it is perfectly valid for it to infer "Any" for the type parameter to update.  This is true regardless of the variance in PolyHashMap's definition, because a K[X] is a K[Any] for all possible X, and a V[X] is a V[Any].

  If you specify the type for the call to update, you get the expected error:
```scala
m.update[Int](K(1), V("1"))

./b.scala:33: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("1")
 required: Int
  m.update[Int](K(1), V("1"))
                        ^
one error found
```
If you place a bound on update which falls above the lub, it will fail as expected:
```scala
def update[A <: AnyRef](k : Key[A], v : Value[A]) : Unit = m(k) = v

./b.scala:35: error: inferred type arguments [Any] do not conform to method update's type parameter bounds [A <: AnyRef]
  m(K(1)) = V("1") // no error! -- type inference should look at signature for variance, not in type arg
  ^
one error found
```

If you are suggesting that the compiler should fail to compile the code even though it is well-typed, then I think there's a much higher burden of proof necessary than that shown in this ticket.  So, closing.
