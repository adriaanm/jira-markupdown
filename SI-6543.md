Since this is due to SI-3295 (the stack overflow is in List#foldRight) perhaps martin will reconsider the wontfix status of that ticket.

After reading the discussion on SI-3295, I'd like to add a bit of context re: what itch this script scratches.

I have been using scala (quite successfully, thank you) as my primary scripting language for the last 2 years.
There are only a couple of remaining significant limitations that force me to solve a few problems without using scala:

1. scala needs the ability to carry its' own data (the role of "here-documents" in most scripting languages).   

2. although not related to this ticket, it's still quite difficult for a stand-alone scala script to know where it resides in the filesystem

Both of these features are necessary for a scala script (and/or equivalent executable jar file) to be distributed as a single file, placed anywhere in the filesystem, and executed without a wrapper (e.g., a bash script).

The failing script referred to here was generated via the command line 'find tmp -type f | xargs cksum > listItems.sc', after which I intended to quickly convert the output to a script that permits duplicate files (those with equal cksum in column 1) to be reported.  Due to the length of the list and the foldRight limitation, I haven't figured out how I might resolve this (without resorting to ruby).

Feature #2 is a trivial operation in mainstream scripting languages, and although it is possible in scala, the solution is quite ugly: see 'showScript.sc', attached).

FYI it is easy to modify that bit of Typers not to use foldRight, which will make this issue go away. But I'd like to use the fact that the compiler itself fell prey to the foldRight behavior to also fix SI-3295.  My point though is that this will be fixed regardless.
I get a similar error when running a program using a big Map object defined in source code.
Code:
{code}
object ChiSquareAlpha
{
  val ChiSquareToAlphaIndexTable = Map(
    1 -> Array(0.00016,0.00063,0.00393,0.01579,0.06418,0.14847,0.45494,1.07419,1.64237,2.70554,3.84146,5.41189,6.63490,10.82757),
    .. 9998 other entries ..
    10000 -> Array(9673.95,9711.71,9768.53,9819.19,9880.79,9925.36,9999.33,10073.68,10118.82,10181.66,10233.75,10292.58,10331.93,10442.73)
  )

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(ChiSquareToAlphaIndexTable(9999)(0))
  }
}
{code}

With Scala 2.10 (target jvm-1.6) and oracle-jre-bin-1.7.0.21 (same result with jre-1.6.0.45) under 64 Bit Linux:
{noformat}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: bm/statistic/ChiSquareAlpha$

I'll attach source file ChiSquareAlpha.scala to reproduce it. 
Hope that helps to fix the bug.
