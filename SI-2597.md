I'd like to see the following two methods be added to Option:

    def notEmptyAnd(f: A => Boolean) : Boolean    
    def isEmptyOr(f: A => Boolean) : Boolean

Basically I think this would markedly improve readability of some code. I currently have (this is a real piece of code):

  bt.chain.forall { bID => 
    ft.chain.find(_.isSameType(bID)) match {
      case None => true
      case Some(fID) => fID.partialID == bID.partialID
    }
  }

This could be simplified as: 

  bt.chain.forall { bID => 
    ft.chain.find(_.isSameType(bID)).isEmptyOr(_.partialID == bID.partialID)
  }

I believe that this offers much more clarity than the various alternatives
Something similar was discussed here:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala/17686

where it was (mostly) agreed that it would add clarity to be able to do something like this:

`v ifDefined foo otherwise bar `

where v is an Option. I suggested 'ifDefined' because of its symmetry with 'isDefined'.
what's wrong with

```scala
v map {x => foo} getOrElse bar
```
You are exactly right - however it does not convey the Boolean "predicate" nature of what is going on. I find that I write an awful lot of code which looks like:

  api.find(k).map(passesSomeTest(_)).getOrElse(true)

or also

  api.find(k).map(passesSomeTest(_)).getOrElse(false)

The intent of the code is not very clear (esp. when it is nested in other closures). Much more readable as:

  api.find(k).notDefinedOr(passesSomeTest(_))

and
 
  api.find(k).isDefinedAnd(passesSomeTest(_))

Just because something is equivalent does not mean that it is more readable. I believe that testing via predicates is a common and special case which warrants bespoke methods such as these to clarify meaning. For example:

  coll.forall(test(_))

is just equivalent to 

  coll.dropWhile(test(_)).isEmpty
