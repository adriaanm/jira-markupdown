It is unfortunate that the "optimised" Stream.flatMap
can call the supplied function twice for each element of the Stream.

Here is a contrived example:
{code}
// previously took 1 second and printed 2, now takes 6 seconds and prints 4
var count = 0
Stream.range(0, 2).flatMap(n => { Thread.sleep(1000 * count); count += 1; List(n) } ).length
println(count)
{code}

Here's a better implementation:-
{code}
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Iterable[B]): Stream[B] = {

    // drop A's for which f yields no B
    def loop(s: Stream[A]): Stream[B] = {
      if (s.isEmpty)
        Stream.empty
      else {
        val i = f(s.head)
        if (i isEmpty)
          loop(s.tail)
        else
          i.toStream append loop(s.tail)
      }
    }    

    loop(this)
  }
{code}


Note that I used i.toStream because I haven't verified any benefit in matching on Stream or List to avoid the virtual .toStream call. 

There's a separate avoidable .toStream virtual function call within flatMap's use of append (as flatMap always passes a Stream to append) and it isn't expensive (perhaps less than 1% impact on flatMap's performance).
