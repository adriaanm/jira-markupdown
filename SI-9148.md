#9006 added a more visible link to a class/trait/object's companion. Along the same vein, the tooltips for these links to companions should be explicit as to where they are linking to. So, instead of a blanket "Go to companion", they should add the type they are going to:


- Go to companion object
- Go to companion trait
- Go to companion class
