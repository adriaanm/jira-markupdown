Suppose we have the following Java source file:

{code}
package example;

public class Example {
}
{code}

And suppose we also have the following Scala source file:

{code}
package object example {
	def Example() = new Example()
}
{code}

If we compile like this:

{code}
$$ scalac -sourcepath . example/package.scala
./example/Example.java:3: error: Example is already defined as method Example
public class Example {
             ^
one error found
{code}

But if we compile like this:

{code}
$$ scalac -sourcepath . example/package.scala example/Example.java
{code}

â€¦it works fine.

This behavior does not appear to be intentional.
