At page 100, chapter 12 _Computing with streams_ there is presented the following code block :

{code:language=scala}
range(1000, 10000) filter isPrime at 1
{code}

I didn't find the operation _at_ between the operations of _List_ type and I am wondering if the code block shouldn't actually look like :

{code:language=scala}
range(1000, 10000) filter isPrime apply 1
{code}
