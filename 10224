Ok. I think it might be solved with solution 4) by introducing a new kind of a leaf node to Ctrie called LazyNode, that holds a lazy value initialized only once instead of a strict SNode. So seems doable, but not sure if it's worth it - there might be other `ConcurrentMap` implementations in the future, or wrappers around concurrent maps from elsewhere, and seems to me that those will never work without hacking the implementation of the thing being wrapped.
