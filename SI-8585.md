I wrote a small program to test the performance between Iterator#size and count the size manually by while(hasNext). The second one is about 3x faster which surprise very much. I think getting size of an iterator is a very basic function and we don't need to do it manually. My scala version is 2.10.3
How do you obtain the iterator? `size` is an abstract method in `GenTraversableOnce` and also has no default implementation in `Iterator`.
size comes from TraversableOnce and uses internal iteration:

```scala
  def size: Int = {
    var result = 0
    for (x <- self) result += 1
    result
  }
```

It would probably make sense performance-wise to override it in Iterator for external iteration.
