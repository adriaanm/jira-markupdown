Scala's parser combinator library doesn't have an analogue to the 
EVNF "except symbol" - from the ISO standard for EBNF (14977), where
```scala
p - q
```

accepts if the left hand side accepts and the right hand side rejects.

Adding support for it would make it easier to translate EBNF notation 
directly into parser combinators. As far as I can tell, this would be 
simple, as:
```scala
p - q == not(q) ~> p
```

A proposed patch against r15798 is attached.
