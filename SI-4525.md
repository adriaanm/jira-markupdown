=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
import scala.xml._

class Test {
  val e: Elem = null
  val ns: Seq[Node] = null

  // if you comment this, the last line compiles
  e.map(i => i)
  
  // there's an implicit from Seq[Node] -> NodeSeq (which has a method 'text')
  ns.text
}
{code} 


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Successful compilation.


=== What do you see instead? ===

{code}
bug-2.scala:11: error: value text is not a member of Seq[scala.xml.Node]
  ns.text
     ^
one error found
