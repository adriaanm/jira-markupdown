The docs of BigDecimal say the following:

"Within the range of IEEE binary128 numbers, BigDecimal will agree with BigInt for both equality and hash codes (and will agree with primitive types as well)."

In some cases in Scala 2.11 this does not appear to be the case. The following example shows this regressing from 2.10 to 2.11:

2.10
```scala
scala> BigDecimal(123.312).hashCode()
res0: Int  -1903704720

scala> (123.312).##
res1: Int = -1903704720
```

2.11
```scala
scala> BigDecimal(123.312).hashCode()
res0: Int = 342240935

scala> (123.312).##
res1: Int = -1903704720
```

It might be that this was simply dropped as a feature of BigDecimal. That would break some applications and it would be good to update the docs at least with a warning.
