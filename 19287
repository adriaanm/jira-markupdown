Trying to compile the following code using scala2.11.2 and scalatest-2.2.1 gives me the attached error stacktrace. (Same behaviour in scala-2.10.4 and scalatest-2.2.0). Everything works as expected after either
- extracting the "new FakeLocalDate" to a val,
- or taking out "with DiagrammedAssertions".

{code}
class PossibleScalacBug extends FunSpec with DiagrammedAssertions {
  it("returns 42 as the total count") {
    assert(StubRepository.totalCountFor(new FakeLocalDate(2014, 8, 8)) == 42)
  }
}

object StubRepository {
  def totalCountFor(unusedDate: FakeLocalDate): Int = 42
}

class FakeLocalDate(year: Int, month: Int, day: Int)
{code}
