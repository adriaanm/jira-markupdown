If we try to create a new class and in the package field we specify a package that does not exist the class creation fails and an error gets displayed inside the editor.

It would be great if instead of the aforementioned behavior the wizards would automatically create the missing package. The wizards can create a missing package since they have all the information they need (package name and source directory). Also this behavior is consistent with JDT.

Tested with r20979.

(In r21002) Some improvements to new wizards. Fixed #3110. Thanks to Tim Clendenen for the patch. Review by community.
