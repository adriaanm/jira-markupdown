This seems an unfortunate property for an immutable object. 
{noformat}
scala> case class Foo(x: Int, xs: Int*)
defined class Foo

scala> val x = Foo(5, 10, 15)
x: Foo = Foo(5,WrappedArray(10, 15))

scala> x.xs.asInstanceOf[collection.mutable.WrappedArray[Int]].array(0) = 123

scala> x
res0: Foo = Foo(5,WrappedArray(123, 15))
{noformat}

The behaviour isn't any different from {{ case class Foo(x: Int, xs: collection.Seq[Int]) }}, I'm not so sure it's a big problem. Or if it is deemed a problem, it's not exclusive to case classes -- they don't have exclusive rights to immutability.

Maybe there is a place for a lint check on this.
Okay, you're proposing to wrap in an immutable structure when varargs are provided. But the caller can still pass {{mutableSeq : _*}}, so you don't have any guarantee about immutability.

This reminds me a bit of the lead up to 2.8 when {{hashCode}} for case classes rejected mutable {{Seq}}-s.

If anyone could do this:
{code}
  def f(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = { xs.tail = List(-1, -2, -3) ; xs }
{code}
would that be a problem? I suggest the answer is "yes, obviously." So what is the difference, other than that list is more widely used?

Think of f above as a library function (possibly the standard library) and the user of that library function as someone with a passing concern in security and data integrity.  (Only a passing concern, not a serious concern, which is in any case de facto excluded for reasons beyond this one.)
And don't forget it's not just Array which compromises varargs but any mutable Seq.
{code}
scala> case class Immutable(xs: Int*)
defined class Immutable

scala> val xs = scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer(1, 2, 3)
xs: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2, 3)

scala> def f(xs: Seq[Int]) = Immutable(xs: _*)
f: (xs: Seq[Int])Immutable

scala> val x = f(xs)
x: Immutable = Immutable(ListBuffer(1, 2, 3))

scala> xs ++= 1 to 10
res1: xs.type = ListBuffer(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

scala> x
res2: Immutable = Immutable(ListBuffer(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10))
{code}
This is a different idea of mutability than Scala has.  (Rust has this idea.)

That is, in Rust, mutability is a property of the *context*.  If you are in a mutable context, you can mutate things.  If you are in an immutable context, you can't.  If you stick a mutable thing into an immutable context, you can't mutate it any more.  (Conversely: if you stick an immutable thing into a mutable context, you can mutate it.)  There are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach.  It lowers surprise when you wield the system intentionally, but it makes it difficult for you to really protect something from mutation.

In Scala as it stands, mutability is a property of the *field* and therefore you get cases where immutable fields hold mutable objects and vice versa.  This is just one example of this sort.  Option(Array(1,2,3)) is another.

I do think it's bad that X* doesn't have a very clear type, so you can be thinking "immutable" and yet get a mutating version handed to you.  Personally I would just disallow X* in case classes, or think of some more robust fix.  If you want a vararg in your case class to make it seem like the case class can take an arbitrary number of parameters, you'll be have a bit of a rough ride:

{code}
scala> case class C(a: Int, xs: Int*)
defined class C

scala> C(1,2,3)  // toString doesn't match what we type
res0: C = C(1,WrappedArray(2, 3))

scala> C(1, List(2,3): _*)  // Wrapped type leaks through
res1: C = C(1,List(2, 3))

scala> res0 match { case C(a,b,c) => 1 + 2 + 3; case _ => 0 }  // Can match 3 args!
res2: Int = 6

scala> res0.productArity  // Wait, what?
res3: Int = 2
{code}

Not having a sensible copy behavior leaves you with partially incomplete case classes.  Having a feature that adds behavior you can't get anywhere else, but which breaks your typical use cases, is less clear of a win than if you keep all typical use cases.
Here's what 2.10 does:

{code}
scala> case class C(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int)
defined class C

scala> C(1,2,3).copy(4,5)
res0: C = C(4,5,3)

scala> case class D(a: Int, xs: Int*)
defined class D

scala> D(1,2,3).copy(4,5)
<console>:10: error: value copy is not a member of D
              D(1,2,3).copy(4,5)
{code}

If this is something with a natural fix, then great.  But if it doesn't have a natural fix, maybe the privileged position of varargs in case classes is less of a win than we think.
This sort of works, but I'm not sure it follows the principle of least surprise (and it can't completely get around the default args vs. varargs limitation):

{code}
scala> case class D(a: Int, bs: Int*) {
     |   def copy(a: Int = this.a): D = new D(a, bs: _*)
     |   def copy(a: Int, bs: Int*): D = new D(
     |     a,
     |     (if (bs.length < this.bs.length) bs ++ this.bs.drop(bs.length) else bs): _*
     |   )
     | }
defined class D

scala> D(1,2,3)
res11: D = D(1,WrappedArray(2, 3))

scala> res11.copy()
res12: D = D(1,WrappedArray(2, 3))

scala> res11.copy(4)
res13: D = D(4,WrappedArray(2, 3))

scala> res11.copy(4,5)
res14: D = D(4,ArrayBuffer(5, 3))

scala> res11.copy(4,5,6,7)
res15: D = D(4,WrappedArray(5, 6, 7))
{code}
