In r20097 I did a necessity-inspired patch to avoid NPEs on a map containing null keys.  I asked philipp what the policy is supposed to be and he said:
{code}
In general, we have to allow null keys in maps. Enforcing that keys are
non-null should be done using non-null type checking, which is not available
short-term. Therefore, we should make maps and hash tables deal with nulls if   
at all possible.
{code}
In that case that needs to be documented, and all the map methods should be reviewed to ensure they are doing the necessary checks.
