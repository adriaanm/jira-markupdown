My point is that once the floating point inaccuracies are fixed, scala/bug#8518 will magically work also; and an anchor point is not really the best way to solve them anyway, since you still have inaccuracies in our output (you just cope with them internally).

I don't think the 2.12 branch has been created yet.  Just hang on until it is, I guess, and then rebase and submit against that branch.  But I think I'm going to have to fix the inaccuracy problem anyway.  I haven't quite figured out yet what is possible without breaking compatibility.
