Scaladoc can determine the relative source path for a symbol if -sourcepath is defined and use that to link to the source.  However, -sourcepath has unintended side effects and can break compilation.  (See [this thread|http://www.scala-lang.org/node/10494].)  Scaladoc should instead use its own -doc-sourcepath option.  Alternatively, what is currently called -sourcepath should be renamed and hidden behind -X as suggested in the thread.
Fixed in [94db9d983c](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/94db9d983cdd28c053e568b6185fe2494bd7ffec). 
EDIT: When using scaladoc, `-sourcepath` bootstrapping is disabled, thus there's no need for a new name. Keeping the same name avoids breaking existing scripts or having to remove deprecated members in a future release.
