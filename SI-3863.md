Scaladoc has JavaScript based incremental search for finding packages, classes, objects and traits. But current implementation is not fast.

I think the issue is caused by DOM access. So I made a patch to fix this.

With my patch, Scaladoc generates index of packages, classes and so on. And {{textFilter()}} scan the index before DOM manipulation.
