= problem =
When using the REPL, deprecated methods/classes can only be noticed after using them.

{code}
warning: there were 1 deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
{code}

= analysis =
It would be better if deprecated methods would be recognizable in tab-completion and in usage/while typing.

= enhancement recommendation =
Options to display deprecated methods/classes more clearly could be:
 - A "strike-through effect"
 - Some coloring (related to SI-4223)
 - Some marking like appending "(d)" in the tab completion 

If that would work, it might be possible to consider dropping the "warning after usage" when running scala without "-deprecation"
