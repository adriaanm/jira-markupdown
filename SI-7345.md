As noticed while fixing SI-7319:

     - encapsulate the error/warnings buffers in Contexts, and
       only expose the minimal representation necessary to propagate
       these between contexts, filter, and issue. This should fix
       a number of places where buffered warnings are not treated
       correctly (these were added recently, but places like `withSavedContext`
       were not updated.)
     - bring order to other menagerie of state within Context.
       It might be simpler and safer to carry it around in a nested
       case class, so we could use the 'copy' method to selectively
       modify one or two fields.
What about [SI-6149|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6149]
related question:

Most of the time, Typers uses {{context.makeNewScope}}, which calls {{newNestedScope(scope)}}. Howeve, the context created to type check a template (in typedClassDef and typedModuleDef) is created using {{context.make(.., .., newScope)}}, i.e. a non-nested scope. (Namers is equivalent).

I have no idea why this distinction is made, anybody who has could add a comment to the source code :)
