Unlike, say, annotations or flags, knownDirectSubclasses doesn't get auto-populated and requires a symbol to be pre-initialized to work correctly.

{code}
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.reflect.runtime.{currentMirror => cm}

sealed class C
class D extends C
class E extends C

object Test extends App {
  val c = cm.staticClass("C")
  println(c.knownDirectSubclasses)
  c.typeSignature
  println(c.knownDirectSubclasses)
}
{code}

{code}

Test case for compile time reflection in SI-7588
See another test case at https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8776
[~moors] can you elaborate on "this is not something we can fix due the way the typechecker is implemented" ... are there any specific obstacles you have in mind?
1) Since this is a design issue, do scala.meta and/or Dotty change things here? I wonder if we need a label like `redesign` for such issues.
2) [~milessabin] the design issue is mentioned in the discussion links, in particular in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/LRfKffsPxVA/db_jmsa7FO4J:

> knownDirectSubclasses relies on a full top-down pass having been completed before you call it.
>
> Technically, we could provide a onTypecheckCompilationUnit that you could use, but this isn't currently planned for the macro api (well, I'll let Eugene comment on that, but I'm not aware of any plans here -- in any case, 2.11 is in ramp down)

Could the following be used as workaround in some case (seems to work in my case as far as I can see).

{code:java}
val cls: ClassSymbol = sub.asClass

println(s"knownDirectSubclasses = ${cls.knownDirectSubclasses}")
// print "knownDirectSubclasses = Set()"

val subsub = cls.owner.typeSignature.decls.filter {
  case c: ClassSymbol =>
    cls != c && c.selfType.baseClasses.contains(cls)

  case _ => false
}

println(s"subsub = $subsub")
// print the actual sub classes
{code}
Fix backported to 2.11.8 is available [here|https://github.com/typelevel/scala].
