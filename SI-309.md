The user misunderstands what sourcepath does. As in JavaC, it merely provides a root from where to find dependent source files (given their class names), it doesn't cause the compiler to do anything. The behavior as-is is correct as the user has not specified anything to compile.  
Source files is required parameter?

So usage line should be

`Usage: scalac <options> <source files>`

instead of:

`Usage: scalac <options | source files>`
Adjusted the description of usage to be 

```scala
scalac <options> <source files>
```

which is also the same as `javac`.
