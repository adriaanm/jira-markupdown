If you want to find the 'pow' method, for example, and you don't know where it is, you might go to the method index (i.e. the a-z index underneath the search field in the left frame).  You click on 'p' and then look for 'pow'.  You won't find it - ScalaDoc doesn't put members of package objects into this index.

Also:

Another thing which I realized while browsing through the index is the way in which the index entries are written, i.e. are capitalized.
Example: STAR: is defined in Trees.Star, Base.Star and Tokens.STAR, but listed in the index as STAR only. Probably all defined capitalizations could be listed on the index-title-line instead of only one (arbitrarily) chosen one. (noticed by Dominik)
Btw Vlad, I just looked at it-- in html/page/Index.scala, members of the package objects don't seem to be included in `pack.templates` (which is what's filtered and ultimately makes up the list of entries to be shown in the index pages): https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/page/Index.scala#L64

So even if you ask for packages to be included in the filtered results, still no members of package objects show up.
Can you come up with a small test case that I can use to debug it? I couldn't reproduce on trunk, the following example shows all members: package object Hello, object A and B:

```scala
package object Hello {
  object A
  object B
}
```
There's an example in nightly.

See [scala.collection.parallel.package](http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.collection.parallel.package). Note the method `setTaskSupport`.

Then, navigate to the "S" index page: http://www.scala-http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#index.index-s

There's no `setTaskSupport` method listed.
Vlad, you sure that methods don't appear in the index? `map` certainly does: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#index.index-m
This issue is a bit trickier that it looks. The way the index is built, each DocTemplateEntity's members are added to the index, as long as the member's owner is the DocTemplateEntity in question (http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/compiler/index.html#scala.tools.nsc.doc.model.IndexModelFactory$).

Normally, the owner of a member is the template it is defined in, and this is computed with the makeTemplate function (by using the owner of the symbol of a member), where it will normally find a correspondence. In the case of a member of a package object, however, it seems that the owner of such a member does **not** correspond to the package, but to a generic symbol having the name "package"

TL;DR the symbol table does not seem to map owners correctly for members of package objects, so the issue seems to be during symbol table generation.
Another thing which I realized while browsing through the index is the way in which the index entries are written, i.e. are capitalized.
Example: STAR: is defined in Trees.Star, Base.Star and Tokens.STAR, but listed in the index as STAR only. Probably all defined capitalizations could be listed on the index-title-line instead of only one (arbitrarily) chosen one.

Now I hear that you're working on this bug, @manojo, if that's the case, unassigning it was my mistake! (Otherwise leave it unassigned, to better reflect reality, that's my take on it).
Closed by the model rewrite in [c11427c1](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/c11427c1).
