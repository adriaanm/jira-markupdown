Just to add that I recently made some modifications to immutable.ListSet and immutable.ListMap in order to make them behave in a more consistent way. Initially I tried to to make the immutable.ListSet iterator provide the elements in reverse order for performance reasons, but I was forced to do the other way around as it seems the compiler depends on the current iteration order of ListSet for some things. That's the reason why `toList.reverseIterator` was kept there. The PR is https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5103.
