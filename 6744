Ok, thank you, that wasn't obvious.
However maybe such syntax should be removed (I think 1d is enough)
For example, why these two calls are different?
```scala
class RichInt {
  def +++ = 1
  def foo = 2
}
implicit def i2r(x: Int): RichInt = new RichInt
1.+++
1.foo
```
So 1.id should be call to Int id, or should be Doudle id call in both cases.
