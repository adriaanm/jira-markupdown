If a file contains import statements when we fold the first all the code between the first and the last import statement (including class definition etc) gets folded.

See the attached screen-shots.



Thanks for the comment. It looked like it might be desirable to have a custom folding structure provider because {{org.eclipse.jdt.ui.text.folding.DefaultJavaFoldingStructureProvider}} seems closely tied to Java language structure and sooner or later we might find it unsuitable for Scala. It might also be difficult to work around this Java coupling by just overriding 
{{protected void computeFoldingStructure(IJavaElement element, FoldingStructureComputationContext ctx)}} 
because {{FoldingStructureComputationContext}} is inaccessible from Scala code -- or at least I can't find a way to access it.

Anyway, I'll be happy to look at solving this using multiple {{ImportContainers}} -- another learning opportunity!
Hi Maciek,

thanks for submitting the patch. I tried to start development for SDT a couple of weeks ago but every time I write any Scala code I usually end up submitting bugs instead. SDT has improved a lot since then (thanks Miles) I might give it a try in the future.

One of the problems of SDT for new developers is that it has a steep learning curve since it depends on JDT and on scalac internals. My strategy for starting the development was to first work on UI stuff and then move on to other parts that require deeper knowledge.

IMHO one area that could use some improvement are the Scala wizards "New {Project,Class,Object,Trait}" (for example see SI-2682). If you want to start submitting patches then improving the wizards might be a good way to start.

BTW the Groovy plug-in reuses the Java wizards for Groovy you might want to do the same for Scala.
I've opened SI-2685 that also includes pointers to the relevant code in the Groovy plugin.

I do not have the time to do this now and I don't know if Maciek would like to implement it. My original comment was a proposal on how he could start contributing to SDT.
Thanks for the encouragement :) I guess I'll continue with this ticket since I have already spent some time trying to understand how the folding is done and now have a clear suggestion from Miles on what to try. I'll have a look at SI-2685 next.
Import folding take two: https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/attachment/ticket/2554/mm-folding-091126.patch

Multiple {{ImportContainers}} seem to do the job. I still feel like stabbing in the dark when modifying the code though so won't be surprised if it turns out I made the changes in exactly the wrong place.
(In r19962) Fixed SI-2554.
