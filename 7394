Diggory Hardy: if you want "the right type" for `while (true)`, you should use such code instead of `while (true)`:
```scala
def whileTrue[T](p: => T): Nothing = {
  while(true) {p}
  sys.error("The impossible happened!") //Returns Nothing
}
def foo: String = whileTrue { return "" } //minimal use case, works
```

Sorry for the spam, but there was no other place to answer. To discuss further, please post a link to your question on scala-language (or on Stack Overflow).
