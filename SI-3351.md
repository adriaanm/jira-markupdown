Which looks silly.
Example:
http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.html

Notice the space after the period of the first paragraph
"[...] elements of type ."

Also notice how "version" and "since" are formatted:
{code}
version 2 . 8
since 1 . 0
{code}
Not sure if that's the same bug.
