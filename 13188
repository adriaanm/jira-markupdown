The interpreter admits the subject line as input, but it shouldn't.  The reason is because the following code compiles:
```scala
  object Foo {
    println "Hello, world"
  }
```
Either this should not compile, or the interpreter needs to insert something at the beginning of its object wrappers to avoid this trap.  I am not sure why it compiles, though.  It compiles equivalently to this:
```scala
  object Foo {
    println ; "Hello, world"
  }
```
Is that intentional, or is the parser getting confused when it thinks "println" might be a this alias for the template?
