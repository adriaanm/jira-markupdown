Yes, it appears that the the implementation of `unbox` is now never used. This might have happened when we switched to the new GenASM backend. I'd have to check with Miguel to be sure.

Here is where the backend chooses the `unboxToInt` implementation:
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/GenASM.scala#L1298
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/GenASM.scala#L2485

In that case, your suggested patch looks innocent and essentially just documentation.
