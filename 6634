```
% cat a.scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Hello, world!")
  }
}
% scalac291 a.scala 
% scala291 -J-Xmx256M HelloWorld
Hello, world!
```
You'll have to supply evidence it's not something in your environment.

There is a bug, which is that "scala HelloWorld -J-help" should be passing -J-help to HelloWorld rather than grabbing it for the JVM.
