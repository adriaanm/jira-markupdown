Looking up method `corresponds` in scala.collection.Seq, I see two entries, one of them without documentation, but with a @bridge() annotation. That entry should be suppressed, as should all other entries that carry @bridge annotations. Java generated bridges are not shown in docs, so neither should manually annotated bridges.
(heathermiller in [r25677|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25677]) Scaladoc now hides members with @bridge annotation, contributed by Simon Ochsenreither. Closes SI-4924
