If it's scala/bug#3452, very likely it's workarounded by ~~Xverify (with a backend respecting it ~~ currently it's GenASM, it used to be GenJVM): -Xverify detected and discarded invalid generic signatures, avoiding the problem (while reducing precision of type signatures, of course).
I even had a pull request enabling that check by default.
