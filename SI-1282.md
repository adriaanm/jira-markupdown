It seems that some ant tasls depend on the current classpath. If classpath is set, errors, or (worse) wrong tests result. Ant builds and tests should be the same no matter whether classpath is set or not.
build.xml has this:
```scala
  <property name="build.sysclasspath" value="ignore"/>
```
which is supposed to make ant ignore the classpath.  I'm going to presume this is fixed, but if it's not, I don't think it can be fixed without more detail about what doesn't work right.
