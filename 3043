This worked for me.

I followed the instructions except I did 'sbt update compile'.  I got the failure during icode that you mention, so I commented out compileOptions.  I then got a successful compilation.

I tried with both the Nov. 29 snapshot that is the project default and the latest nightly snapshot (Dec. 7).
