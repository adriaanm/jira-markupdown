Entering the following in the REPL,

{code}
if (true) {
  null.asInstanceOf[collection.mutable.Seq[Int]]
} else {
  null.asInstanceOf[collection.mutable.Set[Int]]
}
{code}

will fail to compile with the error

{code}
<console>:10: error: type arguments [Any] do not conform to trait Cloneable's type parameter bounds [+A <: AnyRef]
       val res0 =
           ^
{code}

I would expect that some valid upper bound should be found. There is no problem with the immutable collection types, nor a combination of immutable and mutable collections.

The issue was reported on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7155066/adding-to-scala-map-within-for-loop-and-conditional-statement
For my reference, this is another example of inferred types not conforming to bounds.
Note the "with scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable[Any]" despite Cloneable's AnyRef bound.
{code}
scala> lub(List("Set", "Seq") map (intp types "scala.collection.mutable." + _) map (s => typeRef(NoPrefix, s, List(ObjectClass.tpe))))

res22: $r.intp.global.Type = 
  scala.collection.mutable.Iterable[java.lang.Object] 
  with java.lang.Object 
  with Int => Any 
  with scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable[
    scala.collection.mutable.Iterable[java.lang.Object] 
    with java.lang.Object 
    with Int => Any 
    with scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable[
      scala.collection.mutable.Iterable[java.lang.Object] 
      with java.lang.Object 
      with Int => Any 
      with scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable[
        scala.collection.mutable.Iterable[java.lang.Object] 
        with Nothing => Any 
        with scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable[Any]
      ] {
        def seq:  scala.collection.mutable.Iterable[java.lang.Object] 
                    with Nothing => Any 
                    with scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable[Any]
        }
    ]
  ]
{code}


Assigning to meeting because I know how to fix it and I hate to not do so on the basis that I can't address every imaginable case.

(extempore in [r25650|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25650]) Refine lub calculation.

When a reasonable lub cannot be arrived at by direct means,
use the bounds of the lub inputs to derive bounds for the lub
rather than giving up.  Closes SI-4938, review by moors.
