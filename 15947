The code
{code}
class Boo(a: Int = 0)

object test {
	class Boo
}
{code}
causes an assertion to get thrown by sbt when it analyzes the compiler output. It wants to call companionClass on the outer Boo class.

I don't understand much of this, but  it looks like the flatOwnerInfo.decl call ends up putting both Boos in the resulting set, which makes it look overloaded which causes the assertion in suchThat to fire.

Running against 2.8.1 (though the sbt ticket says it was tried against a 2.9 snapshot.) I looked at the current code.
