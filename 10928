Thanks for looking at this. This exists only in a topic branch in my repo:

{code}
git clone https://github.com/pwendell/spark.git
cd spark
git checkout 7fb13b21864ac030ae3bd09d0a4262bdb5bf66f3
sbt/sbt compile # works
sbt/sbt doc # compile fails
{code}

By the way - that build will be 2.10.3. I tested 2.10.4 also and it also failed, so I reported that in the issue since it's the most recent version in which I saw a failure.
