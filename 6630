A correction: I discussed `WrappedArray` before, but your example will actually wrap the `Array` inside `ArrayOps`, so one should consider that code as well - including the multiple manual specialization of `ArrayBuilder`. It seems that all `ArrayBuilder` specializations already has a specialized implementation of `++=`, so adding the `sizeHint` to `SeqLike` could be enough.
