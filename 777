Actually, this seems to be working fine in the latest builds of the plugin.  It is worth noting though that I use Buildr to generate the project fully formed with multiple source dirs, I never really test with a purely plugin setup anymore.

Anyway, this bug could be closed as "fixed" buy it's up to you guys.  Works for me! :-)
