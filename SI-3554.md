I had a really confusing time today when a build suddenly stopped finding a bunch of classes. It had me zapping my maven repo, cleaning builds, zapping ivy and all kinds of crazy stuff. I couldn't see why all of a sudden Scala seemed to not find a bunch of classes which were really inside some jars and were found previously.

It turned out that by changing a version dependency I'd moved to using a different scala compiler version to the one used to build one of the dependent jars (2.8.0.Beta1 v 2.8.0.RC3).

Given how scala is so brittle to different scala compiler versions; it would be good if scala would generate a warning if it found a mismatch between the currently active scala compiler version versus the scalac version used to build dependent jars. Not sure if the bytecode includes a scalac compiler version though, does it?

I can see many folks hitting this -getting random class not found errors and scratching their heads & randomly zapping maven repos and stuff, when really its just a mismatch of 1 jar being built with the wrong version of scala





library version compatibility is something for build tools to solve
similarly for the compiler version: the build tool should serialize this in the artifact and detect incompatible versions

Don't assign it to poor overburdened community - this is the worst kind of ticket to assign to  abstract people, because it's 0% code to write and 100% decision to make.  It is very easy to do it, and nothing past the compiler can do it with the accuracy the compiler can.  Making use of the information is indeed something we can push out to the build tools, but they can't use something they don't have.

See also SI-6802.

We might want to record the full compiler version, and the required version of the library. (A library could be compiled with 2.10.1, but we could certify that it only requires the 2.10.0 library.)
Since 2.11.0-RC1 is one week away, pushing all non-blockers without PR to 2.11.1-RC1. Please undo the change if I missed work in progress.
