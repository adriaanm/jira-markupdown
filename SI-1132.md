The following code

{code}
var x = 0
x += n
{code}

produces this error message:
{code}
error: value += is not a member of Int
{code}

It would be better if it could state that `n` is not defined.

However:
{code}
var x = 0
x += ""
{code}

gives the same error message. Some information of the expected type of += would be nice as a well as a hint that += might be rewritten in terms of + and =.
