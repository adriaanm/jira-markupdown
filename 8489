For anyone looking to fix this, the situation is captured by my comment in Constructors:
```scala
      /** XXX This is not corect: remainingConstrStats.nonEmpty excludes too much,
       *  but excluding it includes too much.  The constructor sequence being mimicked
       *  needs to be reproduced with total fidelity.
       *
       *  See test case files/run/bug4680.scala, the output of which is wrong in many
       *  particulars.
       */
```
Specifically, "remainingConstrStats.nonEmpty excludes too much." I wouldn't expect any fixes to delayedInit though, certainly not from me.
