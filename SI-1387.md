In my attempts to get a more scala friendly library for Hadoop, I've
come across this in ScalaRuntime

84        def _hashCode(x: Product): Int = {
85          var code = x.getClass().hashCode()
86          val arr =  x.productArity
87          var i = 0
88          while (i < arr) {
89            code = code * 41 + x.productElement(i).hashCode()
90            i += 1
91          }
92          code
93        }
94

Sadly, x.getClass.getHashCode doesn't seem to be consistent across
different machines or different executions (not sure which), which
makes it useless in Hadoop, since Hadoop assumes that hashCode is the same no matter the machine. Any chance we could get this changed?

How about:

var code = x.productPrefix.hashCode();

or var code = x.getClass.getName.hashCode() ?
