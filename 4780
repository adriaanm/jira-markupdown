Don't jinx me bub.  I see the similarity, but scala/bug#2551 is far more ambitious: I'm not looking to overload anything or have the compiler do anything clever, just to chill out about stomping the entire build.  I'd be happy with any number of tiny changes, I'd take a compiler option, hidden secret password and handshake, anything which uncripples the described use case.

Plus I'll gladly implement it myself.  I am not scala/bug#2551! (You are scala/bug#6.)
