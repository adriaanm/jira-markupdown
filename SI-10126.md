Given source code that contains a `@compileTimeOnly` annoataion: https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/enableIf.scala/blob/544f2c4/src/main/scala/com/thoughtworks/enableIf.scala

The generated Scaladoc become duplicated `@compileTimeOnly( ... ) @compileTimeOnly( ... )`: https://static.javadoc.io/com.thoughtworks.enableIf/enableif_2.12/1.1.4/com/thoughtworks/enableIf.html
It's indeed a bug in the scalamacros plugin, that I fixed in this PR:
