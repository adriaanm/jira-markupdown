=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala

object Test extends Application {

  def exec( op: => Unit = ()) {
      java.awt.EventQueue.invokeAndWait(new Runnable {
        def run() { op }
      })
  }

  // USAGE 1 (results in correct behaviour)
  exec( () ) // explicitly pass a parameter, _identical to the
             // default_ -> no problems
  println(1) // (prints '1' as expected)

  // but USAGE 2 results in hang
  exec()     // no parameter to let the default-value be used; 
             // UNEXPECTED: THIS CAUSES A HANG!
           
  println(2) // (I never saw the '2'; process still running)

}
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
```scala
output:
1
2
<process exits>
```


=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
output:
1
<process 'hangs'>
```

=== Additional information ===
None.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: Scala 2.8.1.final
  - Java: SDK 1.6.0 update 23
  - Operating system: Windows Vista Business SP2
Oops! It seems to be the Application trait. My fault!

It stripped it one little step further, and it works when I don't use the Application trait but run it in the main() method. This must have something to do with (mis-)use of static initialization by the Application trait (quote from API):

----
"In practice the Application trait has a number of serious pitfalls:
Threaded code that references the object will block until static initialization is complete. However, because the entire execution of an object extending Application takes place during static initialization, concurrent code will always deadlock if it must synchronize with the enclosing object.

Static initializers are run only once during program execution, and JVM authors usually assume their execution to be relatively short. Therefore, certain JVM configurations may become confused, or simply fail to optimize or JIT the code in the body of an object extending Application. This can lead to a significant performance degradation."
----


The hang seems to be on a call to Object.notify(), so indeed synchronization problems.

So my wrong to be using the Application trait!

It remains interesting that the two semantically identical constructs have different effects. This might be caused by  the Scala compiler optimizers? Or JIT/Hotspot, who knows. So I guess the ticket can be closed.

Sorry!

*The code running fine using regular main method:* 
```scala

object Test2b {
	
  def main(args: Array[String]) {  
  
	  def exec( op: => Unit = ()) {
	      java.awt.EventQueue.invokeAndWait(new Runnable {
	        def run() { op }
	      })
	  }
		  	  
	  // USAGE 1 
	  exec( () ) 
	  println(1) 
	
	  // USAGE 2
	  exec()     // equivalent call as previous 
	  println(2) 
          
          // (CORRECT BEHAVIOUR, NO HANG)
	  
  }
}

```
