It has to be a bug? Oh well I also must have the record for "Not a Bug", like how home run records can be accompanied by strikeout and walk records.
{code}
package bob

// The expected behavior
object util {
  import scala.util

  class Random { override def toString = "bob's random "}

  object Test {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = println(new util.Random)
  }
}
// a.scala:11: error: reference to util is ambiguous;
// it is both defined in package bob and imported subsequently by
// import scala.util
//       println(new util.Random)
//                   ^
// one error found
{code}

This one however compiles, and when run indicates that package util was successfully shadowed.
{code}
package bob

package util {
  import scala.util

  class Random { override def toString = "bob's random "}

  object Test {
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = println(new util.Random)
  }
}
{code}
