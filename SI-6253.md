HashSet does not implement union. That means that creating the union of two sets is very inefficient. Adding a large set to a small set creates the entire set anew.

```scala
scala> val a = Set.empty[Int]
a: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set()

scala> val b = Set(1,2,3,4,5)
b: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val c = a union b
c: scala.collection.immutable.Set[Int] = Set(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> c eq b
res0: Boolean = false
```

c is a completely new set even though it contains the exact same elements as b and could therefore be eq b.

Clearly this is not good. A set should have the most efficient possible implementation for intersection and union. The implementation of filter for set (#6196) allows for a fast intersection. The missing operation union is already implemented in HashSet as merge. So all that needs to be done is to adapt the merge algorithm of HashMap to HashSet.
I disagree with RÃ¼diger on the fact that c should be equal to b in the previous example, given that eq is the pysical equality, not the verification that the content is the same. Nevertheless, there is indeed a major performance issue on Set. I'm using the mutable version of HashSet, and here is an example snippet :
```scala
def grade: Double = {
  val setA: HashSet = // get from somewhere else
  val setB: HashSet = // get from somewhere else
  if ((setA size) == 0 || (setB size) == 0) return 0
  else return (setA & setB size) / (setA | set B size)
}
```
This piece of code is repeated a lot of times in a loop, and the entire loop is executed in around 4.5 sec.

But when I replace the union with somethin else...
```scala
def grade: Double = {
  val setA: HashSet = // get from somewhere else
  val setB: HashSet = // get from somewhere else
  if ((setA size) == 0 || (setB size) == 0) return 0
  else return (setA & setB size) / ((setA size) + (setB size))  // just a gross approximation for testing purpose
}
```
... then the execution time goes down to around 0.35 sec.

So, I think this is a faulty behavior and should be corrected.

As a quick patch, I used size(A) + size(B) - size(A intersect B), but this only works because I just want the size.
I just wanted to let you know that I am working on additions to HashSet to implement all set operations (union, intersection, diff and subsetOf) as bulk Tree/Tree operations. This gives a pretty significant speedup in many cases, especially when the objects in question have an expensive hashCode and equals implementation. 

Unfortunately Josh Suereth told me that right now is not a good time to get this included to the scala library, since they are very busy with getting 2.10 out of the door. I managed to get a few small improvements in, but the bulk operations will have to wait. 

@Simon: you are requiring union (|) and intersection (&). The bulk union operation would take care of making union as fast as possible. So maybe write a ticket for intersection? 

Regarding the eq thing: as a general rule, whenever you call a method on an immutable collection that returns an object that is equal to the original object, you should try to *return the original object* whenever this is possible without changing the asymptotic complexity. There are some operations where this is not possible, but for the set operations on HashSets it should always be possible! I even have a dedicated test for that in my HashSet improvements.

val x1 = x.someOp(...) // if(x==x1) then x1 should be eq to x!
