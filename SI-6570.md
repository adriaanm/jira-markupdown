Seq pointing to collection.Seq is very dangerous, because it enables mutability leaking into an otherwise immutable API. It is very dangerous, because the "Scala story" is that all collections that one can use without import are immutable. Even very experienced developers don't know or simply forget that Seq just aliases collection.Seq, which means one could easily pass a mutable Seq or Array for a parameter annotated with Seq. 

See the scala-internal mailing list for more details ...
Additionally we should also redirect the following:

  type Traversable[+A] = scala.collection.immutable.Traversable[A]

  type Iterable[+A] = scala.collection.immutable.Iterable[A]

  type IndexedSeq[+A] = scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[A]
