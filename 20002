For Scala's immutable maps

{code:java}
m + (p, q) // two map entries as vararg
{code}

appears to be three orders of magnitude slower than the functionally equivalent

{code:java}
m + p + q // separate map entries
{code}

and

{code:java}
Seq(p, q).foldLeft(m)(_ + _)
{code}

Ready to run as micro-benchmark.
