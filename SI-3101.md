On Windows, where line.separator is \r\n, the scala compiler 2.8.0.Beta1 converts the platform newlines in multiline strings to \n.

This is wrong.

Steps to reproduce:
Create nl.scala with:
```scala
println("""
""".getBytes.length)
```
Make sure it has Windows line separator \r\n.

scala-2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease:
```scala
scala nl.scala
1
```

Expected results (scala 2.7.7):
```scala
scala nl.scala
2
```

I was also able to reproduce this also with scala-2.8.0-20100214.025735-327 (latest from maven snaphots repo).

Specs way to reproduce:
```scala
"""
""" must_== "\r\n"
```
Note you can force the windows line separators in file from SVN by setting the *svn:eol-style* property to *CRLF*.
Sorry, you are right. But this is no issue with Windows at all. This happens in linux exactly the same.

I'll restate the problem: In 2.8 the Scala compiler handles newlines in multiline strings specially: The character sequence "\r\n" is replaced by "\n". This changed from 2.7 which IMO showed the correct behaviour: Multiline strings could contain any characters and were converted verbatim on the character-level into a string constant.

The Scala langugage reference says:
```scala
Characters must not necessarily be printable; newlines or other control characters are also permitted. Unicode escapes work as everywhere else, but none of the escape sequences in (ï¿½1.3.6) is interpreted.
```
