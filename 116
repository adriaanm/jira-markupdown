I think it's worth pointing out that this behavior is not common in many mainstream languages.

Here's Python:
```scala
>>> "" + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
```

Here's Ruby:
```scala
irb(main):001:0> "" + 2
TypeError: can't convert Fixnum into String
	from (irb):1:in `+'
	from (irb):1
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
```

And in languages where it is, it's given as a bad example. I think Java folks can learn to appreciate a lack of implicit conversion to string, especially given that they don't need it with string interpolation.
