First of all, mind blown with {{throw null}}, hadn't seen that done before :-)

Although I'm happy to use {{final}} as a work-around, I'm not sure I fully understand why {{final}} semantics obviates the need for an outer instance. Is that because a non-final nested can be extended outside outer? Or what's the scenario here?
