These show that the compiler knows that a wildcard is not a valid identifier in accordance with the spec:

```scala
scala> def _ = 3
<console>:1: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
       def _ = 3
           ^

scala> class _
<console>:1: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
       class _
             ^

scala> val _ = 3
<console>:5: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
  lazy val $result = _
                                          ^
<console>:10: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
 + "_: Int = " + scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.replStringOf(_, 1000)
                                                                              ^
```

However, scalac complains about multiple bindings to _ :
```scala
scala> { val _ = 3; val _ = 5; 7 }
<console>:8: error: _ is already defined as value _
              { val _ = 3; val _ = 5; 7 }
                               ^
```

This was reported on a mailing list a while ago (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/7159), but never filed as an issue.  One improvement since then:

```scala
scala> { val _ = 3; `_` }
<console>:1: error: wildcard invalid as backquoted identifier
       { val _ = 3; `_` }
                    ^
```
Also from the world of poorly chosen ways to put _ to work is
```scala
object Test {
  def f[_](x: Int) = x      // compiles
  def g[_, _](x: Int) = x   // fails
  // ./a.scala:5: error: _ is already defined as type _
  //   def g[_, _](x: Int) = x
  //            ^
  // one error found
}
```
According to Scala Language Specification, {code} { val _ = "foo"; val _ = "bar" } {code} should be treated as valid , because `_` is not a simple identifier but a pattern. 

In Scala Language Specification 4.1 Value Declarations and Definitions
```
If p is some pattern other than a simple name or a name followed by a colon and a type,
then the value definition {{val p = e}} is expanded as follows:
```

```
3. If p has no bound variables:
{code}
e match { case p => ()}
{code}
```


In Scala Language Specification 1.1 Identifiers
```
The following names are reserved words instead of being members of the syntactic class id of lexical identifiers.
{code}
abstract case catch class def
do else extends false final
finally for forSome if implicit
import lazy match new null
object override package private protected
return sealed super this throw
trait try true type val
var while with yield
_ : = => <<:
<% >: # @
{code}
```

However, salac should never accept {code} { def _ = "foo"; def _ = "bar" } {code}.
