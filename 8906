I was very close to fixing this issue in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3452, but in the end I decided against it, because just flags are unlikely to be enough.

When creating flags based on someone else's flags it is oftentimes necessary to negate some bits or to only obtain a subset of those bits - something that's currently not available in the API, and exposing all that stuff on the verge of https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6267 seems a bit too much.

If you feel that you need flags in the public API, please speak up - I will be glad to re-evaluate the "won't fix" given strong evidence.
