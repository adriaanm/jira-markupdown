=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
scala> case class Baz()
defined class Baz

scala> val baz = Baz()
baz: Baz = Baz()

scala> baz.copy()
<console>:11: error: value copy is not a member of Baz
       baz.copy()
           ^ 
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The copy method should exist.


=== What do you see instead? ===
The (less than useful) copy method is missing. 

=== Additional information ===
I checked ï¿½5.3.2, but it doesn't mention any exceptions except a copy method already existing, so why does the compiler forget to create the copy method here? 

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24516-b20110320020044
The compiler is doing the right thing. 

A case class with non-empty value params gets a compiler-generated copy method: 
   http://www.scala-lang.org/node/2075

A case class with no value params get no copy method, as it would duplicate clone() functionality:

All right, the spec does not mention in Sec. 5.3.2 that no-args case classes don't get a compiler-generated copy method. 

Asking Lukas for comments (about clarifying this in the spec).
