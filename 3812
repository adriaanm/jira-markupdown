Another question.  The original checkfile you checked in for t3224 had your own path embedded in it:
```scala
/home/odersky/workspace/scala/test/files/neg/t3224.scala:29: ...
```
Are you sure this worked before? I'm skeptical because there are 671 checkfiles in trunk and 0 of them have the string "odersky" in them.  (There is one actually, shootout/message.check, but it has no corresponding test so it's not used.)
