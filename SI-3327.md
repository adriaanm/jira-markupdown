The following simple program

{code}
object Main {

    def main (args : Array[String]) {
        val b = new StringBuilder
        b.append ("Hello World!")
        b.lastIndexOf ('e')
        println (b.toString)
    }

}
{code}

prints out

{code}
!dlroW olleH
{code}

when compiled and run with Scala 2.8RC1 (on Mac OS X and Java 1.6).  Everything is fine with 2.8Beta1.

Apparently the lastIndexOf call causes the contents of the builder to be reversed as a side-effect.

Whoa man, calling reverse on StringBuilder reverses the target.  That is a gross violation of the "reverse" contract.
{code}
  /** Returns new $$coll wih elements in reversed order.
{code}
If StringBuilder wants to inherit from Seq that method must change.
(In r21672) StringBuilder no longer violates the Seq reverse contract: it
returns a new StringBuilder.  The behavior formerly found in
reverse (updates in place) is now available in reverseContents.
Migration warning on reverse.  Closes SI-3327.

Also did some StringBuilder rewriting as per discussion with
odersky.  And took a cleaver to parts of the documentation to
get to the good parts a little faster.  Review by community.
