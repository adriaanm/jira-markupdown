The following code compiled with 2.10-M2
```scala
import scala.collection._
import generic.CanBuildFrom
trait LongTraversableLike[+A, +Repr <: LongTraversableLike[A, Repr]] extends TraversableLike[A, Repr] {
  override def toArray[B >: A: ClassManifest] = super.toArray
}
```

but it doesn't with 2.10-M4:
```scala

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

import scala.collection._
import generic.CanBuildFrom
trait LongTraversableLike[+A, +Repr <: LongTraversableLike[A, Repr]] extends TraversableLike[A, Repr] {
  override def toArray[B >: A: ClassManifest] = super.toArray
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:10: error: No ClassTag available for A
         override def toArray[B >: A: ClassManifest] = super.toArray
```
That's because the signature of toArray changed (from ClassManifest to ClassTag in the context bound.) This is a violation of deprecation policy.  The original toArray has to be retained for 2.10 to adhere to the rules.  And you can't overload them at present:
```scala
<console>:10: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method f1 in class Bippy of type [T](implicit evidence$2: ClassManifest[T])Int
and  method f1 in class Bippy of type [T](implicit evidence$1: scala.reflect.ClassTag[T])Int
match expected type ?
              res0.f1
                   ^
```
But that should be fixable with different implicit placement.
I think the way Manifests got refactored was meant to preserve source back-compatibility. The ClassManifest inherits from ClassTag:
```scala
trait ClassManifest[T] extends OptManifest[T] with ClassTag[T] with Equals with Serializable
```
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/252a44864786b6832b9da4c29d1ac9aad48c4291/src/library/scala/reflect/ClassManifest.scala#L26

Apparently, something went wrong with this approach but I cannot see what.
You didn't understand me.  ClassTag is in a parameter type in the method signature of toArray now.  You are trying to override it with a method which takes a ClassManifest parameter instead.  You can no more do this than you can override "def f(x: Traversable[Int])" with "def f(x: List[Int])".  The implicit conversions are of no use.  The parameter types must match.
Oh yes, I can see it now. Annotating the code with return type reveals the true problem Paul refers to:
```scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

import scala.collection._
import generic.CanBuildFrom
trait LongTraversableLike[+A, +Repr <: LongTraversableLike[A, Repr]] extends TraversableLike[A, Repr] {
  override def toArray[B >: A: ClassManifest]: Array[B] = super.toArray
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:10: error: method toArray overrides nothing
         override def toArray[B >: A: ClassManifest]: Array[B] = super.toArray
```

It's tricky issue because it seems like you want both ClassTag <: ClassManifest and ClassManifest <: ClassTag for different reasons.
Also Greg, you're defining a ClassManifest for B, whereas the compiler tries to calculate a manifest for type A:

```scala
[[syntax trees at end of typer]]// Scala source: Test.scala
package <empty> {
  import scala.collection._;
  import scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom;
  abstract trait LongTraversableLike[A >: Nothing <: Any, Repr >: Nothing <: LongTraversableLike[A,Repr]] extends AnyRef with scala.collection.TraversableLike[A,Repr] {
    def /*LongTraversableLike*/$init$(): Unit = {
      ()
    };
    override def toArray[B >: A <: Any](implicit evidence$1: ClassManifest[B]): <error> = LongTraversableLike.super.toArray[A]()
  }
}
```

How was that supposed to work?
Re deprecation, as I indicated up top you can overload them.  The question is whether the implicits will be ambiguous.  I think the ambiguity can be evaded.

As to it trying to find a manifest for A, it looks like something is breaking down during its confusion, and it winds up inferring A as the type argument to toArray.  It makes no sense, and if you write super.toArray[B] the error is more to the point.
Eugene, can we get fix for this issue in master soon? This is a blocker for me as mentioned here:
