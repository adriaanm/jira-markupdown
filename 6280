Ascription helps pick the correct apply:
{code}
My((Seq(1, 2): Seq[N[Int]]):  _*)  // "seems to work"

// But not the implicit you probably expect. You get:
My(Seq(anyToN(1), anyToN(2)): _*)
// instead of
My(seqToN(Seq(1,2)): _*)

// In the overtly erroneous case, it decides on:
My(anyToN(Seq(1,2): _*))
{code}
The difference in behavior begins with the overloaded apply; it rejects apply(String) and grabs onto the conversion Int=>N and doesn't let go.
