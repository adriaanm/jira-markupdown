```scala
trait Universe {
  type Symbol >: Null <: AnyRef with SymbolApi
  trait SymbolApi

  type FreeTypeSymbol >: Null <: FreeTypeSymbolApi with Symbol
  trait FreeTypeSymbolApi extends SymbolApi

  implicit class CompatibleSymbol(sym: Symbol) {
    def asFreeType: FreeTypeSymbol = ???
  }
}

object Test extends App {
  val u: Universe = ???
  import u._

  val sym: Symbol = ???
  sym.asFreeType
}
```

```scala
21:43 ~/Projects/palladium0/sandbox (topic/palladium0)$ s
Test.scala:18: error: value asFreeType is not a member of Test.u.Symbol
  sym.asFreeType
      ^
one error found
```
This is a change in behavior in comparison with 2.10.x (regression?).

FreeTypeSymbol is now designated as volatile, which prevents: 1) pattern matching against vals of such type, 2) extension methods that return such type. If I change `FreeTypeSymbolApi with Symbol` to `Symbol with FreeTypeSymbolApi`, it makes everything work fine, but then erasures of Symbol and FreeTypeSymbol start clashing.

I have several questions actually:
1) Is the change in volatility correct? FreeTypeSymbol transitively extends AnyRef, so why is it volatile?
2) Why do we disregard extension methods that return volatile types?
I opened #8301 on this a few moments before I saw this one. Marking this as a duplicate.
