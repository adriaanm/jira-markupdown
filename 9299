This issue is really different from SI-7278. Here class E is only used to force name expansion to make private def x that is visible according to scala lang, accessible at runtime by JVM.
Now why a single separator, rather than the name of the non-class owner is enough:
The conflict is caused by inadvertent overriding with
{quote}
    val foo: D = {
    class D extends C.this.D {
    ...
{quote}

This is possible because it's possible to reference D in outer scope. It's impossible to reference
{quote}
    val foo: D = {
    class D extends bar.D {
    ...
{quote}

in scala since this means referencing a virtual class, and scala doesn't have them.
