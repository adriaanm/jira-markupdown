Because Range uses the inherited foreach method from RandomAccessProjection it ends up being slower than it needs to be.

This patch adds a custom foreach implementation to Range which appears to run about three times faster than the existing one, thus handily making it only 25 times slower than the equivalent while loop. 

I've also attached a test case that demonstrates that it does the right thing.
Thanks for your patch.

I have applied it (with only minor lexical changes) in r15954. The test file has been added in r15955.
