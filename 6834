Coincidentally, I was just looking at this, because of similarity to a previous bug fix, perhaps.  I was guessing transformNamedApplication is confusing lambdalift, based on the weird renaming of the term.

It's not flaky or hard to reproduce, so it seems assailable.

I also have to catch up on the last few episodes of Fringe.
