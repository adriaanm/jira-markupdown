```scala
$ cat test2.scala
package test.scaladoc {
  /** @groupname Z New name for Z */
  package object groups

  package groups {
    trait A {
     /** @group Z */
      def z = 0
    }
  }
}

$ scaladoc test2.scala -d doc -groups
model contains 5 documentable templates
```

The result is that def z won't inherit the "New Name for Z".

**Note: Bug prevents proper reflection documentation. It was already fixed as part of the reflection docspree.**
