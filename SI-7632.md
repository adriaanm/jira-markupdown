...so that I can require a Map.WithDefault as a parameter when I know I need one.

Currently, the methods have type immutable.Map instead of immutable.Map.WithDefault.
Yes, they have brittle semantics.  Really brittle: 

{code}
Map(1 -> "fish", 2 -> "dish").withDefaultValue("wish").filterKeys(_ > 1).apply(3)
{code}

does not return "wish".  Anyway, it can't sensibly be fixed by returning Map$WithDefault; you have to rework the hierarchy.  An enhancement request is fine, but I don't see this going in before 3.0.  If you need there to be a default, you have to insist on it with your own wrapper.
*nod*  That makes sense.

As a work-around, I've been using lenses that embed a default, instead relying on Map's .withDefault / .withDefaultValue.
