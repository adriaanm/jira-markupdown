A previous trick of splicing the lines (the else is erroneous but is not erroneous when spliced to the previous fragment) was rejected because of side effects.  

The example suggests it could be revived for defs, where nothing was evaluated.
{code}
scala> def foo =
     |   if (true) 1
foo: AnyVal

scala> else 0
// Continuing with definition of `foo`

     | def foo =
     |   if (true) 1
     |   else 0
foo: Int

scala> 
{code}
The effect might be Byzantine, or miniature.
