Just for the record, it appears that a work-around for this problem is to set the jline.WindowsTerminal.directConsole system property to false. This works for JLIne examples, but doesn't work for the Scala REPL due to a bug in Scala's version of JLine (https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7061).
