When I try to compile the following program, the compiler runs out of memory after 2 minutes on my machine. Reproduced with all of the above versions. (2.9.0, 2.9.1, 2.10.0-M2). I attached a small test project, including a Gradle build script.

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.WeakHashMap
class bar{ }
class foo{
  val map = WeakHashMap[AnyRef, collection.mutable.Map[bar, collection.mutable.Set[bar]]]()

  def test={
    val tmp:bar=null
    if (map.get(tmp).isEmpty) map.put(tmp,collection.mutable.Set())
  }
}
{code}
There is a cavalcade of interesting issues illuminated by this snippet.

Your code contains a type error -- this change will make it correct: {{map.put(tmp,collection.mutable.Map())}}.

When the compiler encounters this error, it triggers an implicit search to convert `map` to a type with a suitable `put` method. Alarmingly, this search includes `JavaConversions.asJavaDictionary`, despite the absense of an import! Why, you may ask? Well, {{WeakHashMap}} extends {{JavaConversions.JMapWrapper}}, and the implicits of a nested type include those defined in its enclosing scopes (object or package object). This behaviour isn't specified, see: SI-4427. I suspect that this consequence of putting {{JMapWrapper}} in {{JavaConversions}} was unintended.

So, the compiler tries to use: 

{code}
collection.JavaConversions.asJavaDictionary(map).put(tmp, collection.mutable.Set())
{code}

This line of code, when compiled verbatim fails as one expects. The compiler infers the type argument as:

{code}
scala.collection.JavaConversions.asJavaDictionary[AnyRef, scala.collection.mutable.Map[Bar,scala.collection.mutable.Set[Bar]]]
{code}

and fails with:

{code}
error: polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : [A]scala.collection.mutable.Set[A]
 required: scala.collection.mutable.Map[Bar,scala.collection.mutable.Set[Bar]]
                collection.JavaConversions.asJavaDictionary(map).put(tmp, collection.mutable.Set())
                                        
{code}


But for implicit views, things proceed along a different path. The inferred type arguments are:

{code}
collection.this.JavaConversions.asJavaDictionary[AnyRef, <284574 characters of inferred type elided>]
{code}

No, really. I've attached said [^gargantuan-type.txt] for posterity. Unsurprisingly, the second argument to {{put}} doesn't conform. That's when {{TypeDiagnostics}} takes over and brings down the compiler.

{{TypeDiagnostics}} has the admirable intention to add just enough qualification of identifiers in type errors to make them unambiguous, while still maintaining readability. Processes each pair of types referenced in the type error, and adding qualification to those with the same name that refer to distinct types. This cartesian product is not processed lazily, and it exhausts the heap.

It seems that this work is all for nought anyway -- we just want to rule out ineligible implicit views, the carefully crafted message wouldn't make it to the user anyway.
Hey, you totally must have picked up "cavalcade" from my comment in JavaConversions.  (Not that you learned the word, but that it was on your mind.)
{code}
  // Note to implementors: the cavalcade of deprecated methods herein should
  // serve as a warning to any who follow: don't overload implicit methods.
{code}
I hadn't spotted that sage commentary -- it seems that {{JavaConversions}} itself has the capacity to inspire specific language from those it crosses. Neat.

I'm surprised it compiles once you removed the hurdle -- which implicit saves the day?
Nice moment of the day - after rewriting a core typer method and having a test failure, I sighed and took a look to find the test referenced above, with my comment:
{code}
/** It's a pos test because it does indeed compile,
 *  not so much because I'm glad it does.  Testing
 *  that error messages created and discarded during
 *  implicit search don't blow it up.
 */
{code}
Fixed as side effect of beautiful rewrite of isSameType.
