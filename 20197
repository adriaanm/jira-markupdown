In http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/01-lexical-syntax.html (as of 2016-09-17), the grammar refers to non-terminal `printableChar`.

However, neither the EBNF nor the text actually defines `printableChar`.

Although nearby text (in section 1.3.4) does refer to printable characters, it never actually specifies that non-terminal `printableChar` represents one.  Yes, it might seem obvious that that's the intent in this case, but such intent isn't always clear, and a specification should specify more explicitly.

I don't know if the specification maintainers would want to use a modified-EBNF form like:

bq.  `printableChar ::= <a printable Unicode character>`

or something textual such as "non-terminal `printableChar` represents a printable Unicode character."  (Should the verb be "produces" or maybe "maps to"?)
