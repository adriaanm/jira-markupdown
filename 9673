We generated a ValDef whose tpt TypeTree has no original; this contains a reference to the symbol for `d`. `resetAttrs` and the retypecheck assigns a new symbol for `d` and leaves a the reference to the prior symbol dangling.

I think I'll revert the fix altogether on 2.10.x, and refine it on master to only use the stable type for the named arguments if needed to conform to the formal parameter type.

The real bug is the resetAttrs concept.
