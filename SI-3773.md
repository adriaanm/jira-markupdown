The following program contains two uses of m.elements where m is a Map.  This method has been deprecated.  With -deprecation I get a warning for the first one, but not for the second.  Shouldn't both attract warnings?

```scala
object Deprecated {

    def main (args : Array[String]) {
        val m = Map ("1" -> "one", "2" -> "two")
        for (p <- m.elements) println (p)
        for ((v, t) <- m.elements) println (v)   // no warning
    }

}
```

```scala
scalac -deprecation Deprecated.scala
Deprecated.scala:5: warning: method elements in trait IterableLike is deprecated: use `iterator' instead
        for (p <- m.elements) println (p)
                    ^
