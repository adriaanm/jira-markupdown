I am using 3.5.1 on Turion 64.  I installed via Synaptic Package Manager in Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koola.  It put /usr/lib/eclipse and other directories but nothing in /bin/eclipse.  Can you tell me commands to try in order to see if it is able to function at all and if it is a problem with paths only?  File > New > Project only asks me what wizard.  I tried Java but it still only had Cancel highlighted.  Since Eclipse cannot do normal text editing much less multi-column editing, I try to use it get on to things that just work and forget commands next time I come back.
