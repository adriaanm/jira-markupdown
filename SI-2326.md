The following expression fails:

<foo bar={(new Date()).getTime} />

with the following error:

<console>:18: error: overloaded method constructor UnprefixedAttribute with alternatives (String,Option[Seq[scala.xml.Node]],scala.xml.MetaData)scala.xml.UnprefixedAttribute <and> (String,String,scala.xml.MetaData)scala.xml.UnprefixedAttribute <and> (String,Seq[scala.xml.Node],scala.xml.MetaData)scala.xml.UnprefixedAttribute cannot be applied to (java.lang.String,Long,scala.xml.MetaData)
       <foo bar={(new Date()).getTime} />

However the following succeeds:

scala> <foo>{(new Date()).getTime}</foo>
res20: scala.xml.Elem = <foo>1251993726095</foo>

And so does the following workaround (adding .toString to the embedded scala):

scala> <foo bar={(new Date()).getTime.toString} />
res22: scala.xml.Elem = <foo bar="1251994209318"></foo>
Maybe same problem as #1787.
It is a duplicate of #1787, yes.  You'd think it'd be a simpler matter to call .toString() automatically, but because of curse-inducingly poorly considered semantics, you will end up with Strings like "Some(5)" where you would currently receive "5".  The correct fix requires breaking the current interface which means it has to wait.
