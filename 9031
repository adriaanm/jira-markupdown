I have just tried to change `mutable.TreeSet` so that it uses a mutable red-black tree (added in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4504) as its underlying data structure. Everything worked well, `ant test` yields no issues and the changes seem to be source-compatible. However, as its underlying data changed, it may happen that users that serialized a `mutable.TreeSet` with a previous version of Scala will find out that its binary representation is no longer valid after such a modification (the current serialization stability tests do not include `mutable.TreeMap`).

@Ichoran, does this prevent such a change to be included in Scala 2.12? If not, I can do a pull request later.
