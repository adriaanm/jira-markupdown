Erik,
What do you mean by 'current' specialization?
One in adriaanm/partialfun branch definitely don't specialize partial functions well, as it goes only half-way (Abstract PF is specialized, but not PF itself). When I've tried to fix it, I've encountered this bug. So if the bug won't be fixed soon, I've plan to turn off PF specialization completely, as such half-specialization can be in fact even slower than no specialize at all. If this issue will be fixed in the near time, I'll try to enable PF specialization again, and maybe create a few other bugs :)
