Fixing this means that `Coll` would be inferred differently for these two signatures, which look instead equivalent:
```scala
def f[T, Coll <: Traversable[T]](p0: String)(p1: Traversable[T]): (Coll => Traversable[T]) = ??? //Here Coll would be maximized.
def f[T, Coll <: Traversable[T]](p0: String)(p1: Traversable[T])(p2: Coll): Traversable[T] = ??? //Here Coll would be minimized.
```

This is if I get the new expected behavior right, which says that (ignoring mixed variance) a type argument must be minimized (made most specific) if it appears either:
(a) *covariantly* in the result type (per 4881), hence *covariantly* in the method type or
(b) *covariantly* in argument types, hence *contravariantly* in the method type.
