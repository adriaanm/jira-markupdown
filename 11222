I just ran on the same issue. This bug was closed with the resolution "out of scope", but since the reason for this problem is a bug in a used library, why don't you just go back and use the jline version (obviously 2.11) that doesn't contain this bug in the first place until the bug has been fixed in some version 2.xx. Besides it is nice that the same bug has been posted on github/jiline2 to be fixed, but since there hasn't been any activity on this project for the last 7 months, it is very unlikely the bug will be fixed at all. 

So if there is no evident reason for scala REPL to use jline-2.12, please switch back to the working version or don't use jiline at all. Otherwise every user of scala REPL who uses keyboards with Alt-Gr key combinations will run into the same problem. Other than that simply pasting some code into REPL does not work for me when [ ] or @ is contained.
