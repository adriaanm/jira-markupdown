As can be seen in decompiled code, compiler is incerting an extra cast to Object[], which simply does not work on JVM.

The example is reduced from a large codebase and does not make much sense beyong demonstrating the problem.
```scala
object Main {
  def mkArray[T <: A](atype: Int) :T#AType = {
    (atype match {
      case 1 =>
        new Array[Int](10)
        // Decompiled code: return (Object[])new intr10;
      case 2 =>
        new Array[Float](10)
    }).asInstanceOf[T#AType]
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println(mkArray[I](1))
    //java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Object;
  }
}

trait A {
  type AType <: AnyRef
}
trait I extends A {
  type AType = Array[Int]
}
trait F extends A {
  type AType = Array[Float]
}
```

Workaround: instead of casting directly ".asInstanceOf[T#AType]", cast to AnyRef first: ".asInstanceOf[AnyRef].asInstanceOf[T#AType]".
So how do you submit the bug when the casting itself is broken?
There is no hint on Array[Object] anywhere in the code, not in the bound, and certanly not in the cast. Therefore the casting is broken.

The casting is not broken.  Array[Object] is the erasure of Array[AnyVal], which is the inferred type of the pattern match.  You are letting it be boxed and then trying to cast the boxed array.  Here is a version which works, and it's really not cool to use trac for support.
```scala
  def mkArray[T <: A](atype: Int): T#AType = {
    atype match {
      case 1  => new Array[Int](10).asInstanceOf[T#AType]
      case 2  => new Array[Float](10).asInstanceOf[T#AType]
    }
```
Treating Array[Object] as an erasure of Array[AnyVal] is a bug, because casting primitive arrays to Object[] causes ClassCastException in Java. Also there is no boxing taking place.

I understand that we had our disagreements on the mailing list. If my bug report is too personal for you too handle I suggest you step back and let someone else handle it.
