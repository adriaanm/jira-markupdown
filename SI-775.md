http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/runtime/NonLocalReturnException.scala should be suppressing the stack trace generation for performance reasons. Exception throwing is fast, but stack trace generation is slow. See for example, http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue129.html

The following should do the trick:

```scala
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends RuntimeException{
  override def fillInStackTrace = null;
}
```

Are there any valid used of this exception?  Doesn't the throwing of
of a NonLocalReturnException imply a coding error that should be fixed?  

If so, then I think the stack trace should be filled in.  When I've
recieved these exceptions, getting the stack strace made the fix
very easy.  Now if I get one, figuring out where it was thrown from
is going to be harder.

If these exceptions are thrown only for coding errors, then they
should be never be thrown, so the CPU cost of filling out the stack
trace is not worth optimizing for.
The exception is an implementation detail. You shouldn't ever observe it being thrown within normal coding, but it is thrown and caught when you use the return statement inside an anonymous inner function. For example in the following code:

```scala
   def findMeAKitten(kittens : List[Kitten]) = {
     for(kitten <- kittens){ 
       if (iLike(kitten)) return kitten;
     }
     error("No good kittens. :(");
   }
```

The return statement actually happens inside an anonymous function defined locally, so it can't just use the return instruction. What it actually does is throw a NonLocalReturnException containing the found kitten. 

Consequently this means that if you had written this code previously it would have been much slower than a normal return statement. With the modified code for not filling in stack traces it should be comparably fast.
