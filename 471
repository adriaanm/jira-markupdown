(szeiger in [r26040|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26040]) Always build command lines in partest as Seq[String] instead of space-separated command.

Closes scala/bug#1510 which is actually caused by a bad command line string when the path to Java contains a space, and not by long path names per se. References scala/bug#622 since this commit fixes the specific error described there (not closing because follow-up bugs remain).
