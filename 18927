The [f2de2c4ec43|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/f2de2c4ec43180351ef1f306bcc5f24643ba5477] changed package name in scalap from {{scalap.scala.tools.scalap.scalax.rules}} to {{scalap.scala.tools.scalap.rules}}. Arguably, the old package name was unfortunate but that change breaks both lift-json and json4s. It makes cross-compiling of those libraries against 2.10 and 2.11 close to impossible.

We've got two choices:
1. Revert the change to package names
2. Introduce package objects in the old package with deprecated type aliases and vals for objects.

Given the timing (it's really late) I'll probably go for the first option.
