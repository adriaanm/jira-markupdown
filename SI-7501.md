Just recently, `ExecutionContext` was edited with this:

```scala
  def reportFailure(@deprecatedName('t) cause: Throwable): Unit
```

Since then, it is taken as having a member, `name: String`.

```scala
  /code/scala cat sandbox/name.scala
trait T extends scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext { val name = "" } // false "needs override modifier" error
```

Analysis by Johaness Rudolph (thanks!)
```scala
class strangeTest(x: Symbol) extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

object X {
  val T = 't
}

trait A {
  @strangeTest(X.T) def test(x: String): Unit
}

// compile separately
// trait B extends A { val test = 12 }
```
Yeah, really pretty :)

Here's another minification:

```scala
object Test2 {
 def test(name: String) = 12
}
class strangeTest(x: Int) extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

trait A {
  @strangeTest(Test2.test("test")) def test(x: String): Unit
}

// compile separately
// trait B extends A { val name = 12 }
```

From looking at your graph I'd say the VALsyms in the method type probably introduce the new bindings (although I don't understand why trees in an annotation would ever be  allowed to introduce anything into any context).
I also notice that "currentRun.compiles(<sym>)" is broken for symbols of trees defined in annotations of top-level classes.

```scala
class foo(x: Any) extends annotation.StaticAnnotation

@foo({class C; ()}) trait A
```

You can see the problem by calling `companionSymbolOf` during Namers:

That diff also has an idea for a workaround for that case (which is being explored in macro paradise: https://github.com/scalamacros/paradise/blob/2.10.3/plugin/src/main/scala/org/scalalang/macroparadise/typechecker/Namers.scala#L152)

Jason, thanks for reminding me about this issue.

I have a hard time parsing your comment. What do mean by saying that `currentRun.compiles` is broken? It returns a wrong answer for certain symbols or just blows up?

Also, how `currentRun.compiles` is related to this ticket?
The Run#compiles issue is now tracked: #7758
