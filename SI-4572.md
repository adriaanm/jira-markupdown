=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
scala> (new Array[Unit](5))(0) == ()
<console>:10: warning: comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true
       (new Array[Unit](5))(0) == ()
                               ^
res16: Boolean = false

scala> (new Array[Unit](5))(0) == null
<console>:10: warning: comparing values of types Unit and Null using `==' will always yield false
       (new Array[Unit](5))(0) == null
                               ^
res17: Boolean = true

scala> {val a = Array.fill(5)(()); a(0) == ()}
<console>:11: warning: comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true
       {val a = Array.fill(5)(()); a(0) == ()}
                                        ^
res18: Boolean = true
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
 - There shouldn't be a difference between the first and the third example (assignment prior to comparison).

 - The compiler warning shouldn't contradict the actual result

 - Looking for () in an Array[Unit] should return true, not false

 - Looking for null in an Array[Unit] should return false, not true

=== What do you see instead? ===
Weirdness.

=== Additional information ===
This is probably related #4510.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24908-b20110508020204
