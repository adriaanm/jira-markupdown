```scala
class ImplicitNotFound {

  def main(arguments: Array[String]) {
    {
      implicit def view[A]: A => Array[A] = ???
      val seq: Array[Int] = 1
    }

    {
      implicit def view[A: Manifest]: A => Array[A] = ???
      val seq: Array[Int] = 1 // type mismatch;  found   : Int(1)  required: Array[Int]
    }
  }
}
```
The second version should be 
```scala
 implicit def view[A: Manifest](x: A):  Array[A] = ???
```
In Scala Reference, 7.3 Views:
```
1. If an expression e is of type T , and T does not conform to the expressionâ€™s expected type pt. In this case an implicit v is searched which is applicable to e and whose result type conforms to pt. The search proceeds as in the case of implicit parameters, where the implicit scope is the one of T => pt. If such a view is found, the expression e is converted to v(e).
```

I think `implicit def view[A: Manifest]: A => Array[A]` corresponds `T => pt`. And it even works as implicit parameter:
```scala
implicit def view[A: Manifest]: A => Array[A] = ???
implicitly[Int => Array[Int]] // No compiler error!
```
What you said is different from Scala Reference.
Scala Reference said, the type `T` and the expected type `pt` are determined before the compiler searches for an implicit view.
