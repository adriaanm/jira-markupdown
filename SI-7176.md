"What is the typer contract?"

This patch to return new tree instances from {{Typer#typed}}:

  https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/scala:2.10.x...retronym:topic/tree-clone

Leads to these failing tests:

  https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/scala-checkin-manual/830/console

Use of {{Tree#==}} is the first culprit.
Most calls to == come by way of pattern matching on trees, because patterns like EmptyTree call ==. In my opinion this is a specification bug (see SI-785) and we would be better off in numerous ways if it would call eq.

In fact this is a perfect example of the problem with having different semantics for objects and vals. EmptyTree used to be an object, and in those days it would call eq. At some point during reflection changes it became "val EmptyTree", as did NoSymbol. I'm sure there's zero chance anyone was thinking "and part of this change will be upending the semantics of pattern matching on these things."
Wait, but for Tree that's the same thing, right?

{code}
// Tree 
override def equals(that: Any) = this eq that.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
{code}

It happens to be useful in this case that the calls go through == so we have somewhere to intercept/log/analyse. 
Who would have thought that this could go wrong? https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/86397c9

{code}
// typedCompoundTypeTree
newTyper(context.make(templ, self.typeSymbol, decls)).typedRefinement(templ)
{code}

{code}
    def typedRefinement(templ: Template) {
      val stats = templ.body
      namer.enterSyms(stats)

      // need to delay rest of typedRefinement to avoid cyclic reference errors
      unit.toCheck += { () =>
        val stats1 = typedStats(stats, NoSymbol)
        // this code kicks in only after typer, so `stats` will never be filled in time
        // as a result, most of compound type trees with non-empty stats will fail to reify
        // todo. investigate whether something can be done about this
        val att = templ.attachments.get[CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment].getOrElse(CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment(Nil, Nil))
        templ.removeAttachment[CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment]
        templ updateAttachment att.copy(stats = stats1)
        for (stat <- stats1 if stat.isDef) {
          val member = stat.symbol
          if (!(context.owner.ancestors forall
                (bc => member.matchingSymbol(bc, context.owner.thisType) == NoSymbol))) {
                  member setFlag OVERRIDE
                }
        }
      }
    }
{code}

The lowest friction solution for this would be to make {{CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment}} mutable. We could then attach it to {{templ}} immediately. The deferred code would operate on that attachment, which would have been passed to the copy of tree.

15% less hacky, we could avoid registering this with `unit.toCheck`, and instead have a standard {{ToCheck(() => Unit)}} attachment. At the end of each typing a compilation unit, we would traverse the final tree and execute these blocks of code.

Or find some other way to break the cycles.
Next cab off the rank: when we search for an implicit view that provided some member that matches the arguments, the types of those arguments are looked up in {{context.tree}}.

{code}
    /** Try to apply an implicit conversion to `qual` so that it contains
     *  a method `name`. If that's ambiguous try taking arguments into
     *  account using `adaptToArguments`.
     */
    def adaptToMemberWithArgs(tree: Tree, qual: Tree, name: Name, mode: Int, reportAmbiguous: Boolean, saveErrors: Boolean): Tree = {
      def onError(reportError: => Tree): Tree = {
        context.tree match {
          case Apply(tree1, args) if (tree1 eq tree) && args.nonEmpty =>
            silent(_.typedArgs(args, mode)) match {
              case SilentResultValue(xs) =>
                val args = xs.asInstanceOf[List[Tree]]
                if (args exists (_.isErrorTyped))
                  reportError
                else
                  adaptToArguments(qual, name, args, WildcardType, reportAmbiguous, saveErrors)
              case _            =>
                reportError
            }
          case _ =>
            reportError
        }
      }
      silent(_.adaptToMember(qual, HasMember(name), false)) match {
          case SilentResultValue(res) => res
          case SilentTypeError(err) => onError({if (reportAmbiguous) { context.issue(err) }; setError(tree)})
      }
    }
{code}

But if {{typed}} doesn't operate in-place, that tree contains untyped arguments.
Turns out my canary was placed on the wrong part of the coal mine. By changing it to duplicate the trees *after* type checking, all of the problems with inspecting {{context.tree}} evaporated. Thanks for Lukas and Eugene for helping out with this.

That did leave a few legitimate failures, such as neg/t5696.scala and pos/t5720-ownerous.scala.
