```scala
scala> object X { 0;  (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b))   }
<console>:1: error: ';' expected but '=>' found.
       object X { 0;  (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b))   }
```


Shouldn't this situation be allowed?  A function literal is an expression, and an expression is usable as a statement.  I tried to make Issue 1564, but I ran into this issue.

On a related note, the following output is weird:
```scala
scala> def x() = { 0; (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b)) ; 0  }
x: ()(Int, Int) => Int
```

Shouldn't x be a function from ()=>Int ?
```scala
scala> def x() = { 0; (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b)) ; 0  }
x: ()(Int, Int) => Int
```
*Shouldn't x be a function from ()=>Int ?* 

No, for two reasons.  (1) x is a method.  Method types are printed as `(argtypes)restype`.  (2) Anonymous functions are not restricted to having expressions as their bodies, so the parser is interpreting the body of the anonymous function as extending to the right brace.  Therefore, the method is returning an anonymous function returning 0, not 0.
Uh, in what way is it being treated as a function?  It looks like it is being treated like a method to me.

Yes, arbitrary expressions should ideally be usable as statements.  But as I pointed out in #1564, the problem is not at all related to how the interpreter is implemented.  The problem is entirely within the parser.
You're right, it's treated as a method.  Excellent.  I mis-parsed the type as a function with two parameter lists.

I'll comment on #1654 on #1564.
Fixed in r17144.  I will comment with some detail in #1564.
