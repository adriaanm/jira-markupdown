As reported on SO http://stackoverflow.com/q/28461403/1296806,
```scala
math.BigDecimal("0E+2147483648")
```
throws for reasons of Java backwards compatibility.

The consequence is that ScalaCheck generates BigDecimals that can't be reconstituted.

The Scala factory for BigDecimal could sidestep this problem.
