Yes, I agree. toArray[Any] is clearly the root cause here. As per my other bug about Array[Int] and Array[Any] (SI-1301) the code for handling primitive arrays as Array[Any]s generally appears to flat out not work. 

But I'd expect it to be broken the same way in both compiled and interpreted code if that were the only problem.
