You're right that this should be done (and it's done in r19160) but based on your examples you are laboring under a misapprehension.  Those comparison examples won't change, those are primitive comparisons which don't use an Ordering.  If you use the Ordering now, NaN does the right thing but -0.0 and 0.0 still come out equal because of scala/bug#2378.
