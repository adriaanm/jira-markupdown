Oh, I've just remembered a better sample for the second case. Using DI or AOP its easy to misplace annotation (since you use many of them), say @Inject
```scala
@Inject
class MyComponentImplementation {}
```

Although annotation @Inject have Method|Ctor|Field target, scala compiler will give you nothing on this and you will detect this error only at runtime (upon dependency resolution).
