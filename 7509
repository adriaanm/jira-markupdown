What's the fourth number in the Range {{Int.MaxInt to Int.MaxInt - 10 by -1}}? That's a question you can answer on a {{Seq}}, but not on a {{Set}}. What's the output of {{1 to 10 foreach println}}? Again, a question that can be answers on a {{Seq}}, but not on a {{Set}}. What is the difference between {{1 to 10}} and {{1 to 10 by -1}}? They are different {{Seq}}, but identical {{Set}}.

Scala's {{Range}} fit needs that are not adequately solved by a {{Set}}.

Not that I'd not like a class that implemented mathematical ranges, where the main method was {{contains}}, not {{foreach}}.
