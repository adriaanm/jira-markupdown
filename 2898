I think this worked back when you reported it, but you have to tell partest you're using a different src dir unless you're in files.  It works like this (if not before, then definitely now.)
```scala
test/partest --srcdir pending test/pending/jvm/t2705
```
I could have it infer the srcdir from the test arguments.
