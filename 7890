PR for etapolation at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2793 was closed because of jitters.

The thread suggests more could be done with names in a StringContext, so this is not a duplicate of SI-7715. `cmp"$smaller is smaller than $bigger"(x,y)` where the `cmp` does the obvious computation and makes the args available to the template by name, as it were from the context local to the StringContext.

That "etapolation" coinage might be the best I ever manage; except for the "intersobralator" used by implicitNotFound.
