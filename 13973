I have a large Java/Scala project. Unfortunately, compilation fails because scalac causes a StackOverflowError. 

I have attached the source code of the project. I tried to localize the error but failed. All that I could figure out was that the problem has something to do with file src/scala/javagi/compiler/Translation.scala.

Build instructions (on Unix):

 - Unpack the archive and step into the newly created directory
 - Edit build.sh and adjust the value of scala.home
 - Run build.sh

This should cause output similar to what I have attached to this bug report.
