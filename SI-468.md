Currently, class {{scala.List}} offers a method called {{diff}} to remove the elements of another list from the receiver. It would seem more consistent with the rest of the collection classes to offer a method called {{--}} to perform this task. And this method should then probably accept either an {{Iterable}} or an {{Iterator}}, like the equivalent methods in {{Set}} and {{Map}}.
Probably list should also override +, ++ and other operations from Seq, changing the result to List each time.

fixed in r14110.
