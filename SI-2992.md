I really, really like the new tabcompletion in REPL except from how it works with method arguments. Example:

If I type Math.<tab> I get a wonderful list of all the methods I can call including the "max" method. GREAT!

If I type Math.max(<tab> I would expect a list of all the arguments that can be provided (incl. types since it is a java method) but instead I get this response which is not useful at all : "apple      ch         com        java       javax      jline      org
scala      settings   sun        sunw"

Can this be fixed so tab completion of method arguments are more useful (e.g. work like code completion in the java IDE's ?)

```scala
scala> Math.max

def max(x: Double, y: Double): Double
def max(x: Float, y: Float): Float      def max(x: Int, y: Int): Int
def max(x: Long, y: Long): Long         def max(Double, Double): Double
def max(Float, Float): Float            def max(Int, Int): Int
def max(Long, Long): Long
```
I have tested the new version, and have a few comments;

1) If I just write "M" + <tab>  I get "Menu" and "Music" proposals on my computer which are plain folders under my home dir. I do not think folders should be expanded (unless maybe if they correspond to real packages with class files correctly rooted at the home dir).

2) If I write "Ma" + <tab> I would expect to get "java.lang.Math" as a proposal as Math is in the default lang package (it does work if I write "java.lang.Ma" + <tab>

3) If I write "Math.max" <tab> nothing happens initially but if I press <tab> again I get proposals correctly.

4) If I write "Mat.max(" <tab> I get nothing
