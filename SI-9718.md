```scala
class Foo {
  def foo = ":("
}

trait Bar {
  this: Foo =>

  def bar = ":)"
}

object FooBar {
  def fooBar(bar: Bar) {
    println(bar.foo) // error: value foo is not a member of Bar
    println(bar.bar)
  }
}
```

Since only descendants of `Foo` can have `trait Bar` mixed in I think public `Foo` members should be available through reference of type `Bar`
`val bar = new AnyRef with Bar` doesn't compile. So 'this' boundary tells how trait can be **used** and not how it is **implemented**. And I can't see how it conceptually different from generic parameter boundaries.

Of course I won't insist on language design changes. I just had to note that it **is** visible to clients.
