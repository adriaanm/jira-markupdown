Scala used to issue exhaustiveness warnings in the face of guards. It seems to have disappeared as of 2.10.x: https://gist.github.com/overthink/e56f35159f6bc5751d34  I had stupidly been relying on these warnings... and just got burned.

I would value a compiler flag that will cause a warning when exhaustiveness checks are disabled.
