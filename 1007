It's not, though I've often wished for that capability. What I tend to do in that context is add an additional boolean parameter "thunked" or something like that, with:
```scala
var thunked = false;
lazy val foo = {thunked = true; fooCalc }
```

It would be nice if you could access the functionality to determine if the value had been thunked without needing to recreate it yourself though.
