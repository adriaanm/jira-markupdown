Entering code block in anticipation of my underscores becoming italics...

Would you agree that it's a bug that it fails even if I fully qualify everything with _root_,
e.g. _root_.scala.AnyRef? We have already established in other tickets that _root_ is barely
acknowledged internally; you can define a package named _root_, etc. But if _root_ were
handled like the reserved word that it should be, then a parent _root_.scala.AnyRef should
not require any enhanced interrogation.
