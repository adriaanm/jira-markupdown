Please see SI-1683 for background.  In summary:
{code}
class Outer {
  class Inner { }
  
  def go() = {
    val o1 = new Inner
    val other = new Outer
    val o2 = (new other.Inner).asInstanceOf[Any]  // simulating equals method
    
    println("o2.isInstanceOf[Inner] == " + o2.isInstanceOf[Inner])
    println("o2 match { case _: Inner ... == " + (o2 match { case _: Inner => true ; case _ => false }))

    // at present, for the second line to print true it must be expressed as Outer#Inner
    // println("o2 match { case _: Inner ... == " + (o2 match { case _: Outer#Inner => true ; case _ => false }))
  }
}

object Test 
{
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = new Outer() go
}
{code}
At present this prints true/false.  It needs to print either false/false or true/true.  As indicated in SI-1683 I believe true/true is the better choice.
The change that would be required for the spec is in the section on designators. It currently reads:

Specifically, the unqualified type name $$t$$ where $$t$$ is bound in some class, object, or package $$C$$ is taken as a shorthand for C.this.type # t. 

I propose to change this as follows:

Specifically, the unqualified type name $$t$$ where $$t$$ is bound in some class, object, or package $$C$$ is taken as a shorthand for C.this.type # t, except if the type $$t$$ occurs as a part
of a typed pattern (\sref{sec:typed-patterns}). In the latter case,
$$t$$ is taken as a shorthand for just C # t. 


(In r21255) Closes SI-1698 by reverting to the old spec. Review by extempore.
