Running the following with specs2 will pass on windows but fail on mac.

{noformat}
class MultilineStringTest extends Specification {

  "multi-line string literal should use platform line separator (fails on mac, passes on windows)" >> {
    """
    |""".stripMargin must_== sys.props("line.separator")
  }
}
{noformat}

It seems that new lines within multi-line literals are always \r\n rather than being set to the platform specific. Looks like it only affects IntelliJ IDEA as running the test from SBT doesn't fail on mac. 
It is annoying to work around this in tests as well as in app code, due to separate compilation and cross-compilation.

I think you just get a "\n".  One workaround is:

{code}
import compat.Platform.EOL
s.lines.mkString("", EOL, EOL)
s.lines map (x => f"$x%n") mkString
{code}

Better is a macro to stripMargin and normalize line endings at a go.
A multi-line string literal should return whatever you put between the quotes.  If you get \r\n in there, that's what you should get.  If it's \n, same deal.  The job of multi-line string literals is not to translate what's between the quotes, it's to _be literal_.

And that's exactly what it does.  If you put \r\n in with your editor, you'll get that.  If \n, that.  If you want to write on a platform that does one and parse lines on something that does the other, parse the lines using something that knows how to parse lines (e.g. call `lines` on the margin-stripped string).  It's a bit annoying, but pretty much _everything_ works that way in Java (and Scala's IO basically comes from Java).
