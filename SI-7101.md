```scala
scala> class C(x: Int = 1)(y: Int)

scala> new C()
<console>:9: error: missing arguments for constructor C in class C
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
```

This does not tell you that an entire parameter list is missing. You might be tempted to think that there's a problem with the default.

For methods we're good:
```scala
scala> def foo(x: Int = 1)(y: Int) = 1

scala> foo()
<console>:9: error: missing arguments for method foo;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
```
Full disclosure:
```scala
cala> class C(x: Int = 1)(y: Int)
defined class C

scala> new C
<console>:14: error: missing argument list for constructor C in class C
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
       new C
       ^

scala> new C()
<console>:14: error: missing argument list for constructor C in class C
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
       new C()
       ^

scala> new C()()
<console>:14: error: not enough arguments for constructor C: (y: Int)C.
Unspecified value parameter y.
       new C()()
       ^
```
These error messages are especially problematic because repl doesn't offer completion for constructors, so you really don't know what you're looking at.
