The following case, and variations of it, do not work currently:
{code}
val
x
=
3
{code}
This worked in 2.6.0-final.

Sean, you have looked at parsing recently, so if you can figure it out that would be great.  Otherwise I guess it has to go back to the pool; I will look at it as time permits but the fix is not obvious to me.

One oddity I have noticed is that if you type "def" by itself, the error message is that an identifier was expected but a ';' was found.  I do not know why a ';' would be seen by the parser.
Here is another example that worked in 2.6.0-final but no longer:
{code}
def m = {
if (2>1)
3
else
4
}
{code}

The shell complains at the "else" line.  If I put the "4" on the same line as the "else", then the shell accepts it.

Here is another example, originally in bug SI-242.
{code}
   def f = 
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple expression
       def f = 
               ^
{code}

In general, the issue is that sometimes syntaxError is being called instead of incompleteInputError.  The "semicolon seen" business is the best clue that has surfaced so far about why that might be happening.
Fixed in r13323. It needed a change in NewScanners (line 183, for Sean to review).
