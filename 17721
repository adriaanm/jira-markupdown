I tried hard to find a ticket for this, as I'd be surprised not to have one already. I found related tickets scala/bug#1352 and scala/bug#1994, but not exactly this one.

See related [IDE ticket #1000758](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000758#/activity/ticket:)
```scala
// WithClone.java
package test;

public abstract class WithClone {
  public abstract Object clone();
}
```
```scala
// Use.scala
import test.WithClone

class Foo {
 def test(x: WithClone) {
   x.clone() 
 }
}
```
results in
```scala
se.scala:5: error: method clone in class Object cannot be accessed in test.WithClone
 Access to protected method clone not permitted because
 prefix type test.WithClone does not conform to
 class Foo where the access take place
   x.clone() 
     ^
one error found
```
