I tried hard to find a ticket for this, as I'd be surprised not to have one already. I found related tickets SI-1352 and SI-1994, but not exactly this one.

See related [IDE ticket #1000758|https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000758#/activity/ticket:]

{code}
// WithClone.java
package test;

public abstract class WithClone {
  public abstract Object clone();
}
{code}

{code}
// Use.scala
import test.WithClone

class Foo {
 def test(x: WithClone) {
   x.clone() 
 }
}
{code}
results in

{code}
