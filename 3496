As illustration, I just implemented -Xmigration and attached warnings to the bits of Stack which changed from 2.7 to 2.8.  Now compiling with that option one would see things like:
{code}
[scalacfork] Compiling 542 files to /scratch/trunk1/build/quick/classes/library
[scalacfork] /scratch/trunk1/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashSet.scala:131: warning: method foreach in class Stack has changed semantics:
[scalacfork]  Stack iterator and foreach now traverse in FIFO order.
[scalacfork]     toUndo foreach undo
[scalacfork]     ^
[scalacfork] /scratch/trunk1/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/StackProxy.scala:68: warning: method ++= in class Stack has changed semantics:
[scalacfork]  Stack ++= now pushes arguments on the stack from left to right.
[scalacfork]     self ++= iter
[scalacfork]     ^
{code}
Etc.
