```scala
object Test extends App {
  {
    @deprecated("foo", "")
    def foo {}

    foo
  }
}
```

Outcome: app compiles without any warnings.
It turns out not to be ignored, but useful.  Without the annotation on old, I see warnings on my gazillion calls to Y2K_workaround.

On visibility,  I think the helpful warning on Fooer.foo (because someone added an impl in Foo) is not different from a helpful warning on fun (because someone, maybe me, moved it from Fooer into usage, not noticing the invocation further down; or maybe I lost track of indentation and I pasted it in the wrong place when I was converting tabs to spaces and adding scaladoc).

It's useful to see either a warning that the local @deprecation won't generate warnings, or a warning on each invocation (such as old, which really does invoke deprecated public API).

Full disclosure: I actually have no reason to care about this. The use case was inspired by #5715.

```scala
package object deprlocal {
  def ??! = throw new NoLongerImplementedError
}

package deprlocal {

final class NoLongerImplementedError(msg: String = "Deprecation cycle complete") extends Error(msg)

class Foo {
  def foo: Unit = ???
}

class Fooer extends Foo {
  // warn about broken usage
  @deprecated("foo", "") override def foo = useCase()

  def usage() {
    // refactored from class, no warning
    @deprecated("the fun is gone","") def fun = ??!
    // 1000 LOC
    fun
  }

  def useCase() {
    val f = new Features
    @deprecated("I call deprecated features!","") def old() {
      val old_data = f.Y2K_workaround()
      val older_data = f.Y2K_workaround()
      // other deprecated calls
    }
    old() // TODO: use the new stuff
  }
}
class Features {
  @deprecated("Welcome to the 20th C","") def Y2K_workaround() = ??!
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val f: Foo = new Fooer
    f.foo
  }
}
}
```
