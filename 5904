The error message is fine. 

It all starts with 
```scala
val handlers = new HashMap[DerivedPushNode[_], HandlerBase[_]]
```

Quoting from Sec. 3.2 of the Scala Language Spec, Placeholder Syntax for Existential Types

"wildcard type is a shorthand for an existentially quantified type variable"


And now from 3.2.10:

"The set of values denoted by the existential type T forSome {Q} is the union of the set of values of all its type instances."

Saying 
```scala
val handlers = new HashMap[DerivedPushNode[_], HandlerBase[_]]
```

casts a wider net than just what (apparently) is intended: a map from `DerivedPushNode[EventType]`  to `HandlerBase[EventType]`
