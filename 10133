I added a better diagnostic for this issue in Scala 2.11.0-M5. See: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5e8bc196cebcbaf86a63330cf0474909f72a6fe0

In the meantime, with 2.10.2, you could find out the last JAR opened by the process by tracing system calls with `fs_usage`.
```
% sudo fs_usage | grep jar

# in another terminal
% scala
```
