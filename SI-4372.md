This is an enhancement request for Scaladoc.

In the signatures for methods and types in Scaladoc colons are always preceded by white space.

I suggest that colons should not be preceded by white space as this seems to be the most common style used for Scala code and is also used in the Scala standard library.

So instead of this:
```scala
  def addString ( b : StringBuilder ) : StringBuilder 
```

I suggest the following:
```scala
  def addString ( b: StringBuilder ): StringBuilder 
```

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 and 2.9 trunk
(In r24617) [scaladoc] Remove whitespace around colon and parentheses. Closes #4372. Review by pedrofurla.
