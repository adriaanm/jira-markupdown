The cause of the problem is a missing JAR on the classpath.

If you move the `mock` call to the top level, you get a more accurate error message.
```
info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /Users/jason/code/scratch1/target/scala-2.10/classes...
[error] bad symbolic reference to class MockSettings in package mockito (a classfile may be missing)
[error] one error found
```

After adding the following:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.mockito" % "mockito-all" % "1.9.0"
```

Both the reduced and originally reported files compile successfully.

But no doubt we should issue this error in both cases. It will be interesting to piece together the circumstances that lead do that assertion error during unpickling.
