The attached file contains a small sbt project that compiles fine, but if I edit the source with ensime activated in emacs, the annotation argument is highlighted as "`annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: AnEnum.BAR`" The source for the two class files in lib/annot.jar is in the archive, too, but outside of the project so as not to trigger #2764. This is probably the problem discussed in comments [http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/2764#comment:28 28] to [http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/2764#comment:31 31] there.

Florian, Igor, could you check if this issue is solved in latest Scala trunk, since #2764 is fixed?
