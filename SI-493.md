Probably related to SI-160 "Sean broke arrays". I would expect the array to be the same in both contexts, y and z. Is this fixable soon, should we have an isArray function in the meantime?
{code}
object BoxedArrayTest {

 val y = new collection.mutable.HashMap[String,Any]
 val z = new collection.mutable.HashMap[String,Any]

 y("msg") = Array[String]("1","2")

 val array: Array[String] = Array[String]("1","2")
 z("msg") = array

 def main(args:Array[String]) = {

   println(y("msg").isInstanceOf[Array[_]])  // prints true

   println(z("msg").isInstanceOf[Array[_]])  // prints false

   // these work, without producing a match error

   y.get("msg") match {
     case Some(ys:runtime.BoxedAnyArray) =>
   }

   z.get("msg") match {
     case Some(_:Array[String]) =>
   }
  }
}
{code}
I understand why this is happening and that it's probably not fixable, but I'd like to quickly point out that this is inconsistent with the Scala spec. From section 12.3.4: 

{code}
Second, for polymorphic arrays, that have a type parameter or abstract type T as
their element type, a representation different from []T might be used. However, it is
guaranteed that isInstanceOf and asInstanceOf still work as if the array used the
standard representation of monomorphic arrays:
{code}

And this is an instance of isInstanceOf not working as if the array used the standard representation of monomorphic arrays.

This is probably an issue with the spec rather than the implementation.
