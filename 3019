Hi Miles,

the below code gives a bogus error message in the Scala editor: 
```scala
package test

import javax.persistence._

class User {

  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  var lastLogin: java.util.Date = _

}
```

The message is: "annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: TemporalType{<null>}.TIMESTAMP{<null>}" and I believe that it happens because the Scala compiler believes that Java Enums are not valid values for annotation arguments (TemportalType is a Java Enum).

Sorry for the external dependency to JPA but this does not work if the annotation and the enum are defined in the same project as the User class (maybe due to a compiler bug, I'll file another bug report).
