This program should not warn about the abstract type being eliminated by erasure because we are testing for a more specific type than the one which is eliminated by erasure - it is a test which we can perform.
```scala
object Foo {
  def f[T <: AnyRef](x: Any, y: T) = x match {
    case _: y.type => true
  }
}
```
