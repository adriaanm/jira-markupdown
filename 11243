None of the workarounds I found here or elsewhere was preventing build failures for me, which motivated me to figure out how to suppress the transitive dependency which led to the downloading of redundant 2.10.2 (not to mention 2.10.0 and probably others depending on the plugin selection) artifacts. In project/plugins.sbt:
```scala
 def plugin(m: ModuleID) = Defaults.sbtPluginExtra(m, "0.13", "2.10") excludeAll ExclusionRule("org.scala-lang")

 libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   plugin("me.lessis"    % "bintray-sbt"     % "0.1.2"),
   plugin("com.typesafe" % "sbt-mima-plugin" % "0.1.6")
 )
```
