val s = Stream.from(0)
s.equals(s) // does not terminate

But the contract states: "It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x) should return true."

See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29
I believe that's still reflexive -- if it hasn't yet returned false or thrown an exception, then you can't yet say it didn't return true. But, I think it should be fixed anyway.
