The concrete [problem|https://github.com/nparry/orderly4jvm/pull/3] is that {{CharArrayReader}}'s constructor implicitly uses {{Predef.arrayToCharSequence}} which implements {{CharSequence.subSequence}} by calling {{Array.slice}} on the underlying array which creates a new copy of the array containing the subsequence. Contrast this with {{String.subSequence}} which creates a shallow copy with only updated indices.

Using a `CharArrayReader` in parser combinators can therefore lead to really bad performance issues which can't be figured out easily.

The next question is if `Predef.arrayToCharSequence` really should implement `subsequence` by making a copy. The problem is that `java.lang.CharSequence` isn't explicit in what to expect from ``subSequence`` if the underlying data structure is mutable.
