Consider the following code:
```scala
def iterate(n: Int): Iterator[Int] = Iterator.single(n) ++ (if (n == 0) Iterator.empty else iterate(n-1))

def time[T](label: String)(thunk: => T): T = {
	val start = System.currentTimeMillis
	val result = thunk
	val end = System.currentTimeMillis
	println(s"$label took ${end-start} ms")
	result
}

for (n <- 0 to 2000 by 200) {
	time(s"iterate($n)") {
		iterate(n).foreach(_ => ())
	}
}
```

when run I get:
```scala
$ scala iterate.scala 
iterate(0) took 1 ms
iterate(200) took 9 ms
iterate(400) took 27 ms
iterate(600) took 96 ms
iterate(800) took 237 ms
iterate(1000) took 475 ms
iterate(1200) took 834 ms
iterate(1400) took 1360 ms
iterate(1600) took 2123 ms
iterate(1800) took 3091 ms
iterate(2000) took 4078 ms
```

One would expect linear increase of the time we need to iterate all elements returned by iterate method. I didn't dig deeper to understand why this code is so slow but I decided to log a ticket instead. Original inspiration for this code comes from https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2331
Seems like Paul got this one at the second swing, in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/e3ddb2d.

I don't want to add an ad-hoc and potentially brittle performance test for this. I do lament the lack of a place to write and run a real test. What became of scala-meter?
