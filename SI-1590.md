I have a simple Scala project (no external dependencies except for Scala 2.7.2.final JUnit 4.4) 

source folders:
{code}
  Source/Scala           output to target/classes
  UnitTest/Source/Scala  output to target/test-classes
{code}

After creating a new test class named com/mypackage/TestMain
with JUnit 4 annotations

{code}
import org.junit.Test
import org.junit.Assert.assertTrue
@Test
class TestMain {
  @Test
  def runSamples : Unit = {
     assertTrue(true)
  }
}
{code}

the plugin compiles this file correctly 
(I can see the .class file in the Navigator view of my target/test-classes folder) but I cannot run it as a JUnit test.

Eclipse shows a dialog:

No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 4'

Some discussion of this problem appeared on the mailing list;
see http://www.nabble.com/How-to-use-junit-4-with-scala-under-eclipse-3.3--td18434072.html

One workaround is to add the bin directory as a source folder.
Eclipse does not let me do this via the UI; I get an error such as 

  Source folder '!UnitTest/Source/Scala' in project 'sas.acl.al.scala' cannot output to distinct source folder 'target/test-classes'

I can close the project and add the directory by editing the .classpath file outside of Eclipse, and sometimes this problem goes away, but each time I add a new unit test, I have to close the project (which closes my open files) and reopen it. Even then, sometimes Eclipse loses track of the unit tests and won't run them.

I use JUnit instead of !ScalaTest, Specs etc. because our larger development process uses JUnit and Maven to build projects and run unit tests and generate reports, and also I prefer the ability to run unit tests from Eclipse and use the JUnit view.

I also get a JUnit Launch dialog "No JUnit tests found".
When I build with maven, it runs the JUnit 4 tests as expected (i.e.
via the annotations). See attached image.

I have the same problem with Eclipse 3.4.1 and Scala plugin 2.7.3 RC1. I have added @Test to class and method. Class file exists, is in classpath and has annotations (checked with jclasslib byte code viewer). No luck with JUnit3 and JUnit4 runner. 

This might be related: 

Executing a JUnit 3 style test case (i.e. extending from class TestCase) results in "No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 3'" depending on how TestCase is imported:

{code}
//import junit.framework.TestCase  // This works
import junit.framework.{TestCase}  // this doesn't: No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 3'
{code}

I see green :-) That is, I am now able to launch JUnit 4 tests from my Scala perspective. I've not verified this for all my Scala projects, but initial
indications are good.

Fixed, probably at the same time as SI-1349.
I'm now using 2.7.6.final and this problem is occurring again. May be due to SI-1349, which I'm also seeing (I have JUnit 4.5 in my Build Path and am using the JUnit 4 test runner.) 

This was from an old project that had JUnit 3 based tests that
I was able to run. Then today I converted to JUnit 4 using @Test instead
of extends TestCase and the tests worked with annotations... for a while.
After a few edit/save/test cycles, however, the tests stopped running
and Eclipse reported the same error dialog from the JUnit view
when I clicked on the JUnit run button

   No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 4'

As with SI-1349, I cannot invoke Run as... JUnit test from the Package Explorer view.

I did a Project -> clean and the problem persists. The tests compile
file, I just cannot run them using only the annotations.
When I switch back to extends TestCase the runner can find/execute them
without fail.
