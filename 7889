Not to be too picky, but I'd imagine the syntax would be this:

{code}
val template = s"""This is string ${_:Int}."""
{code}

In don't understand why it doesn't work, actually. It should expand to:

{code}
val template = new StringContext("""This is string""").s(_: Int)
{code}

Which is valid code.
