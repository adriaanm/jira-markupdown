=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
ashee:~ amitava$$ scala 
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.RC4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_24).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :t (List[1,2,3])
Failed to determine type.

```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

=== What do you see instead? ===

=== Additional information ===
This was discussed in the mailing list and fixed by extempore in RC3 - see changeset https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/changeset/24867

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC4
  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Darwin Kernel Version 10.7.0
This is not a regression, just that you used '[]' instead of '()', so the expression isn't valid.

```scala
scala> :t (List(1,2,3))
List[Int]
```

This might instead be reclassified as a request to show compiler error messages for :t.  It is possible Paul intentionally suppressed error detail, so he can comment on that.
(extempore in [r25040](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25040)) Give some feedback on invalid :type expressions.  Closes #4556, no review.
