noticed that the tabPlacement_= method wasn't implemented in the TabbedPane class definition so that in my subclass, I have this code: 

tabPlacement(Alignment.Bottom) 
tabLayoutPolicy = Layout.Wrap 

if I switch to standard field setting syntax with an = for the tabPlacement field, the compiler produces a missing method error, although the tabLayoutPolicy field appears to have that method implemented. 
(imaier in [r25492](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25492)) Fixes typo in setter method. Closes #4811.
