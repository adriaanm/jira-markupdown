Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19673-b20091116132603 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

Given A.scala, C.scala:
{code}
class A[+T]
object C {
	val a: A[Any] = new A[Int]
}
{code}

 1. Compile
 1. change A.scala to
{code}
class A[T]
{code}
 1. Mark A.scala modified.  Only A.scala is recompiled, missing the compile error that would result if C.scala were recompiled.
 
(In r20376) Closes SI-2793, SI-2651, SI-2650, SI-2653. Review by dragos.
(In r20624) Closes SI-2653, SI-2652, SI-2556. The last one required more sophisticated mechanism for detecting invalid references to inherited members, but at least it doesn't seem to cause unnecessary recompilations.
