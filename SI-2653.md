Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19673-b20091116132603 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

Given A.scala, C.scala:
```scala
class A[+T]
object C {
	val a: A[Any] = new A[Int]
}
```

 1. Compile
 1. change A.scala to
```scala
class A[T]
```
 1. Mark A.scala modified.  Only A.scala is recompiled, missing the compile error that would result if C.scala were recompiled.
 
(In r20376) Closes #2793, #2651, #2650, #2653. Review by dragos.
(In r20624) Closes #2653, #2652, #2556. The last one required more sophisticated mechanism for detecting invalid references to inherited members, but at least it doesn't seem to cause unnecessary recompilations.
