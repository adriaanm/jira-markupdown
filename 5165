(In r24063) Taking a ride from 106 invalid generic signatures to zero.
Closes SI-4067.

Numbers 1-72:
Problem: Primitive types appearing in generic bounds.
Response: Use the boxed types.

Numbers 73-105:
Problem: Doubly nested classes can become Outer<T>.Inner.Inner2
Response: Don't allow dots except immediately following angle brackets.

Number 106:
Problem: Array may be being used as a higher kinded type,
and in such cases should not receive the special Array treatment.
Solution: args.nonEmpty

Observe my claim is that 106/106 signatures have been made
"valid", not "correct" or even "more nearly correct." As to that
I would like a second opinion.  And.... review by moors!
