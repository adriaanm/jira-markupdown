Hi Guys. 
 
The update from Beta1 to RC1 or RC2 seems to have changed behaviour when integrating with Spring: 
 

{code}
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: 
Unexpected exception parsing XML document from class path resource 
[mypackage/application-dao.xml]; nested exception is 
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Annotation-specified bean name 
'myBeanInterface' for bean class [mypackage.MyBeanImpl] conflicts with 
existing, non-compatible bean definition of same name and class 
[mypackage.MyBeanImpl$$]
{code}

We are using Spring 3.0.2.RELEASE.
 
 
Thanks for your help,

Hi.

Apologies, here is a sample:

{code}
trait MyBeanInterface {
  def doSomething....
}

....

import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository

@Repository("myBean")
object MyBeanImpl extends MyBeanInterface {
  def doSomething....
}
{code}

cheers,

Ross

If I change 

{code}
object MyBeanImpl...
{code}

to 
{code}
class MyBeanImpl...
{code}

I progress to a new error:

{code}
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'sessionFactory' 
defined in class path resource [application-hibernate.xml]: Invocation of init method failed; 
nested exception is org.hibernate.AnnotationException: No identifier specified for entity: com.mypackage.TestEntity
{code}

where TestEntity is something like:

{code}
....
trait ParentEntity extends Serializable {
  
  
  def getId: Long
...


....
import javax.persistence.{Column, Entity, GeneratedValue, GenerationType, Id, Table}
...
@Entity
@Table(name = "TEST_ENTITY_TABLE")
case class TestEntity(
        @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
        @Column(name = "TEST_ENTITY_ID", nullable = false)
        @BeanProperty var id: Long) extends ParentEntity
{code}




Hi Ross,

the first problem you see is the following: for top-level object definitions the scala compiler generates two classes (two classfiles), on named "!ObjectName$$" (containing the actual implementation) and a "mirror class" named "!ObjectName" wich contains static methods that forward to the actual implementations. The second one is generated for Java compatibility only, to ease accessing object members from java.

The scala compiler copies all annotations from the object to the mirror class, that's why Spring sees two classfiles with a {{@Repository("myBean")}} annotation. 

Do you think this is plausible?

Maybe we should just not add the annotations to the mirror classes, or make this configurable using the target-meta-annotations (see below).

The second (after changing it to be a class) is different issue. It looks like you're trying to annotate the field "id" with "@Id", but you're actually annotating the constructor parameter. In order to hit the field, you need to use the {{target.field}} meta-annotation, see https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/browse/scala-svn/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/annotation/target/field.scala?r=HEAD
Hi Lukas.

Looking at other javax.persistence annotations like @Column or @OneToMany, how do you recommend dealing with them ? 

Some examples:

{code}
@Column(name = "TEST_ENTITY_ID", nullable = false)
....
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "testEntity")
{code}

There is bespoke attribute information required, so this would not seem to fit the type alias strategy.

The Id annotation mod worked, but now I have failing OneToMany's etc.

Thanks for your help,

Yes, using a type alias should still work.

{code}
type MyColumn = javax.persistence.Column @field
@MyColumn(name = "TEST_ENTITY_ID", nullable = false)
{code}

Hi Lukas.  I suppose I meant there is no one size to fit all approach with this example like there is with Id, because of the bespoke attribute information required.  We need to either make do with messier code, or write a type alias for every column.  While not the end of the world, this loses some of the gain we made when switching from Java to Scala to benefit from the concise syntax.

Cheers,

Perhaps I misunderstood your sample.  If this is simply a case of replacing all javax.persistence annotations with our own type alias's, then all is well.  Thanks for your help.

Hi Lukas.

I have finished upgrading our annotations and all is working.  Unfortunately an old ticket has re-surfaced and is causing us problems: SI-2357.

We have a variable as per:

{code}
@Column(name="ISO_CODE", nullable=false, length=4)
@BeanProperty var isoCode: String = _
{code}

We get an error complaining about 'oCode', looks like the same problem as before.

Cheers,

Ross

Good to hear!

Where are you putting the "@Column" annotation (how is the type alias defined)?

Our type alias is :

{code}
type Column = javax.persistence.Column @beanGetter
{code}

The @Column annotation is setup as referenced above.

i don't see what could be the error.. 
it looks like you end up with a method named `isoCode` which has the Column annotation.

if you can get me a small example to reproduce it please open another ticket.

for the target meta-annotation for objects i opened another ticket (SI-3599)

thanks: lukas
