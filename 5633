I've hit the problem with the SeqViewLike. all the methods of SeqLike not overriden in the trait are forwarded back to the SeqLike trait, and try to use the standard builder. From what I could see in the code I think this could be case for other collection as well.

I wonder if it would not be safer for the community to deprecate or remove views and favour iterator style in one of the next releases. This is a small non breaking change that will immediately force user to run away from views.
