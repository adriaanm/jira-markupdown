Only Java Working Set is available to be created if you make yourself the effort to go out of your way and configure the working sets.
Scala projects can be added to Java working sets just fine.

I don't see any particular gain to be hand from creating a new kind of working set which only Scala (rather than Scala and Java) projects can be added to.
