Recently the definition of Iterator.takeWhile was changed from 

{code}
 def takeWhile(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = {
    val self = buffered
    new Iterator[A] {
      def hasNext = { self.hasNext && p(self.head) }
      def next() = (if (hasNext) self else empty).next()
    }
  }
{code}

to

{code}
 def takeWhile(p: A => Boolean): Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
    private var hd: A = _
    private var hdDefined: Boolean = false
    private var tail: Iterator[A] = self
 
    def hasNext = hdDefined || tail.hasNext && {
      hd = tail.next()
      if (p(hd)) hdDefined = true 
      else tail = Iterator.empty
      hdDefined
    }
    def next() = if (hasNext) { hdDefined = false; hd } else empty.next()
  }
{code}

The problem is that by not using the function buffered, odd things happen when you use takeWhile in a BufferedIterator:

{code}
scala> val x = List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7).iterator.buffered
scala> x.takeWhile(_ < 5).toList                    
res7: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
scala> x.toList                                     
res8: List[Int] = List(6, 7)
{code}
see also SI-3581
If you want something you can call takeWhile on, and also continue to use the original as if nothing had happened, then I would suggest you use Stream, not Iterator.

Iterator has internal mutable state. This issue is a good example of the kinds of problems mutable state causes.

I'd suggest using Iterator.span for that.

Many months later, I still think this should be changed.  In response to the first comment from Donna, this behavior has EVERYTHING to do with the change to takeWhile.  While I'm sure the change was intended to tackle performance issues, it clearly changed behavior of takeWhile on BufferedIterator.

{code:java}

// enrich wrapper to give original functionality
class EnrichedIterator[T](it: Iterator[T]) {
  def takeWhileOriginal(p: T=>Boolean) = {
    val self = it.buffered
    new Iterator[T] {
      def hasNext = { self.hasNext && p(self.head) }
      def next() = (if (hasNext) self else Iterator.empty).next()
    }
  }
}
implicit def enrichIterator[T](it: Iterator[T]) = new EnrichedIterator(it)
{code}

With the original takeWhile.

{code:java}
scala> val x = List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7).iterator.buffered
x: java.lang.Object with scala.collection.BufferedIterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> x.takeWhileOriginal(_<5).toList
res2: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> x.next
res3: Int = 5
{code}

With the new takeWhile.

{code:java}
scala> val x = List(1,2,3,4,5,6,7).iterator.buffered
x: java.lang.Object with scala.collection.BufferedIterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> x.takeWhile(_<5).toList
res6: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> x.next
res7: Int = 6
{code}
From the Iterator docs:

{code}
 *  It is of particular importance to note that, unless stated otherwise, ''one should never
 *  use an iterator after calling a method on it''. The two most important exceptions
 *  are also the sole abstract methods: `next` and `hasNext`.
{code}

So, after you call `takeWhile`, all bets are off.
