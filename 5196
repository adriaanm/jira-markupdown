(In r24091) closes scala/bug#2741, scala/bug#4079: pickling now ensures that a local type param with a non-local owner, which will thus get a localized owner, will only get a class as its localized owner if its old owner was a class (otherwise, NoSymbol)
this ensures that asSeenFrom does not treat typerefs to this symbol differently after pickling.

todo: should we pro-actively set the owner of these type params to something else than the type alias that they originate from? see notes in typeFunAnon
