When I log onto this site and try to enter a Trac, 
I often get logged out (session terminated?) between
when I click 'New Ticket' and enter a bug description
and the time that I preview or submit the ticket.
When I click submit, I get an error 
{code}
Forbidden

TICKET_CREATE privileges are required to perform this operation
{code}
and I am no longer logged in; I have to click the login button.

I do have cookies enabled; I use Firefox 2.1 or 3.0Beta
but it also occurs with Internet Explorer.
I have similar problems using Trac for Project Fortress.

This is particularly frustrating because Trac clears
the form; if I try to use the browser to go back,
the description is blank and I have to type it all in again.
