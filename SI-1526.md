In sufficiently large source files, it is not uncommon to have a missing close } on a def. However, the compiler diagnostics for this situation are not helpful... you get two warnings, at the end of the source:
{code}
'}' expected but eof found.
block must end in result expression, not in definition	
{code}
Neither tells you where the block begins, which is the
crucial bit of information needed to quickly fix this.
(This problem occurs frequently because the Scala plugin
for Eclipse adds a closing } after you type "{" and " "
and sometimes you don't notice it until it is much too late.)

To fix such errors, I'm forced into trial and error 
of adding } until I can find the offending def.

Please list the line number location of the beginning
of the block.
