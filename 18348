A FileChooser can't be opened over a Frame or a Dialog, because show*Dialog needs a Component, and neither Frame nor Dialog are one. I would expect this to work, because you can do it in Java, and I'd even say that Frame and Dialog are the only sensible things to open a chooser over (well, and Applet, I guess).
