Source.getLines appears to be... entirely broken. I have a very simple test case: a plain-jain text file of three lines save in normal utf-8. Calling .getLines on the Source from this File does nothing: an empty iterator, no lines at all. However, it has no problem iterating over the chars. 

This is a regression, it worked without a problem in 2.8. This paste shows exactly the problem and compares with 2.8:

I suspect I know what is happening. Take a look at this code inside {{BufferedSource}}:

{code:scala}
  def reader() = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, codec.decoder)
  def bufferedReader() = new BufferedReader(reader(), bufferSize)
  
  override val iter = {
    val reader = bufferedReader()    
    Iterator continually (codec wrap reader.read()) takeWhile (_ != -1) map (_.toChar)
  }

  class BufferedLineIterator extends Iterator[String] {
    val bufReader = BufferedSource.this.bufferedReader()
{code}

The definition {{reader}} creates a new {{InputStreamReader}} out of {{inputStream}}, which is then used to create a {{BufferedReader}} by {{bufferedReader}}. The latter method is called inside {{iter}} to create an iterator, and it is also called by {{BufferedLineIterator}}. However, I'm guessing {{inputStream}} has already been consumed by either {{InputStreamReader}} or {{BufferedReader}} constructor.

Nope, I'm wrong. It is {{Iterator continually (codec wrap reader.read()) takeWhile (_ != -1) map (_.toChar)}} which consumes the input stream.

The problem happens at {{takeWhile}}. It's {{hasNext}} calls {{next}} on the iterator it is based on, therefore changing it (ie, calling {{reader.read}}). Perhaps it would be best for {{takeWhile}} not to do so, but the main problem here is that calling {{getLines}} will only work if the previous iterator had not been used at all.

I think the proper solution would be for {{val reader}}/{{val bufReader}} to be moved up one level in scope and _shared_ between {{iter}} and {{BufferedLineIterator}}.

On the other hand, it turns out this bug isn't all that bad. It only happens if you do something to the iterator before using it -- such as REPL showing whether the iterator is empty or not.

Moving {{reader}}/{{bufReader}} won't work. A {{hasNext}} will still call {{next}} on it, making the first character, if nothing else, unavailable to {{getLines}}. So maybe a {{reset}} is needed, or fixing {{takeWhile}} not to be destructive on {{hasNext}} after all, even though it has worked that way all the way since r19900.
BTW try
{code}
io.Source.stdin.getLines.foreach(println)
{code}
It shows first line only after we entered second line.

AFAIK it happens 'cause {{BufferedSource.BufferedLineIterator}} has
{code}
var nextLine = bufReader.readLine
{code}
So when we create {{BufferedLineIterator}} by calling {{getLines}} we also wait for a user input.

I guess the correct code is something like this:
{code}
class BufferedLineIterator extends Iterator[String] {
  val bufReader = BufferedSource.this.bufferedReader()
  var nextLine = null
  var unread = true

  override def hasNext() = {
    if (unread) {
      nextLine = bufReader.readLine
      unread = false
    }
    nextLine != null
  }

  override def next(): String = {
    val result = nextLine
    if (unread) {
      nextLine = bufReader.readLine
    } else {
      unread = true
    }
    result
  }
}
{code}

Should I create a new bug for this or these bugs are same?
That's a different bug, really, but I'm not in any position to tell you whether to open a new bug or not.

The solution you provided is still suboptimal, however, because whenever you call "next", it will only return after the the _following_ line has read. In other words, you fixed it for first/second line, but it will still happen with second/third, third/fourth, etc. For an example of the sort of problem this can give, see SI-4599.

I think the following would fix it for {{next}}:

{code:scala}
  override def next(): String = {
    if (unread) {
      nextLine = bufReader.readLine
    }
    unread = true
    nextLine
  }
{code}

(extempore in [r25212|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25212]) Keep BufferedSource from losing buffered data when a derivative iterator
is created via getLines.  Closes #4671, #4662, no review.
I'm still having problems with this on 2.9.2r25743-b20110928032420 from within the scala-ide:

{code}
@RunWith(classOf[JUnitRunner])
class SourceTest extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers with Logger {
  import scala.io.Source._
  it should "not frikkin eat it up" in {
    val source = fromInputStream(this.getClass.getResourceAsStream("fileWithTwoLines"))(Codec.UTF8)
    debug("source: " + source)
    val lines = source.getLines()
    debug("lines.hasNext: " + lines.hasNext)
    debug("lines size: " + lines.size)
    debug("lines: " + lines)
    debug("lines.hasNext: " + lines.hasNext)
    for(line <- lines) yield (debug("line: " + line))
  }
}
{code}

yields the following log:

{code}

16:40:54.576 [main] DEBUG test.SourceTest - source: non-empty iterator
16:40:54.583 [main] DEBUG test.SourceTest - lines.hasNext: true
