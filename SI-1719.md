ScalaUIPlugin has the following code:

{code}
    override def initialize(doc : IDocument) : Unit = {
      if (doc == null || source == null) {
        assert(true)
        assert(true)
        assert(true)
      }
      doc.set(new String(source.toCharArray))
    }
{code}

That looks a bit weird.
Some nonesense that Sean put in. There's kind of a justification for just one ... it creates a place where a breakpoint can be set reliably, but I've no idea why he felt the need for three in a row or thought it would be appropriate to commit the addition.

Patches to remove these would be very welcome.

Two weird cases not handled by the patch:

Plugin.scala
{code}
  def abort : Nothing = {
    assert(false);
    throw new Error;
  }
{code}

The assert method in the same class (shown below) throws error anyway, so not sure what the aim is there.

{code}
  def assert(b : Boolean) : Unit = {
    if (!b)
       throw new Error();
  }
{code}

Another case is Nodes.scala.

{code}
  def assert(b : Boolean) : Unit = {
    if (!b) {
      if (this == null) assert(false)
      throw new Error
    }
  }
{code}

Infinite recursion in case this == null (which should not happen under normal circumstances). I assume that line can be removed, but the patch doesn't include it.
