The following appeared in 2.10.0-RC1 in the Akka build (was not present in 2.10.0-M7):

```scala
[warn] /Users/rkuhn/comp/akka/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/dungeon/Children.scala:124: fruitless type test: a value of type akka.actor.dungeon.ChildrenContainer.SuspendReason cannot also be a akka.actor.dungeon.ChildrenContainer.WaitingForChildren
[warn]     case TerminatingChildrenContainer(_, _, w: WaitingForChildren) ⇒ w
[warn]                                                ^
```

You can see the full file here: https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/dungeon/Children.scala#L124

And the traits/classes involved are defined here: https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/dungeon/ChildrenContainer.scala#L45

My attempts at minimizing it have not been successful: I found that I can sometimes provoke it with the following two files in Eclipse, seeing the warning from the PC (i.e. not the build compiler), and the warning then goes away after a clean build:

```scala
package tester

object PatMatWarning {

  sealed trait X
  case object X1 extends X
  case object X2 extends X with Y

  trait Y

  case class Wrap(x: X)

}
```

```scala
package tester

class PatMatWarning2 {

  import PatMatWarning.{ Wrap, Y }

  def f(w: Wrap) = w match {
    case Wrap(_: Y) ⇒
  }

}
```

Having all within the same file never triggered the warning for me.
