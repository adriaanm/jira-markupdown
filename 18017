This does not compile:
`
    def crash[T : Numeric](evidence$1: Int) = println(evidence$1)
`

Error:
`
error: evidence$1 is already defined as value evidence$1
       def crash[T : Numeric](evidence$1: Int) = println(evidence$1)
           ^
`

It seems implicit evidence parameters should get some fresh name, or at least that `evidence$\d+` should be warned against.
