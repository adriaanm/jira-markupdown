Eclipse Version: 3.4.1

Build id: M20080911-1700

Scala plugin, 2.7.3.RC1

Scala seems to be inventing spurious package prefixes that aren't there on the imported class, then complains that they are bogus.

Copied from the Eclipse problems pane:
```scala
Description                                          Resource             Path                                                       Location	    Type
value lang is not a member of package com.sun.java   Modifiers.java       PFC/ProjectFortress/src/com/sun/fortress/nodes_util        Unknown        Scala Problem
```
For the source line
```scala
import static java.lang.Math.*;
```

Second example:
```scala
Description                                                                                   Resource                  Path                                                            Location  Type
SubtypeHistory is not a member of _root_.com.sun.fortress.compiler.typechecker.TypeAnalyzer   ConstraintFormula.java	PFC/ProjectFortress/src/com/sun/fortress/compiler/typechecker   Unknown   Scala Problem
```
For the source line
```scala
import com.sun.fortress.compiler.typechecker.TypeAnalyzer.SubtypeHistory;
```

This seems perhaps similar to bug scala/bug#1277, except that this is Java code, not Scala code.
