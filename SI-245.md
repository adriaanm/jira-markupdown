The method [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/symtab/Symbols.scala#L904 superSymbol] in the abstract class scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Symbols.Symbol should check the filtered baseClasses list for emptiness before tail is called on it. It currently may result in a 
{code}
java.util.NoSuchElementException: tail of empty list
{code}
if the symbol it is called on has no baseclasses (which usually would be the case if the symbol superSymbol gets called on is not a class symbol).
