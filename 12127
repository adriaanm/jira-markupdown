Once again we are left with the message that "Scalac occasionally does weird shit that only the high priests understand".

Over a year ago [@odersky said ](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2604122/scripting-jvm-languages/scala-founder-language-due-for-fundamental-rethink.html) "we want to eliminate some traps that people have found hard in Scala -- so-called puzzlers". Perhaps scalac should recognize specific situations such as this and respond by doing what likely makes most sense to a user, even if it is inconsistent in some more general theoretical sense.
