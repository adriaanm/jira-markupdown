In the following example, the {{ValDef}} for {{name = "Bob"}} and also the surrounding constructor {{DefDef}} and {{Block}} have an {{OffsetPosition}}, and not a {{RangePosition}} as I would have expected. 

{code:java}
trait Greeting {
  val name: String
  val msg = "How are you, "+name
}
class C(i: Int) extends {
  val name = "Bob"
} with Greeting {
  println(msg)
}
{code}
