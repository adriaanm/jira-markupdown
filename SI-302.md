Consider the following:

{code}
object Test {
  def test(x: => Unit)(y: Unit): String = "done"

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val t = test(println("never seen"))_
    println(t())
  }
}
{code}
This produces:
{code}
never seen
done
{code}
It should produce just:
{code}
done
{code}

scalac -Xprint:typer shows that the definition of t is compiled as:
{code}
val t: (Unit) => String = {
  <synthetic> val eta$$0$$1: Unit = scala.this.Predef.println("never seen");
  ((eta$$1$$1: Unit) => Test.this.test(eta$$0$$1)(eta$$1$$1))
};
{code}
This eta-expansion incorrectly ignores that the first parameter of test is call-by-name.


Here is another example, with some comments. I hope this makes my concerns clear and concrete:
{code}
object Test {
  def repeat(x: => Unit)(times: Int) = for (_ <- 1 to times) x

  def test() {
    // prints foo 5 times
    repeat(println("foo"))(5)
    
    // prints foo once
    val r = repeat(println("foo")) _
    // does not print anything
    r(5)
  }
}
{code}
If you don't find this behavior at all surprising, maybe you could provide some intuition for why it is correct?
You'd need to propose another spec for eta-expansion then. The compiler is faithful to the spec in 6.25.5. Note that mandating that cbn parameters themselves are lifted out with def instead of val is not enough. You'd still need to figure out how to do something like
{code}
val t = test(identity(println("never seen")))_
{code}
Reassigning to you, because I don't know a better solution.

Here's one possibility. Considering section 6.25.5, in the result of eta-conversion, change:
{code}
{ val x1 = e1;
  ...
  val xm = em;
  (y1:T1,...,yn:Tn) => e'(y1,...,yn)
}
{code}
with
{code}
{ val x1 = (() => e1);
  ...
  val xml = (() => em);
  ...
}
{code}
and in e', replace each ei by xi() rather than xi.

This has the effect of explicitly thunking each parameter, and then allowing the usual method call compilation to determine whether or not to unthunk them at call time.

If it is possible at expansion-time to inspect the type of the target method and determine which ei are in "by-name position" or whatever you want to call it, then this explicit thunking can be performed only for by-name parameters, eliminating the unnecessary overhead in the common case.

Also, if there is some other way of declaring first-class "by-name values," that might be preferred to thunks. IIRC there is no way of doing so, but perhaps internally to the compiler there is some trick available.

What do you think? I may try to have a go at implementing this, but it would be my first compiler change, so I won't make any promises. Also, if there is a better place to discuss this, please let me know.
Or maybe this is the same as lifting to defs rather than vals. I'm not sure I understand your identity example... Assuming identity is:
{{def identity[A](a: => A) = a}}
the def solution seems to work as I'd expect.


I thought a bit about this and it seems clear that the current behavior is wrong because it violates the expectation that 

{code}
(test { println("Test" } _)()
{code}

has the same result as

{code}
test { println("Test" }()
{code}

I.e. that you can either apply a function piece-wise partially or directly with all arguments and get the same result.

I think the solution as given by Matt is pretty good: at eta-expansion by-name parameters are lifted to vals of a thunk value (of type () => T). However, this is not a valid type to pass as a by-name argument so the application has to change from x1 to x1.apply() as well. If you do this naively the compiler will then (in uncurry) create another redundant thunk out of this application. I therefore propose another change where an expression f.apply() with f being an instance of Function0 in by-name-argument position isn't thunked but instead the application is removed and f passed directly. This should be a safe optimization in all cases because the generated thunk never does more than simple thunking.

The hard part of producing proper legalese for the scripture maybe isn't so hard at all because we have a precedent by now. This already is in "ยง6.6 Function Applications":

{quote}
The behavior of by-name parameters is preserved if the application is transformed into a block due to named or default arguments. In this case, the local value for that parameter has the form val y_i = () => e and the argument passed to the function is y_i ().
{quote}

We just have to amend the first sentence by "or eta-expansion". Problem solved.

If we can reach a consensus that this is the right approach I can put together a pull request with an implementation proposal.
See also SI-1247 for the optimization I proposed.
