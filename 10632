```scala
scala> trait Family[+Base] { type Family = Base }
<console>:7: error: covariant type Base occurs in invariant position in type Base of type Family
       trait Family[+Base] { type Family = Base }
                                  ^

scala> trait Family[+Base] { type Family = (Base @annotation.unchecked.uncheckedVariance) }
defined trait Family
```

Isn't this enough? We could disable the new check behind -Xsource:2.10 (I did that already for a few similarly strengthened checks.)
