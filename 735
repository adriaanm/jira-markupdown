yeah, it happens just by switching between java and scala buffers and doing random edits.  The problem occurs regardless of whether the java and scala files are in the same project or not.  After that error, all the keys intended for the foreground java buffer gets sent to the previous scala buffer that was switched away from.

Things are fine though when I use two windows, one exclusively for java, the other exclusively for scala....

I just switched to the Nightly build today, and things are working fine so far.

thanks,
