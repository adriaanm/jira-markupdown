Oh, maybe you are defining things differently. To me "bootstrapping" is an actually working scala on the other side of whatever invasive change requires a reference to bootstrapping. I wasn't trying to say that your bootstrapping infrastructure is necessarily the issue - although whether or not it is, the general difficulty identifying the complete set of inputs makes this sort of effort that much harder.
