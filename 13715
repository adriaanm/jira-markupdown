When running `ant newstarr` the build fails when trying to delete `lib\scala-library.jar`:
```scala

starr.start:

starr.clean:
Deleting: C:\Users\dragos\work\workspace\scala-15569\lib\scala-library.jar

BUILD FAILED
C:\Users\dragos\work\workspace\scala-15569\build.xml:1029: Unable to delete file
 C:\Users\dragos\work\workspace\scala-15569\lib\scala-library.jar
```

I set this to high-priority, as this is a show stopper for anyone who wants to do serious development on Windows. Feel free to disagree.
