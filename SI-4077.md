=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
   def iterate(col: java.util.Collection[Int]) = {
     val itr = col.iterator;
     while(itr.hasNext) {
         itr.next
     }
   }

...
import scala.collection.JavaConversions._
val lst: List[Int] = // long list
iterate(lst)
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The iterator should have a constant time 'next' operation. Even though it's not specified, it can be very surprising to have linear time per element when iterating over a list.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Linear time per element. It's because `JavaConversions.seqAsJavaList` uses `SeqWrapper`, which inherits the default `java.util.AbstractList` implementation for `iterator` (using `get`).

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6
  - Operating system: Mac OSX.
(In r23755) Make the java iterator wrapper linear time.
