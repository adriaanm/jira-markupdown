I'm trying to define a case class to represent a json object with a lot of fields (which I don't control).

case classes (and methods in general) can have up to 254 parameters, but Functions/Tuples can't, so these high-arity methods have no first-class counterpart.

{code}
scala> case class Foo(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int, d: Int, e: Int, f: Int, g: Int, h: Int, i: Int, j: Int, k: Int, l: Int, m: Int, n: Int, o: Int, p: Int, q: Int, r: Int, s: Int, t: Int, u: Int, v: Int, w: Int, x: Int, y: Int, z: Int, aa: Int, ab: Int, ac: Int, ad: Int, ae: Int, af: Int)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo.apply _
<console>:13: error: implementation restricts functions to 22 parameters
       Foo.apply _
           ^
{code}

codec derivations rely on {{apply}}/{{unapply}} so this is kind of a show-stopper.
When I got agreement to allow definition and pattern matching on 23+ param case classes, this was the big caveat, but it was discussed and accepted. We chose not to increase our function arity limit as a solution to the problem.

Code generators / Macros need can access the signature of the {{apply}} method in the companion object with:

{code}
scala> case class Many(_0: Int, _1: Int, _2: Int, _3: Int, _4: Int, _5: Int, _6: Int, _7: Int, _8: Int, _9: Int, _10: Int, _11: Int, _12: Int, _13: Int, _14: Int, _15: Int, _16: Int, _17: Int, _18: Int, _19: Int, _20: Int, _21: Int, _22: Int, _23: Int)
defined class Many

scala> typeOf[Many.type].member(TermName("apply")).info
res9: $r.intp.global.Type = (_0: Int, _1: Int, _2: Int, _3: Int, _4: Int, _5: Int, _6: Int, _7: Int, _8: Int, _9: Int, _10: Int, _11: Int, _12: Int, _13: Int, _14: Int, _15: Int, _16: Int, _17: Int, _18: Int, _19: Int, _20: Int, _21: Int, _22: Int, _23: Int)Many
{code}


What about the general Java interop issue? (Java methods of 0-22 parameters areÂ first-class in Scala, but methods of >22 aren't, right?)

I understand that this it's been discussed and accepted, but I wonder if folks continuing to ask about it might in itself be a reason to discuss it again.  Being forced to macros (experimental?) is a little scary/unlikely.  Did the previous discussion indicate a different future solution to the issue of not being able to interop with systems with >22 fields or >22 parameters?  

Cheers

Maybe not a great consolation, but if you'd prefer not to write the macros yourself you can uses shapeless's {{Generic}} as an alternative to {{apply}}/{{unapply}}.
