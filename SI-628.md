{code}
  case class Graph( count:Int, var tag:String )
  {
  }
  object Main 
  {
    def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
        val g = Graph( 4, "g" );
        g.tag = "hello";
    }
  }
{code}
Inside the main method, if I tried to do code completion on "g." by typing CTRL+SPACE;
the drop down menu offers two "tag" options.

This happens only when the 2nd parameter to the case class is marked *var*.

This is confusing.
The method is marked ACCESSOR and PARAMACCESSOR, and it's isGetter test is true.
the accessed field can be found by following the `accessed' link. So if you have two
members with the same name you can test them as follows:

if (m1.isGetter && m1.accessed == m2) // display only m1
