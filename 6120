It is a different bug than scala/bug#4703. This one is a missing MSVCR90.DLL dependency. 

I am not sure how prevalent systems with that missing dll are. I don't think the severity is major. 

I would suggest the following fix: if the exception (or root exception) on JLineReader instantiation has the following text *"This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect."*, then print *Downloading and installing the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package" may fix your issue.*

If you assign to me or to community, I would eventually find time to test and provide a patch to that effect. By that time we may have more feedback on how many are affected. There is a vote link in this issue tracker so people can up vote if they feel it's important.
