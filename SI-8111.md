It seems as I have caught something like a bug in Scala compiler. It is thrown both in 2.10.3 and 2.10.4-RC1.

Just try to compile attached file 'Monads.scala'. 

In my environment it throws:

unhandled exception while transforming Monads.scala
[error] uncaught exception during compilation: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
[trace] Stack trace suppressed: run last compile:compile for the full output.
[error] (compile:compile) java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not find proxy for ma: Object in List(value ma, method flatMap, class Monad$class, object Monads, package <empty>, package <root>) (currentOwner= method apply )

Full stack trace is shown there:

Sorry, if it is something known already or my own mistake. Thanks.
Appears to have regressed in 2.10.0, specifically in SI-5720 / https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/aabe71f
Minimized:

{code}
trait T {

  def crashy(ma: Any) {
    // okay
    val f1 = (u: Unit) => ma
    foo(f1)()

    // okay
    foo((u: Unit) => ma)

    // okay
    foo((u: Unit) => ma)(())

    // crash
    foo((u: Unit) => ma)()
    ???
  }

  def foo(f: Any): Any => Any
}
{code}
The problem is that the compiler first tries named/default arguments to correct the arity mismatch in:

{code}
foo((u: Unit) => ma).apply()
{code}

We need one argument, but an empty argument list is provided.

This doesn't pan out, and it then falls back to autotupling which reinterprets the empty argument list as a `Tuple0`, better know as `()`.

But, the names/default transform leaves a trace on the tree by way of the side-effect of changing the owner of the symbol representing the closure to the symbol of a temporary val `qual$1` emitted in the transform:

{code}
{
  val qual$1: Any => Any @uncheckedBounds = T.this.foo(((u: Any) => ma));
  qual$1.apply
}
{code}

That temporary val is part of the rigmarole needed to maintain the correct evaluation order in `first.foo(x = second, y = third)`.

We should restructure the `tryNamesDefaults` to avoid the destructive `changeOwner` until we're sure that the names/defaults approach will work out.

I'm sure that we've got another instance of this bug reported, but I can't find it right now.
