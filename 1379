This ought to be fixed in r17238.  I also had to unroll ExceptionInInitializerErrors because of the way the interpreter works.
{code}
scala> throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument foo has the wrong type", new ClassCastException)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: argument foo has the wrong type
	at .<init>(<console>:5)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
{code}
