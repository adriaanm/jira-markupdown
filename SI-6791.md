This program should not warn about the abstract type being eliminated by erasure because we are testing for a more specific type than the one which is eliminated by erasure - it is a test which we can perform.
```scala
object Foo {
  def f[T <: AnyRef](x: Any, y: T) = x match {
    case _: y.type => true
  }
}
```
As it stands, I don't think this warning is bogus, because `unsafeCoerce` can be derived in a couple ways from testing singleton types by trusting `equals`:

```scala
package test.sixtysevenninetyone

object UCs {
  abstract class Ooh[+A] extends Tuple1[Unit](()) {
    val phantom: A
  }
  def ooh[A](a: => A): Ooh[A] = new Ooh[A]{lazy val phantom = a}

  def uc1[A, B]: A =:= B = {
    val aa = ooh(implicitly[A =:= A])
    val no = ooh(???)
    aa match {case ano: no.type => ano.phantom}
  }

  import collection.mutable.Buffer

  def uc2[A, B]: A =:= B = {
    val es = Buffer[A =:= B]()
    val gs = Buffer[A =:= A]()
    (gs: Buffer[_]) match {
      case es: es.type => gs += implicitly; es.head
    }
  }

  def oops = (uc1[String, ClassLoader]("twenty-one"),
              uc2[String, ClassLoader]("forty-two"))
}
```

Yielding session (excluding uninteresting warnings about subclassing tuple; the basic principle of getting `equals` to lie has wide application):

```scala

Also as in 2.10.3.
It doesn't matter if equals lies, the pattern match in this ticket should never even call equals. The match is only supposed to happen if x is reference equal to y, which will make it difficult to introduce unsoundness based on the type of y.

There is definitely grave unsoundness related to trusting equals - #1503 is the main ticket - this is not that. See #4577, which I marked as a "blocker" at some point, ha ha.
