I have to disagree with the categorization of this issue as "Minor". Not properly escaping attributes means that scala.xml does not comply to the xml spec. This should be very easy to fix, but to work around this issue is a *major* pain in the ass.

So why not just fix this? I know scala.xml is on the way to deprecation. But a lot of people are still using it. Especially given that there is no official replacement, and it is still shown in the examples in all the books such as "Programming in Scala".
