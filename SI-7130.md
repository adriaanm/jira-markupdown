In Types.scala we have the following [code](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/bafebe1c161f8db0be758c30fe5cc51082a56427/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Types.scala#L7157):
```scala
  Statistics.newView("#unique types") { if (uniques == null) 0 else uniques.size }
```

Let's have a closer look at [{{Statistics.newView}}](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/bafebe1c161f8db0be758c30fe5cc51082a56427/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/util/Statistics.scala#L88):
```scala
def newView(prefix: String, phases: String*)(quant: => Any): View = new View(prefix, phases, quant)
```

As you can see `newView` takes by-name argument (that in our case closes over the whole Global) and passes it to `View`.

The `View` class inherits from Quantity that is defined as follows:
```scala
  trait Quantity {
    if (prefix.nonEmpty) {
      val key = s"${if (underlying != this) underlying.prefix else ""}/$prefix"
      qs(key) = this
    }
    val prefix: String
    val phases: Seq[String]
    def underlying: Quantity = this
    def showAt(phase: String) = phases.isEmpty || (phases contains phase)
    def line = f"$prefix%-30s: ${this}"
    val children = new mutable.ListBuffer[Quantity]
  }
```

So we register `this` in global (defined in top-level object) HashMap stored in variable `qs`. The consequence is that even if you don't use Global it'll be still hanging there because Statistics holds reference to it. This is a memory leak that I observed while using Scala IDE where Global used for compiling the code was kept around and consumed aroung 0.5GB of heap.
The simple solution to avoid memory leak is to turn *all* operations in Statistics into no-ops in case statistics is disabled.

However, the whole design is broken because it doesn't work across many Globals. Also, life cycle of that top-level object is not clear to me since you can mutate `enabled` flag at any time.
