A multi-line string literal should return whatever you put between the quotes.  If you get \r\n in there, that's what you should get.  If it's \n, same deal.  The job of multi-line string literals is not to translate what's between the quotes, it's to *be literal*.

And that's exactly what it does.  If you put \r\n in with your editor, you'll get that.  If \n, that.  If you want to write on a platform that does one and parse lines on something that does the other, parse the lines using something that knows how to parse lines (e.g. call `lines` on the margin-stripped string).  It's a bit annoying, but pretty much *everything* works that way in Java (and Scala's IO basically comes from Java).
