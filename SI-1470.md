Neither or both of the following should work, but having one working and not the other is inconsistent:

```scala
scala> new Array[AnyVal](2)   
res0: Array[AnyVal] = Array(null, null)

scala> res0(0)
res1: AnyVal = null
```

```scala
scala> val x : AnyVal = null 
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Null(null)
 required: AnyVal
       val x : AnyVal = null
```

Postponed until we know more about non-nullable types. The problem also appears in other situations, e.g.

```scala
var x: AnyVal = _
```
huge 2016 thread on this at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-user/VRmZ-XrFr0U/zFWJKUovBgAJ . most of the thread is about shenanigans involving `asInstanceOf`, but you don't actually need `asInstanceOf` to get into trouble.

one of the "other situations" Lukas mentions is with generic types:

```scala
scala> class Sloppy[A] { var value: A = _ }
defined class Sloppy

scala> new Sloppy[Double].value
res14: Double = 0.0

scala> new Sloppy[Double].value: Any
res15: Any = null

scala> new Sloppy[Double].value: AnyVal
res16: AnyVal = null

scala> println(new Sloppy[Double].value)
null
```
maybe we should just deprecate this `= _` thing. the only time it means something you can really count on is for AnyRef types, in which case you might as well write `= null`, rather than sneak a null into your program without actually writing "null" into the source. and if someone wants the Any/AnyVal behavior they can always write `= null.asInstanceOf[T]`, raising explicit two red flags right there in the source — again, less sneaking.
Specialization changes the behavior:

object GenInitApp extends App {

  class Unspecialized[T] { var x: T = _ }
  class Specialized[@specialized(Float) T] { var x: T = _ }

  println("Unspecialized x is " + (new Unspecialized[Float]).x)
  println("Specialized x is " + (new Specialized[Float]).x)

}

  Output is:

Unspecialized x is null
Specialized x is 0.0

Without default value syntax, you can't distinguish default value from "reset".
```scala
var x: String = if (x == null) null else x  // don't munge early setting
```
I was just looking at a field that was side-effected from early definition, so the explicit definition would have to be early, too, and not just earlier in the template body.

The comment on the warning:

bq. `val bar: X = bar`, which come up more frequently than you might think.
