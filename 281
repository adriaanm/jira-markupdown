I changed my mind.  If the main point of this bug is to complain about the crash on disallowed syntax in existentials, it is a duplicate of SI-318.  But if the bug is about being about to use view bounds in existentials then it is an enhancement rather than a defect.  That is, assuming there is not a technical reason for disallowing view bounds in existentials.
