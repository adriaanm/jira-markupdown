With my XMPP server I am unable to do this:

# Send request to server
# Wait for response (final stream in node)
# Send repsonse based on entire final XML tag in response.

It will block forever before I can determine the final tag in the stream is closed... at best I can't make my second request knowing I've got the full information to respond to.
