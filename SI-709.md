Right now there is no way to know if a method has been tail call optimized without inspecting compiler output (either printing trees after a certain phase, or looking at bytecode). A warning should be generated for tail recursive methods that can't be optimized. This is most likely what the user wants, and because the method was not final. 

There should be two annotations, `@tc` and `@notc`:
 * A method annotated with `@tc` will cause an _error_ to be issued if the method does not contain at least one tail call that was optimized. 
 * An method with neiher annotation will trigger a _warning_ if a tail recursive call can't be optimized.
 * A method annotated with `@notc` will disable the above warning and suppress tail call optimization for that method.
+1 to give a name that is more obvious.
