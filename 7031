Minimized a bit further:
```scala
def foo(p: => Any)(implicit x: Nothing): Unit = ()

object X

foo {
  val a = 0
  
  {
    import X._
    a
  }
}
```

The bug hits in erroneous code, when an implicit parameter cannot be found.

Like the original example, this works with 2.10. So a test case would close this.
