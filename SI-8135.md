As [this PR demonstrates](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3275#issuecomment-31986434), there is a race condition when `askTypeAt(pos)` is called on `implicitly[Foo[A]].foo` where `pos` is matches the end point of the former expression. The issue is that the returned Tree is unattributed, which is why the error `No symbol is associated with tree implicitly[Foo[A]].foo` is reported.

I'm going to move the spuriously failing test in `pending`, but would be good to look at it at some point.
I can reproduce it locally by making a bunch of copies of the test and letting partest have at them:

```
 % for i in {1..20}; do cp -R test/files/presentation/context-bounds1 test/files/presentation/context-bounds1_$i; cp test/files/presentation/context-bounds1.check test/files/presentation/context-bounds1_$i.check; done
% ./test/partest test/files/presentation/context-bounds1_*

When it works, we see this tree as found by `interactive.Global#signalDone`

```scala
scala.this.Predef.implicitly[Foo[A]](evidence$7).foo
```

When it fails, we see:

```scala
implicitly[Foo[A]].foo(x$7)
```

Find the "x$7", and we'll be close the the culprit. Hopefully this will just entail a refinement of the fix for #7558.
