there seems to be more problems with the current Enumeration implementation. Adding some `println` to the `Val` constructor reveals that this one runs much more often than expected. Also the following:

{code}
scala> object t extends Enumeration { val a, b = Value }
defined module t

scala> t.values
res0: t.ValueSet = t.ValueSet(a, b)

scala> t.values
res1: t.ValueSet = t.ValueSet(a, b, Value)
{code}
