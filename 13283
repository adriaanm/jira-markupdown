If I type these two lines into the Scala interpreter they work fine:

{code}
implicit def iterableWithSum(it: Iterable[Int]) = new { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
println((1 to 10).sum)
{code}

but with the same two lines in a script, I get:


{code}
(fragment of foo.scala):2: error: value sum is not a member of Range.Inclusive
println((1 to 10).sum)
{code}
