Note that this bug is actually much harder to workaround than I made it sound above. e.g. it will also break if you have something like (because of the Boolean in the signature):

{code}
trait Baz2[A] extends (A => Boolean)

class Foo2 {
  def l(b: Baz2[String]) { }
}
{code}

It turns out that scala.collection.Set has that issue because the signature is:

{code}
trait Set[A] extends (A => Boolean) with Collection[A] {
{code}

Other classes in the standard library may also be affected.
