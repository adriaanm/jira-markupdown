Hi,

The {{scala.util.parsing.combinator}} library should provide a way of turning on case insensitive matches; having to prefix every string with a (?i) isn't ideal. E.g., {{"""(?iu)\|H""".r}}, just ends up cluttering up the code.
+1 on this one.

One option would be a new parser method, analogous to the `literal` method in , `caseInsensitiveLiteral`, for example, that would match strings without comparing case.

Thanks
