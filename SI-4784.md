File test1.scala:
```scala
trait Foo { this: Bar => def foo = 7 }
trait Bar extends Foo
```

File test2.scala:
```scala
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    new Bar { }
  }
}
```

Compile and run:
```scala
$scalac test1.scala
$scalac test2.scala
$scala Test
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Foo$class.$init$(LFoo;)V
	at Test$$anon$1.<init>(test2.scala:3)
	at Test$.main(test2.scala:3)
	at Test.main(test2.scala)
```

Javap reveals that method `Foo$class.$init$` is generated with parameter type `Bar` not `Foo`. Compiling both files together works fine. 
I checked again with the prebuilt nightly and indeed, no problem there. It turns out that in the build I used previously, I had disabled the check that prevents loading `XX$class.class` files (see #4767). Consequently, using the nightly, this one fails for `scalac -Yinline` (curiously enough not for `-optimize` ??).
Just tried with several combinations of `-Yinline` for `test1.scala` and `test2.scala`, as well as with and without `-optimize`, against [026a70d55591c3b5ee157e22998b62168afee686 ](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/026a70d55591c3b5ee157e22998b62168afee686). In all cases there was no `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError`.
