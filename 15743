Similar to how filesystem paths start with / when they are absolute, why can't import specifications start with a dot instead of !__root!__ ?  !__root!__ is fine, but too long

Example: instead of /in addition to 
{code}
import __root__.package1.package2 
{code}
support using 

{code}
import .package1.package2 //absolute, note the first dot 
{code}
