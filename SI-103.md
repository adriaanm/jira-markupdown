The scala.actors.Actor object causes memory leak because it stores an ActorProxy in thread-local storage and this reference is never cleaned.

Here's a relevant part of the Actor object source:

  def self: Actor = {
    var a = tl.get.asInstanceOf[Actor]
    if (null eq a) {
      a = new ActorProxy(currentThread)
      tl.set(a)
    }
    a
  }

The memory leak can be caused by a thread calling Actor.self or Actor.resetProxy.   If this thread is never itself dereferenced -- as is the case in many applications servers that use thread-pooling -- then the entire Scala library will be retained in memory.

This is an important problem when deploying Scala actor-based applications on applications servers (e.g. Lift framework on top of Jetty/Tomcat) because it eventually prevents hot-swapping the application code due to running out of "PermSpace"; Scala library classes are never reclaimed by the garbage collector despite the use of classloader hierarchies to support code hot-swap capability.

To avoid the memory leak you mention, it is indeed necessary to provide a method that let's the user release the reference. I added the {{clearSelf}} method to the {{Actor}} object that clears any {{self}} reference stored in thread-local storage.
