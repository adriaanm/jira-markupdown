This isn't a bug, not in scala anyway. You can't expect to compile against version 4.1 of a library  and deploy against version 4.0, not if they're not binary compatible, which they aren't. You were getting away with it through a combination of bugs and happenstance. As you describe it, the current behavior is correct and the old behavior was wrong.

Why aren't you building against 4.0 to deploy against 4.0?
