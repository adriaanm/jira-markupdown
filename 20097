Making a computation on a collection parallel is currently easy to do in-line:

{code:scala}
collection.par.code.to.parallelize...
{code}

But if I want to modify the threading, that breaks up the flow of the code:

{code: scala}
val pcoll = collection.par

pcoll.tasksupport = // annoying!

pcoll.code.to.parallelize...
{code}

I am proposing a couple variants on {{par}} that make this cleaner:

{code: scala}
// parallelize with 5 threads
collection.parUsing(5).code.to.parallelize...

// paralllelize with my thread pool
collection.parUsing(myPool).code.to.parallelize...
{code}
