(extempore in [r25848|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25848]) Fixing valueOfTerm in the repl.

Impressed at the amount of ticket traffic for an unadvertised internal
method.  All the more reason to work toward that support repl API.
Don't worry, it'll come.  Closes scala/bug#4899, no review.
