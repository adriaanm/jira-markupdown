That's true, working with wrong or ambiguous names is undesirable.  This is a real bummer though.  It dramatically improves the readability of calls into java, particularly for String and Boolean arguments.  It would be great to at least open some way for motivated persons to take advantage of named arguments - I would gladly write a source transformer and run it over the whole source base, so wrong/ambiguous names would not be a big concern.  The scala philosophy is ostensibly to not be so keen to protect me from myself that I can't do the useful thing I want to do.
