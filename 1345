The "is not a member of package " bug appears on packages rooted in more than one place.

e.g.

X.jar has package x.y.z.bob
Y.jar has package x.y.z.carol

I get the an error message if I do an import
import x.y.z.carol._

if I fix this to be 
import x.y.z.carol.{Ted,Alice}

then the error symbol disappears but the pink line and error warning message remain
