When invoking fsc by the compilation of a script fsc creates a /tmp/scala-devel directory that is writable only by the user.
A second user is not able to compile his scripts on the same machine. She gets the error: "Could not find a directory for temporary files".

in CompileSocket.scala

/** A temporary directory to use */
  val tmpDir = {
    val udir  = Option(Properties.userName) getOrElse "shared"
    val f     = (Path(Properties.tmpDir) / "scala-devel" / udir).createDirectory()
    
    if (f.isDirectory && f.canWrite) {
      info("[Temp directory: " + f + "]")
      f
    }
    else fatal("Could not find a directory for temporary files")
  }

adding something like:
new java.io.File(Path(Properties.tmpDir) / "scala-devel").setWritable(true,false)
would maybe help.

easier would be to get rid of common machine level folder and create only user specific folders.

val f = (Path(Properties.tmpDir) / "scala-devel-" + udir).createDirectory()
