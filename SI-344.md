I'm attaching two small sample projects, one in Scala and one in Java. The Java project has a Test class which calls out to Scala's TestClass. It compiles and runs, but the Eclipse editor puts red error markers next to the import and the instantiation of the Scala class. Screenshot attached. I tried cleaning the project, closing the project, and restarting Eclipse. Same behavior. Tried Mac OS Eclipse 3.4M1 (Leopard 10.5.1, Apple JVM 1.5.0_13) and Windows Eclipse 3.3.1.1 (XP, Sun JVM 1.5.0_13). Same behavior. Completely reproducible, just import these two projects into a new workspace with the Scala plugin installed.

Probably for a related same reason, Eclipse autoimport feature does not pick up Scala packages.

Note: Java projects want scala-library.jar explicitly imported. Exporting the Scala runtime from a Scala library doesn't work for some reason. So the Java project will have a build path entry pointing to my installation of the Scala Plugin. You'll have to change this to make the workspace work.
Those two projects work for me if I configure the Java builder for the Scala project correctly. To do this, right context menu click on the Scala project in the Package explorer, then Properties => Java Compiler => Building, then enable project specific settings, followed by disabling "Scrub output folders when cleaning projects" and add *.scala as a filtered resource.

These settings should have been selected if the Scala project was created using the New Scala Project wizard but won't have been if the project was created by hand.
