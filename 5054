quick notes from discussion:
* intuitively, you could use the `from` argument in `CanBuildFrom` to initialize the new collection with the same data that should be propagated -- HOWEVER
* what to do when you map to a new kind of collection
* when you map to the same kind of collection (and it's a map), you could use the mapping function to determine the new default for the new map, but this behaviour would be different and/or impossible for other from/to pairs in collections

Alex will elaborate and document (what gets propagated, what doesn't and why it can't)
