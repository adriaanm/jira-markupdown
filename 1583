I am becoming frustrated with this bug, but someone else who picks it up should note this:
{code}
% scalac -Ylog:jvm T.scala
// if P is not private
[log jvm] Generating method C.P
// but if P is private
[log jvm] Generating method C.C$$$$P
{code}
It all seems to tie into EXPANDEDNAME (I'm not shouting, it's a flag.)
