The result make the warning obviously wrong:

scala> case class C(val s: Int*)
defined class C

scala> new C(1, 3, 7) == new C(1, 3, 7)
<console>:10: warning: comparing a fresh object using `==' will always yield false
              new C(1, 3, 7) == new C(1, 3, 7)
                             ^
res4: Boolean = true
