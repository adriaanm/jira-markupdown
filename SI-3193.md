Maybe this is related to the implementation of clone() casting to whatever you tell it?
{code}
trait Cloneable[+A <: AnyRef]  {
  override def clone: A = super.clone().asInstanceOf[A]
}
{code}
I should point out that specifying a concrete type for clone() is not a solution because a method like ++ is implemented as "clone() ++= x" and on Set for example ++ returns "This", so that implementation won't work unless clone() also returns "This".
(In r22470) Normalized protected type aliases before repl printing, so we
don't see things like x.Self.  Closes SI-3193, no review.
