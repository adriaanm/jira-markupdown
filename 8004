But so does this
```
scala> def f(xs: (List[T] forSome {type T})): List[T forSome {type T}] = xs
f: (xs: List[_])List[T forSome { type T }]

scala> def f(xs: List[T forSome {type T}]): (List[T] forSome {type T}) = xs
f: (xs: List[T forSome { type T }])List[_]
```

and List[T] forSome {type T} is not the same as List[T forSome {type T}] because
List[T] forSome {type T} is equivalent to List[_] and List[T forSome {type T}] is not equivalent to List[_]
