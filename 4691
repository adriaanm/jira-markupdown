(In r24461) Addresses the issues swirling around Double.Epsilon and friends
which were battled out in more than one venue and then aptly summarized
by retronym in scala/bug#3791.  Thanks to Simon Ochsenreither for submitting
a patch; I wasn't able to use too much of it because the source
code for these types is generated, but effort is always
appreciated.  Closes scala/bug#3791, and I'm tired and I'd hate to blow
this one at this late date: review by rytz.
