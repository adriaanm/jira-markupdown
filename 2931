Anti-xml does not look to strive to backward compatibility so for my current projects I am afraid it is not an option. Is the XML handling by the compiler (literals, matching) pluggable at all?

To be honest, although the API is a bit odd at places scala.xml suits most of my needs. If only this issue would be fixed I would be quite happy to keep using it.

If I had to guess I would think it would take little more than replacing a HashMap with a LinkedHashMap or something like that. Is this issue currently assigned to anyone at all?
