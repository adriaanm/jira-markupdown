SI-6562 Assume less about the name of the OUTER_LOCAL â€¦
Since 07f9429, the name of this field can be expanded.
Not sure which is the best way around this:

  - avoid expanding synthetic names in `makeNonPrivate`?
  - try with/withou the same expansion in `outerField`?
  - loosen the member lookup `name.endsWith(OUTER_LOCAL)`

For now, I've gone with the last choice.
