The following code creates a spurious warning (because of the concatenated string):
```scala
@implicitNotFound("not found ${H}‚Äù+".") trait X[H]
```
```scala
possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
[warn] @implicitNotFound("not found ${H}"+".") trait X[H]
```

The warning disappears if we write
```scala
@implicitNotFound("not found ${H}.") trait X[H]
```

In my original code I broke the message in 2 because it was too long.
