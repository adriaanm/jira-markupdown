The following code creates a spurious warning (because of the concatenated string):
{code}
@implicitNotFound("not found ${H}‚Äù+".") trait X[H]
{code}

{code}
possible missing interpolator: detected an interpolated expression
[warn] @implicitNotFound("not found ${H}"+".") trait X[H]
{code}

The warning disappears if we write
{code}
@implicitNotFound("not found ${H}.") trait X[H]
{code}

In my original code I broke the message in 2 because it was too long.
