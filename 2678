I think the reporter was expecting the objects to inherit the "caseyness" and behave as case objects. Compare the following which uses case objects instead of vanilla objects and behaves as was expected,
```scala
miles@lewis:~$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.5.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java
1.6.0_14).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> abstract case class Foo(a : Int)
defined class Foo

scala> case object X extends Foo(10){val b = 20}
defined module X

scala> case object Y extends Foo(10){val c = 30}
defined module Y

scala> X == Y
res0: Boolean = false
```

Somewhat to my suprise there doesn't seem to be any mention of the semantics of case objects in the SLS.
