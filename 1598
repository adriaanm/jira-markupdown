I can reproduce what you're seeing with those steps, but all I infer from that is an illustration of binary incompatibility across different scala versions (which I see all the time) which I would not characterize as "separate compilation broken".  Yes, if I use a recent scalac to compile Types it won't work with the older code, but it works if I compile it separately with build/quick/bin/scalac, which is as much as I have come to expect.  Am I missing something?

I know for sure my fix to scala/bug#1535 broke binary compatibility - that's too recent to be the issue here, but it's an example of why I don't see this as unexpected.
