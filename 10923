Jason: Just to refresh my memory: this project shows code that is fast with 2.10.4 but slow with 2.11.x

cvogt: no. Slow with 2.10.4
removing this line makes it fast: https://github.com/cvogt/slick-presentation/blob/tmp/hlistSpeed/src/main/scala/SlickPresentation.scala#L12
which is odd
that's the problem.
why does this line make it slow?

Jason: Okay, then maybe there are two problems that this exposes...
I'm bisecting the problem that it is massively slow in 2.11

It got slow after this "refactoring": https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/9c09c170998f74fba03990977b285e3121db32a6#diff-7c03397456d3b987549fd039d6b639c6L667
But I remember that line, and it was since reverted as part of SI-6966
so I need to see if it sped up again at that point...
sigh...

cvogt: thanks man :-\

Jason: The reversion, https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/58bfa19, doesn't restore performance. Maybe that line wasn't the culprit.
