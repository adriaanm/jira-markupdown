I tried, but my perfect record of "if they mention maven, trying to reproduce will be a total waste of time" remains unblemished.  After downloading the internet I get 103 errors, the first of which is that "iterator is not a member of Iterable" so I assume that means it's trying to use 2.7 to compile.
