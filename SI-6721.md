In the following code, I do not really care about type X, except as necessary to prove evidence of a classmanifest. 

```scala
import scala.{ specialized => spec }

object Test {
  def smap[@spec(Unit) X: ClassManifest,
           @spec(Double) T,
           @spec(Double) U: ClassManifest](s: Series[X, T], f: T => U): Series[X, U] = {
    Series[X,U](s.values.map(f), s.index)
  }
}
```

Nevertheless, I must specialize X to have the entire function specialize at all. This leads to a warning that seems unavoidable, but also not correct.

```scala
