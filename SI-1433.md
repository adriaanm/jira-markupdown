This is really bizarre, but the uninstaller.jar installed by the scala IzPack installer (/usr/local/Uninstaller/uninstaller.jar) will delete /usr/local/share/X11/xkb/compiled when uninstalling scala. The installer doesn't install any files into /usr/local/share/X11, so I have no idea why the uninstaller touches here at all. Modify dates suggest it may have done other things in /usr/local/share/X11/xkb/ and /usr/local/share/X11/doc/.

Deleting the compiled directory breaks xkb and causes X11 to not handle the keyboard correctly (windows keys and delete broke for me). Luckily a simple mkdir will fix the problem.

Also, the suggestion that /usr/local/ be forcibly removed when uninstalling borders on the terrifying. I get the impression the installer was not intended for Linux/UNIX. I am running FreeBSD 7 though I doubt the specific OS matters.

Scala runs very nicely, though I think I will stick with the plain tarball!
The version of the installer previously in use was rather old; a much more recent version of the installer has been included in our upcoming 2.8 distribution,and that should address these issues.

In particular, the IzPack installer is really designed for private user installations, rather than by root. The default installation directory on *nix used to be /usr/local for every user, but that was changed in a subsequent release of the IzPack installer so that non-administrators are presented with a local default.

Issue is fixed as of r19008 and r19011. The installer, as configured, could not really be used to install stuff safely in `/usr/local`. The layout of the files installed by the installer has been reorganized on *nix and OSX: all will be created in a separate `[path]/scala` directory (`/usr/local/scala` for root, `~/scala` for other users). A stern warning will appear if a user tries to store files in a potentially dangerous location. Also, on OSX the installer no longer tries to install files in `/usr/local` or in `/Applications`.

These fixes will appear in 2.8; they are also likely to appear in the next stable 2.7.x revision, although no final decision has been made at this stage.
As a final followup to this ticket, I should clarify that we only encountered the issue as submitted by the original poster; no actual files were ever removed during our tests.

The issue apparently stems from a "feature" of the IzPack installer package. In short, rather than keeping track of the files and directories that were created during the installation, the uninstaller just removes all of the installed files first, and then perform a cleanup phase by removing the empty directories that are left around.

If the installation directory chosen for the installation is not empty, however, then some unrelated empty subdirectories of the same directory may be erroneously purged when the uninstaller is used, due to the aforementioned behavior. This issue may only arise on *nix or OS X machines on which the jar installer was used for the installation; Windows systems are not affected. A workaround and various improvements were added to the IzPack installer in Scala 2.7.7.RC2 and later.
