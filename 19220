I put together a gist which demonstrates the issue: https://gist.github.com/wheaties/7192b40b76cb99e79127

The same issue exists both in SBT and at compile time. Essentially by instantiating a class containing a dependent type through the use of dependent types, that type is lost. If, instead the same object is created directly, the type information is preserved. 

It is similar to scala/bug#5700 with one exception, an explicit type is given always.
