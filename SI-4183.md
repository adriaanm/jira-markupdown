A problem [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/34969 discussed] on the scala user mailing list, details a problem when an actor links to a function object. The function object will be wrapped in an actor **B**, which then get linked to the actor **A** that initiated the linking.

The problem though, is that actor **A** will begin processing messages before actor **B** has started. If actor **A** fails, then actor **B** might not receive the termination message. This calls into question the idea of using function objects in the first place, since this can lead to timing issues.

Are there any use-cases where link using function objects make sense? Maybe link should be restricted to actor objects only, since this will give you better control over initialization.

=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===
```scala
import scala.actors._
import scala.actors.Actor._

object ActorBug1 {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val a = actor {
      link {
        println("linked to monitor " + self.hashCode)
        self.trapExit = true
        loop { react {
          case Exit(from: Actor, exp: UncaughtException) =>
            println("restarted " + from.hashCode + " in monitor " +
            self.hashCode)
            from.restart()
```
      }
      println("started " + self.hashCode)
      loop { react {
        case n: Int =>
          println("handling " + n)
          throw new Exception(n.toString)
```scala
    }

    (1 to 10).foreach(i => { println("sending " + i); a ! i} )
  }
}
```


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The linked actor should have trapped the terminated actor it was embedded inside.

=== What do you see instead? ===
The linked actor failed to trap the terminated actor because the execution of its body happend at a later time.

```scala
started 11245030
sending 1
linked to monitor 13446204
sending 2
sending 3
sending 4
sending 5
sending 6
sending 7
sending 8
sending 9
sending 10
handling 1
restarted 11245030 in monitor 13446204
started 11245030
handling 2
linked to monitor 25853693
```

=== Additional information ===
[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/34969]

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6
  - Operating system: Windows 7 32-bit
This behavior is as expected. Since the actor created using `link` runs asynchronously, it is possible that `self.trapExit` is set too late, and therefore the `Exit` message is not received.
