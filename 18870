scalac can parse Java sources to break cycles in mixed Scala/Java projects. However, the typer complains about correct (from the Java point of view) imports in Java sources:

{code}
package p1;
public class EnclosingClass {
	public class NestedClass {
	}
}
{code}

{code}
import p1.EnclosingClass.NestedClass;
public class ConsumingClass {
	NestedClass nc;
}
{code}

This results in:

{code}
NestedClass is not a member of _root_.p1.EnclosingClass.
{code}
