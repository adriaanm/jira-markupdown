First, apologies in advance - this is my first ever Scala program, so the possibility I am doing something stupid is quite high.

A rambling account of what happened is at http://www.acooke.org/cute/StartingaS0.html

In short, I added a "hello world" object to a project structure generated by sbt, from within Eclipse.  When I try to run that code as a Scala Application in Eclipse I have two problems:

1 - The auto-generated run configuration has the last character missing ("HelloWorl" in stead of "HelloWorld") in both the title and the main class

2 - When I correct the above, and try to run I get "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main" in the Eclipse Console.

I am using Eclipse 3.5.1 with JDK 1.6.0_16.  The SBT version is 0.5.3

The Scala Eclipse plugin is 2.7.6 final.  I also have IvyDev and Pydev plugins installed.

The HelloWorld class code is:
{code}
package main.scala

object HelloWorld {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("hello world")
  }
  
}
{code}
The classpath seems just fine.

Running from within sbt does work:
{code}

I will also include some screenshots.
Ok, thanks.

If you can establish that there's some poor interaction between the Scala IDE and sbt/ivy which is best fixed in the IDE rather than in sbt/ivy, then please create a new ticket with the relevant details.
