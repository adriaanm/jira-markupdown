In the following, both f1 and f2 receive incorrect unreachable warnings.  In the second variation, the warning is completely unpositioned - it literally just emits "warning: unreachable code".  Since the file I was compiling at the time had about a thousand pattern matches in it, I was reminded of the value of accurate positions.
```scala
class A {
  def f1(x: Int) = x match {
    case _ if false => x
    case 5          => x
  }
  // patmat.scala:4: warning: unreachable code
  //     case 5          => x
  //                        ^
  def f2(x: Int) = x match {
    case _ if false => x
    case 5 if true  => x
  }
  // warning: unreachable code
}
```
Oh I see, you're letting literal false have "false.type" and not boolean.  Technically you're right.  Traditionally we don't utilize that information, because a guard of "if true" or "if false" almost certainly represents some kind of debugging.

It is like, if every time you saw

  if (false && condition) { ... }

You said "Warning! Block of code will never execute!" Well yeah, that's why I put "if (false)" in there, you don't need to hassle me about it scalac.

I could go either way on this, but in the absence of someone identifying a plausible case where this is helpful, I'd say the type of the guard should be widened.
And maybe this was included in "positions debacle" but the one warning which is positioned is positioned on the wrong line entirely (otherwise I might have noticed what it was doing.)
yeah, that was happening because i was checking unreachability after pushing guards into the bodies of switch cases, so that then it looked like there was an unguarded default followed by another case
just to be sure

```scala
def test1(x: Int) = x match {
  case c if c < 0 => 0
  case 1          => 1
  case _          => 2
}
```
