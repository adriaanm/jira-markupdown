Java:
{code}
synchronized boolean f() { return false; }
// produces
synchronized int f();
   0:	iconst_0
   1:	ireturn
{code}
Scala:
{code}
def f(): Boolean = synchronized { false }
// produces
public boolean f();
   0:	aload_0
   1:	dup
   2:	astore_1
   3:	monitorenter
   4:	iconst_0
   5:	invokestatic	#21; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToBoolean:(Z)Ljava/lang/Boolean;
   8:	astore_2
   9:	aload_1
   10:	monitorexit
   11:	aload_2
   12:	invokestatic	#25; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.unboxToBoolean:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Z
   15:	ireturn
   16:	aload_1
   17:	monitorexit
   18:	athrow
{code}
I don't know if hand-rolling the monitor is slower than marking the method synchronized, although I think it's a good bet that it is.  I do know that boxing and unboxing the boolean to get it in and out of synchronized is slower than not doing so.
There are two sides to the problem:
1. Detecting function-wide synchronized(this) and marking it on the method symbol - should be done early on, in a phase that manipulates trees
2. Avoiding the boxing and unboxing - scalac -optimize does the job properly:

{code}
public boolean f();
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	dup
   2:	astore_1
   3:	monitorenter
   4:	aload_0
   5:	monitorexit
   6:	iconst_0
   7:	ireturn
   8:	aload_1
   9:	monitorexit
   10:	athrow
{code}
This seems to cover it:
