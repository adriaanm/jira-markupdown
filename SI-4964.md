AFAIK, there may only be one package object for a given package in Scala.

As of 2.9.1 both SBT (0.7.7) and Scala IDE Eclipse (recent nightly build) allow multiple package objects to be declared for the same package, when the 2 declarations are in different but associated projects (eg a project B depends upon project A). In both cases, one of the package objects shadows the other.

IME, in ScalaIDE, code in project B see's projects B's version of the package object, while in SBT, code in project B sees project A's version of the package object.

Not sure where best to assign this to - whether its a compiler issue or just a tool-specific problem. Please advise.
Compiler's job is to disallow simultaneous compilation of two of the same package object.  Far as I can see it does that, so the bug should be reported elsewhere.
```scala
b.scala:2: error: package is already defined as object bar
  package object bar {
                 ^
one error found
```
