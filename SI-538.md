scalac does not invalidate class files older than corresponding source files (it seems to simply recompile source files that are explicitly specified on the command-line). For comparison, javac does the right thing; from the javac man page:

```scala
       A successful type search may produce a class file, a  source  file,  or
       both. Here is how javac handles each situation:


          o Search  produces  a  class file but no source file: javac uses the
            class file.

          o Search produces a source file but no class  file:  javac  compiles
            the source file and uses the resulting class file.

          o Search  produces both a source file and a class file: javac deter‚Äê
            mines whether the class file is out of date. If the class file  is
            out of date, javac recompiles the source file and uses the updated
            class file. Otherwise, javac just uses the class file.

          javac considers a class file out of date only if it  is  older  than
          the source file.
```
