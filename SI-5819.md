```
assert(consumed == consumedTypes.size, 
       "Someone forgot to override consumedTypes() in " +  this)
```

Also merge in Paul's ICode cleanup: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6e943125b3
Additionally,

```
// TODO Logical's 2nd elem should be declared ValueTypeKind, to better approximate its allowed values (isIntSized, its comments appears to convey)
// TODO GenICode uses `toTypeKind` to define that elem, `toValueTypeKind` would be needed instead.
// TODO How about adding some asserts to Logical and similar ones to capture the remaining constraint (UNIT not allowed).
```
In `CZJUMP(success, failure, cond, kind)`, whenever `kind.isRefOrArrayType` , `cond` can't be one of `GT, GE, LT, LE`.
