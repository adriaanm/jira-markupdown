This might fall under the same rubric: var varargs.  Given (var is: Int*), you can assign one Int, is=1, but not is=List(1,2,3).  Also, someone wanted an implicit convert(Seq) to apply to a vararg, which is expected if vararg is type Seq inside the method.  With respect to overloading (how to explain how it works), it was suggested the spec should talk about A* with the same reverence applied to =>A. (That is, a useful fiction.)
