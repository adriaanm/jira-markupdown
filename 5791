You have another jline on your classpath.

  "Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: jline.UnixTerminal cannot be cast to scala.tools.jline.Terminal"

We don't ship a jline.UnixTerminal, or jline.anything.
```scala
% for j in /scala/inst/292/lib/* ; do jar tf $j |grep ^jline; done
%
```
Your other jline is overwriting the terminal selection system property.
