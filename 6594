We need a determination on what's supposed to happen when there is a type alias with a name which would be an object's companion class if it had one.  Right now there are a bunch of ways for it to fail, because none of the code which hops between related classes was written to take this into account.  It is made yet buggier by the fact that the type alias and object have different owners (the package object class and the package class.)
