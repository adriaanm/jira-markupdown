When a package scoped java class is in the inheritance hierarchy of a scala class, call to super method from scala results in compiler error "Unable to access method aMethod in class AJava with a super reference"

It is easily reproducible using this code:

{code:title=AJava.java|borderStyle=solid}
package test.java;

abstract class AJava {
    protected void aMethod() {
    }
}
```scala

{code:title=BJava.java|borderStyle=solid}
package test.java;

public class BJava extends AJava {
}
```

{code:title=CScala.scala|borderStyle=solid}
package test.scala

import test.java.BJava

class CScala extends BJava {

  protected override def aMethod() {
    super.aMethod()
  }

}
{code}

This is something which works in pure Java, and it also works for pure scala, but not for java/scala mixed code.
It works in java because you put them in the same package, which is kind of a big advantage when we're talking about package-level access. Try putting BJava in any package other than test.java, as you did with CScala by putting it in package test.scala, and you will see the same behavior.
