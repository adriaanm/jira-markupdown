This is essentially a duplicate of scala/bug#1209 and at least one other ticket I can't find right now.  If you want your implicits to work everywhere, declare the return type.
```scala
  implicit def string2FooString(s: String): FooString = new FooString(s)
```
That works.
```scala
  //println(string2FooString("%s = %s") % ("foo", "bar")); // this line causes next line to compile!
```
That works because calling it explicitly causes the return type to be resolved.
```scala
// if this module is moved to the top of the file, the code compiles
```
That works because then the implicit's return type is resolved before it gets to the operation which needs it.
