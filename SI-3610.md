Possibly same as https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/3609
```scala
object Test extends Application {
  class A
  class B extends A
  def foo(x: A, y: B) = print(1)
  object foo {
    def apply(x: B, y: B) = print(3)
    //def apply(x: A, y: A) = print(5)
  }

  foo(new B, new B)
}
```
This code is ok. There is no bug. It prints 3.
But if we uncomment second apply then it doesn't compile. What is strange, because we have most specific method.
indeed, most likely duplicate of #3610
duplicate of #3609 of course...
