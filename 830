The problem is with namers, and even wrapping the case object and companion class shouldn't help (someone can verify? I don't have enough experience running the interpreter). The problem is that given the way that case classes add the apply/unapply method to its companion object prevents separate compilation of the two: they have to always be recompiled together. I think the interpreter assumes separate compilation is possible, right? I'd like to get Lex's opinion on this before I can figure out if there is a quick fix for this or not.
