Using version 2.7.1.r15804-b20080816212059.

```scala
object T5 extends Application {
  val i : Int = null.asInstanceOf[Int]
  println(i)
}
```

Expected: a NullPointerException, as specified in section 6.3 of the spec (as of 2008-05-05), since Int doesn't conform to AnyRef.

Got: output "0".
See #602 and the related #668 for details as to why this is there. 
#4437 seems to be the main focus of activity and handles the whole variety of the problems with asInstanceOf, so I guess this could be closed as a duplicate of #4437 before it is forgotten completely?
