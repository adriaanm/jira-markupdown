Put the following into Eclipse
```scala
class Foo {
  var x: Iterable[Int] = _
}
```
and hover over Iterable. You will see:

(I) scala.collection.Iterable
$$iterableInfo

It should expand the $$iterableInfo variable.

The same holds in the following self contained example.
```scala
class Foo {
	var x: Bar = _
}

/** $$bazinfo
 */  
class Bar extends Baz {

}

/** $$bazinfo
 *  define bazinfo Info of Baz
 */
class Baz {
}
```
hover over the Bar in Foo and you'll see $$bazinfo. You should see
"Info of Baz" instead.
