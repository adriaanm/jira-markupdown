By extension, is this a useful way to say {{T}} has no instances?
{code}
trait T { final def f: Unit }
{code}

There is a balance to be struck between "that's stupid, you're not expressing something useful" and "OK, maybe there's a use case for that."

Also, should the compiler say "that's stupid", or is that the job of the REPL or Abide?

What about
{code}
trait F { def f: Unit }
package impl { trait T extends F { override final def f: Unit } }
{code}

where the API requires {{T}} but which will never be supplied in fact? I guess that's a badly designed API.
