By extension, is this a useful way to say `T` has no instances?
```scala
trait T { final def f: Unit }
```

There is a balance to be struck between "that's stupid, you're not expressing something useful" and "OK, maybe there's a use case for that."

Also, should the compiler say "that's stupid", or is that the job of the REPL or Abide?

What about
```scala
trait F { def f: Unit }
package impl { trait T extends F { override final def f: Unit } }
```

where the API requires `T` but which will never be supplied in fact? I guess that's a badly designed API.
