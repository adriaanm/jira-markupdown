Considerably reduced.  The difference between g0 and g1 below is only whether the implicit conversion is called explicitly.
{code}
object Bar {
  implicit def convert[T](xs: Seq[T]) = new Bippy(xs)
  class Bippy[T](xs: Seq[T]) { def bippy = xs }

  def g0 = identity(Seq().bippy)
  def g1 = identity(convert(Seq()).bippy)
  // def g0: Seq[T] = ...
  // def g1: Seq[Nothing] = ...
}
{code}
