This might be a different bug than scala/bug#2767. There are two ways to trigger this.

**The 1st way**
 1. Create a Scala project
 2. Create a Scala class _A_ in the default package
 3. Create the following class in the default package
```scala
class B {
  val a = new A
}
```
 4. Do a Clean&Build

After step 4 we get a bogus error in the editor saying: "A does not have a constructor".
