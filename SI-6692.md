{{EXISTENTIAL}} flag is [declared|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.9.x/src/library/scala/reflect/generic/Flags.scala#L70] as following constant (in 2.9.x branch):
{code}
final val EXISTENTIAL   = 0x800000000L  // type is an existential parameter or skolem
{code}

The {{PickledFlags}} [defined|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.9.x/src/library/scala/reflect/generic/Flags.scala#L103] in the same file determines which flags get pickled:
{code}
final val PickledFlags: Long  = 0xFFFFFFFFL
{code}

Simple REPL experiment (instead of counting number of zeros...) shows that {{EXISTENTIAL}} flag does not get pickled:
{code}
scala> final val EXISTENTIAL   = 0x800000000L
EXISTENTIAL: Long(34359738368L) = 34359738368

scala> final val PickledFlags: Long  = 0xFFFFFFFFL
PickledFlags: Long = 4294967295

scala> EXISTENTIAL & PickledFlags
res0: Long = 0
{code}

This results in symbols for existential types being entered as decls when [unpickling|:https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.9.x/src/library/scala/reflect/generic/UnPickler.scala#L297]:
{code}
if (sym.owner.isClass && sym != classRoot && sym != moduleRoot &&
            !sym.isModuleClass && !sym.isRefinementClass && !sym.isTypeParameter && !sym.isExistentiallyBound)
          symScope(sym.owner) enter sym
{code}

due to {{!sym.isExistentiallyBound}} returning wrong result (true). This has severe consequences for sbt's incremental compilation because sbt thinks that API has changed. See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/simple-build-tool/Anumu_erCVY/discussion for example.

    Existentially quantified symbols, when read by the unpickler, do not
    have the existential flag set. This leads to failure. This patch seeks
    improvement. Closes #4757, review by odersky.
