`EXISTENTIAL` flag is [declared](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.9.x/src/library/scala/reflect/generic/Flags.scala#L70) as following constant (in 2.9.x branch):
```scala
final val EXISTENTIAL   = 0x800000000L  // type is an existential parameter or skolem
```

The `PickledFlags` [defined](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.9.x/src/library/scala/reflect/generic/Flags.scala#L103) in the same file determines which flags get pickled:
```scala
final val PickledFlags: Long  = 0xFFFFFFFFL
```

Simple REPL experiment (instead of counting number of zeros...) shows that `EXISTENTIAL` flag does not get pickled:
```scala
scala> final val EXISTENTIAL   = 0x800000000L
EXISTENTIAL: Long(34359738368L) = 34359738368

scala> final val PickledFlags: Long  = 0xFFFFFFFFL
PickledFlags: Long = 4294967295

scala> EXISTENTIAL & PickledFlags
res0: Long = 0
```

This results in symbols for existential types being entered as decls when [unpickling](:https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.9.x/src/library/scala/reflect/generic/UnPickler.scala#L297):
```scala
if (sym.owner.isClass && sym != classRoot && sym != moduleRoot &&
            !sym.isModuleClass && !sym.isRefinementClass && !sym.isTypeParameter && !sym.isExistentiallyBound)
          symScope(sym.owner) enter sym
```

due to `!sym.isExistentiallyBound` returning wrong result (true). This has severe consequences for sbt's incremental compilation because sbt thinks that API has changed. See https://groups.google.com/d/topic/simple-build-tool/Anumu_erCVY/discussion for example.
See also this, which apparently missed the whole 2.9 series despite predating it:

    Existentially quantified symbols, when read by the unpickler, do not
    have the existential flag set. This leads to failure. This patch seeks
    improvement. Closes #4757, review by odersky.

and it came back out a year later (presumably after the set of pickled flags was expanded)
