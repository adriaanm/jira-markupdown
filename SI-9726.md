At line 91 in run/structural.scala , the test checks that the value of "r.p(0).hashCode()" is > 0. Object.hashcode() is not guaranteed to return a positive value. Oracle JVMs seems to always return a positive value, but this is implementation specific detail.  Further, I'm not entirely sure what the check is aimed to test. Even in the case where hashCode() only returns positive values, all that would prove is that "r.p(0)" successfully resolves to any object. 
I agree that looks fragile. I'd suggest replacing it with `.toString() == "ohone"`

I assume the test is making sure that the typechecker allows calls like:

```scala
def foo(x: { def y: Array[AnyRef] }): String = x.y(0).toString
```
