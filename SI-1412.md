When passed an string containing a JSON object:

```scala
{
            "username": "X1",
            "firstname": "X2",
            "lastname": "X3",
            "email": "X4",
            "isAdmin": false,
            "permissions": "X6"
}
```

parseFull returns an Option[List[Any]] (actually a List of pairs) instead of the Option[Map[String,Any]] that was promised.  I think I see the problem in the code.  When parseFull calls resolveType, resolveType seems to always return what it's given:
```scala
   def resolveType(input: List[Any]): Any = {  
     var objMap = Map[String, Any]()  
       
     if (input.forall {   
       case (key: String, value: List[_]) =>  
         objMap += (key -> resolveType(value))  
         true  
       case _ => false  
     }) objMap  
     else  
       input  
   }  
```
In particular, in the forall it seems to assume that all pairs are (String, List[_]) types.. but Strings, numbers etc.. aren't Lists.
This is a dup of #873 (fixed in r14979). It should be out in 2.7.2
