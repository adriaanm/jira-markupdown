OK, I disabled all forwarders in r17421 and reopened scala/bug#363 yet again.  At the moment I don't know how else to avoid scala/bug#1795, which looks like a sufficiently serious issue that forwarders should be sidelined until someone has a handle on the impact.  

I must say I didn't implement forwarders intending to take on this level of complexity -- I have other projects in the works which I understand a lot better and which I'm actually interested in.  All I personally wanted was for main() to work, but even that small ambition appears beyond me.
