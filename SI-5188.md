Create following files:

 * foo/Foo.scala
 * bar/Bar.scala

Run these command in shell:
{code}
cd foo
fsc Foo.scala
cd ../bar
fsc Bar.scala
{code}

Error:
{code}
error: source file 'Bar.scala' could not be found
{code}
There is no clear indication of what {{Foo.scala}} actually is, if it's in a package {{foo}} and if it somehow imports or otherwise references something in {{Bar.scala}}. This ticket would benefit from some more contextual information.
