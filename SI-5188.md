Create following files:

 * foo/Foo.scala
 * bar/Bar.scala

Run these command in shell:
```scala
cd foo
fsc Foo.scala
cd ../bar
fsc Bar.scala
```

Error:
```scala
error: source file 'Bar.scala' could not be found
```
There is no clear indication of what `Foo.scala` actually is, if it's in a package `foo` and if it somehow imports or otherwise references something in `Bar.scala`. This ticket would benefit from some more contextual information.
