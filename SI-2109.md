scalac doesn't accept Windows notepad or wordpad files saved as
"UTF-8" or "Unicode", even when the -encoding UTF-8 option is
used.  When the same file is saved with jEdit as UTF-8, there 
is no problem.  But notepad and wordpad are probably installed on
more computers than any other editor in the world, and this
could be a nuisance for people just trying out Scala.  This
is probably one of the dreaded BOM issues...
Here is another attempt to challange this issue: [commit|https://github.com/aborg0/scala-1/commit/83f358bcf0e4e035540caad7feb09be89ca61a2a] (this time it is quite recent, so if it is suitable I guess it can be merged, passes all the tests). I think the important parts are mentioned in the commit message, although it worth noting, that UTF-7 is not supported.
