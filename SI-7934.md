Sometimes I'm forced to use a deprecated method.  I need to filter these case by case, so that the warnings remain useful generally.  I do appreciate these warnings and act on them when I can, but if my build output becomes overrun with warnings I can do nothing about, I will eventually just ignore them all.

I've open this but to clarify #1781
One thing you can exploit is that deprecation warnings are not issued within deprecated methods/classes. So you can coral your usages of deprecated APIs behind a facade:

```scala
scala> @deprecated("", "") def foo = 0
foo: Int

scala> object Test { @deprecated("", "") class Coral { def fooForwarder = foo }; object Coral extends Coral }
defined object Test

scala> Test.Coral.fooForwarder
res1: Int = 0
```
As has been pointed out, the workaround depends on behavior that I at least would consider a bug, and may be fixed at a later time. And without finer control it means that for code that has to use deprecated API's I can either use -Xfatal-warnings or -deprecation, but not both.

+1 reopening.
Also pull request 4544 hasn't been merged in yet, and the silencer plugin only allows you to silence **all** warnings, not just deprecation warnings.
+1 Jason's trick is indeed clever; however, it is rather cumbersome for corralling calls to deprecated interface, class or constructor methods from a third-party library because one has to write different Scala code to call such deprecated methods so that we can compile with `-deprecation` and `-Xfatal-warnings`
That isn't consistent with what I'm experiencing, even the first line gives a deprecation error:

Your comment is neither helpful nor pleasant. This isn't a shell/REPL issue, this is a Scala issue (unless you're implying that SBT isn't representative)?

If you want to see this in action, the [Accord](https://github.com/wix/accord/tree/scala2.10-cleanup) codebase has a branch that cross-compiles between 2.10.3 and 2.11.1 that showcases this issue.
