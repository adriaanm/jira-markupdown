I canâ€™t find Any and AnyRef in the current scaladoc http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#package, while they used to be there in Scala 2.10.3 http://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.10.3/index.html#scala.AnyRef

[~gourlaysama] This was the ticket I meant to comment in, that I thought might be amenable to some of your detective work!
