In total, the solution(s) to scala/bug#4176 leave us in a situation where we can write:
```scala
object Repeater extends ((Int*) => Unit) {
  def apply(x: Int*) {}
}
```

but not do much more with it; it is treated as a subtype of `Seq\[Int\] => Unit`

More discussion over at scala/bug#6016.

It might be prudent to disallow `*` in non method types altogether.

`=>A` hasn't suffered the same scrutiny. It remains expressible in function types (and it's pretty commonly used as such):
```scala
scala> def f(a: (=> Any) => Any) = a(???)
f: (a: => Any => Any)Any

scala> f(x => 0)
res1: Any = 0
```


Eta expansion retains the by-name-ness:
```scala
scala> def foo(z: Any)(a: => Int) = z
foo: (z: Any)(a: => Int)Any

scala> (foo(0) _)(???)
res2: Any = 0
```

So I'm not sure where to take this. If we're going to follow through with the tough stance on `*`, we should do it completely. But we should also have a clear story about why we have different rules for `=>`.
