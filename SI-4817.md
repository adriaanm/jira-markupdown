def replicate(x:Char, n:Int) = {
    def rep(m:Int, l:List[Char]): List[Char] =
      if (m <= 0) l else rep(m - 1, x :: l)

    rep(n, Nil)  
  }

  val replicateSpec = forAll { (x:Char, n:Int) =>  just change the value 

I can reproduce it in 2.9.2, but I cannot reproduce it in Scala version 2.10.0-20120511-110655-3511e5960d (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_03) with:

{code}
class Foo(@beans.BeanProperty var bar:String) {
  def setBar(d:Double) {
    bar = d.toString
  }
}
{code}

I remember that there was a fix a few weeks ago, but I'm probably not looking for the right terms with git log --grep.
Maybe a candidate for 2.9.3? (I'll tag it with backport, so it might at least be considered...)
