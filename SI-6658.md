The order of named parameters passed affects behavior in an unexpected way. 

class Family(val mom: String, val dad: String, val kids:String*)
// this works
val f1 = new Family(mom="Mom", dad="Dad")
// this does not
val f2 = new Family(dad="Dad", mom="Mom")

In summary, parameters passed in same order as class definition work fine. Parameters passed in a different order fail with complaint:

error: when using named arguments, the vararg parameter has to be specified exactly once

Only causes problem when also declaring a variable argument list.

right.. the point is that in the first case the named arguments are in the parameter order, so they are simply discarded early on, so technically the invocation is not actually triggering the named arguments transformation in the typer. that's why it passes.

maybe the spec should mention that - "named arguments are transformed int positional ones if all of them are on the corresponding parameter positions"

another instance of the same is the following - in principle it's not allowed to have a positional argument after a named one, but:

{code}
scala> def foo(a: Int, b: Int) = 0
foo: (a: Int, b: Int)Int

scala> foo(1, b = 2)
res0: Int = 0

scala> foo(b = 2, 1)
<console>:9: error: positional after named argument.
              foo(b = 2, 1)
                         ^
{code}
Yes, it has sounded to me throughout like the semantic gap is that on the specifying side, "named arguments" is used to mean only those cases where the names are necessary, not simply where they are provided. If you could remove the names and it would still work, that's not what it means by "named arguments." On the hearing side, people think "named arguments" means any time the names are written down.

That's all in the realm of specification lawyering, and is separate from what should be the relevant question of whether the behavior represents the optimal tradeoff.
