Scala supports pattern matching against XML nodes in only a very rudimentary way.  The lack of any support for namespaces may be the most glaring omission.  

http://www.nabble.com/Namespace-support-in-XML-patterns-td17562546.html was a few years ago but had some fairly concrete suggestions, I'll write up a pre-pre-SIP "hopefully soon" to try to move things along.
Note that I'm specifically talking about matching patterns with idiomatic XML-like syntax, e.g.:
{code}
xml match {
  case <Elem/> => ...
  case <Elem attr="123">{ kids: _* }</Elem> => ...
}
{code}

Of course, you can always match against scala.xml.Elem constructors but that gets ugly fast.


It seems that we speak about two different problems in this ticket:

No. 1: Pattern matching is not able to accept element names plus attributes.
Test case:

{code}
val xml = <a anyAttr="0815">some text</a>
xml match {
  // Next statement will not compile. Remove attribute and it will
  // compile (2.7.7). Is the result correct (matching regardless of attribute)?  
  case <a anyAttr="0815">{content}</a>     => println("   match: " + content)
  case other                               => println("no match: " + other)
}
{code}
This is first a problem of the compiler and second a possible problem of undefined behaviour.

No.2: Namespace problems because of recognition only prefixes and not URI's (as discussed by Stefan Zeiger and others in the link to nabble.com).
