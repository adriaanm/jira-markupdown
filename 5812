Regarding the excessive usage of Any/AnyRef/AnyVal in signatures:

Maybe the kinds {{class}}, {{trait}} and {{object}} can be implicitly considered to be a subclass of {{AnyRef}} and the value types could get another word as a kind, like {{value}}?

Considering that the user can't really define any new AnyVal classes, how would he know that the "right" definition of value types is "final class" instead of e. g. "value/struct/data/bippy/..."?

The "final class" extending "AnyVal" behave very differently from every other "class" (No nullability, no Constructor, literals, etc. ...). 

I can hardly think of any person which would, when asked to characterize an Int, respond with "it's a "final class". It is just in no way an accurate description, so why should ScalaDoc keep claiming it?

I would tend to the opinion that a slighty more high-level view instead of showing the "implementation details" would be an improvement.
