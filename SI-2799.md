```scala
scala> [paulp@jon Desktop]$$ scala -deprecation

scala> @deprecated("hi mom") case class Bob ()
<console>:4: warning: class Bob in object $$iw is deprecated: hi mom
       @deprecated("hi mom") case class Bob ()
                                        ^
```
I guess the reason is the factory method in the companion object:

```scala
final <synthetic> object Bob extends java.lang.Object with () => $$iw.$$iw.Bob with ScalaObject {
[...]
  case <synthetic> def apply(): $$iw.$$iw.Bob = new $$iw.this.Bob()
[...]
}
```

The solution is probably to mark the companion object deprecated as well.
(In r22694) close #2799. companion objects of deprecated classes are also marked as deprecated. review by extempore.
