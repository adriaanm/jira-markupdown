The entire mechanism around SELECTOR_DUMMY, synthetic UnApply nodes, the typing of extractors, etc. is way unnecessarily complicated and I beg that you not layer more complication on top of it.  If you just try to document the precise life cycle of an UnApply I predict great simplification (which also addresses your immediate problems) will emerge naturally.
