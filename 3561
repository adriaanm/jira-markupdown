I don't see a -Xss value there, which means that you're using the default for your JVM. That's almost certainly borderline for the Scala IDE (which explains why you see the problem intermittently) and quite possibly for any Eclipse application.

The recommended heap configuration can be found [http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94 here]. If you don't have sufficient physical memory to follow that to the letter, allocate as much as you're able, and in particular specify -Xss1M.
