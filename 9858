That might be enough for `TraversableOnce`, but not for `Traversable`. One should be able to write:
```scala
scala> val it = List(1, 2).iterator
it: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> val ts = it.toTraversable
ts: Traversable[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> ts.foreach(println)
1
2

scala> ts.foreach(println)
1
2
```

For future reference: it's best to start these discussions on [scala-language] before lodging a bug.
