Trac consistently logs me out of my session.
The interval seems very, very short - a minute or two, often
less time than it takes to read or update an entry, or change
ticket search filters.

For example, I was logged out in the time it took me to enter this ticket and submit it. Worse, Trac does not allow using the browser Back button; it loses the text entry content, so I had to retype everything. Same happens editing a wiki page.

I access this trac throuh my company's proxy server.
My browser is Mozilla 3 

Note: I have seen this exact same problem on other Trac sites (such as the Project Fortress Trac; see https://projectfortress.sun.com/Projects/Community)
Thank you! This appears to be working as expected. Trac actually works now!
