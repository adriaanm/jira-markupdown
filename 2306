In retrospect, I would argue we should not have those problematic owner chains at all.

SBT's incremental compilation scheme is foiled by the shape of owner chains depending on whether a symbol's info was pickled and then unpickled or if it was obtained directly by type checking source code. We can make SBT insensitive to these changes in the case of refinements, but as a general principle, it should hold that `unpickle(pickle(typecheck) == typecheck`. See scala/bug#6596.
