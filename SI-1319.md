The equals method of case classes uses "instanceof" and is therefor not symmetric. This means that a.equals(b) doesn't imply b.equals(a), such as in this example:

scala> case class A{}
defined class A

scala> case class B extends A{}
defined class B

scala> val a = A()
a: A = A()

scala> val b = B()
b: B = B()

scala> a == b
res0: Boolean = true

scala> b == a
res1: Boolean = false

I just started learning Scala. But, I know a whole lot of programming and have been addicted to Java for quite some time.

Basically, I believe `getClass()` should always be preferred over `instanceof`. Symmetry being one. The other is that there really is no rational use case for `instanceof` (*allowing an instance of the subclass to be equal to an instance of the superclass*). In 99 % of all use cases, if we add a subclass into our type system, then the subclass will add state. <ins>Perhaps</ins> not more state then the type itself. But, <ins>type is state</ins>. Simply put it: A dog is not a duck even if it is well behaved enough to walk and sound like one. I argue that any OO-language should always strive to mimic the real world as closely as possible.

I understand the complexity of the nature, but it saddens me a bit to see that this issue has been marked resolved. We should put a lot of effort into making the best out of Scala.
