Trying to copy-paste just about anything in scaladoc is an exercise in massive frustration because the entire thing is an active link.  If I'm looking at something like this:
{code}
case class Tuple9 [+T1, +T2, +T3, +T4, +T5, +T6, +T7, +T8, +T9] (_1: T1, _2: T2, _3: T3, _4: T4, _5: T5, _6: T6, _7: T7, _8: T8, _9: T9) extends Product9[T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9] with Product with Serializable
{code}
I really don't need every single character of that to link (including, to the great negative utility of the link, such things as "case" and "Serializable") to the product definition.  One should not have to "sneak up" on the text in order to select it.

I am working hard not to mark many of these scaladoc tickets high priority, but the usability issues here are numerous and serious and if I thought it would make a difference, they would be so marked.
