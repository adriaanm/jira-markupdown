```scala
scala> 2
res0: Int = 2

scala> { 2; 3 }
res1: Int = 3
```

so far so good, but then (in 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 alike):

```scala
scala> 2; 3

scala> val a = 2; 3
a: Int = 2
```

Hey REPL, where'd my 3's go?

(floated on scala-user at http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/39614, no replies)
(extempore in [r25032](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25032)) Overcoming limitations of the repl, multiple-tree lines and assignments.

The best part of nicely documented limitations is that you can stare at the
same comment for years and then the day comes when you give it the heave-ho.

Exhibit A (regarding a single bare expression): "This is necessary due to it
being hard to modify code at a textual level, and it being hard to submit an
AST to the compiler." Yes, it IS hard to modify code at a textual level (see
enclosed patch) but we won't let that stop us anymore.  Closes #4578.

Exhibit B (regarding the left hand side of assignments having to be Ident):
"An unfortunate limitation." Unfortunate no longer! No review.
