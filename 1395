The rationale for the ticket is that both asInstanceOf and isInstanceOf in the example are compiled to code that does not behave as non-erased code would. Specifically, the shown asInstanceOf performs a conversion that will not, due to erasure, issue a ClassCastException at the conversion point (as all other casts), but will rather perform a "silent" conversion which will result in type-unsafe operations at a later, non-obvious point in the code. Surely that warrants at least a warning.
