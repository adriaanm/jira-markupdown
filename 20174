Projects with only a single package object file (and nothing else) generate empty scaladoc. For example:

project dir content:
{code:text}
- build.sbt
- src/main/scala/a/b/c/package.scala
{code}

package.scala content:
{code:scala}
package a.b.c.d

/**
  * package description
  */
object `package` {
  /**
    * function description.
    */
  def function: Unit = ???
}
{code}

The scaladoc generation is done with sbt. Some files are created like index.html, and image files in the lib folder. However, when viewing index.html in a browser, the package {{a.b.c.d}} is not listed. Adding classes to package {{a.b.c.d}} triggers the package documentation generation.

Tested with scala 2.10. Haven't tried with 2.11 yet.
