A common use case is to assign a button and a textfield the same action, so the user can trigger the action via clicking the button *or* pressing the return key. Example:

```scala
val actSearch = Action("Search") { ... }

btnSearch.action = actSearch
tfSearch.action = actSearch
```

=== Possible Workarounds: ===

 * Use `EditDone`: works, but is not very convenient for this use case and doesn't provide the proper level of abstraction. At last, we want to trigger an action.

 * Write a trait like:

```scala
trait ActionSupport extends UIElement {

	var action: Action = Action.NoAction

	// @todo avoid explicit case here - but how?
	peer.asInstanceOf[JTextField].addActionListener(ActionListener { ev => action() })
}

// usage:
val tf = new TextField with ActionSupport
```

This works for me, but I think it should be there in the library already.

So, could you please provide "action" support for `TextField`. The implementation should be painless.

And, BTW could you please give some hint on how to use `Action.Trigger[.Wrapper]` in the documentation. I couldn't figure out... ;)

Thank you! Great library anyway! :)
