As of Scala 2.9.1.RC2, each swing.Component installs a MouseMotionListener, whether it is needed or not. This leads to a huge amount of events generated just by moving the mouse over some Components. The same mechanism is used in scala.swing for other types of events (like key events or mouse clicks), but they're not as critical, because they don't get generated in such large amounts. As you probably know, the AWT designers deliberately separated MouseEvents from MouseMotionEvents for exactly this reason. As of today's hardware and VMs, the performance penalty is not that big anymore, but I think we shouldn't waste resources unnecessarily.

I see two possible fixes:

(a) Just define Component#mouse.moves as lazy val.

(b) If you prefer a more elaborate solution, call peer.addMouseListener when the first reactor subscribes to mouse.moves and call peer.removeMouseListener when the last reactor unsubscribes from it.


In the context of this issue, I would prefer (a) because of its conciseness. Just adding a thought concerning (b) and the removal of AWT listeners though: in my experience, it is important to always remove javax.swing listeners when they're no longer needed, because not doing so can lead to large amounts of garbage being held in memory just because of a single listener reference - which may be hard to find. This applies for Java 1.4, I'm not sure about newer releases. As I see, you are using weak references for the publisher/reactor mechanism, but as far as I can tell, this doesn't include the javax.swing listeners - which might a source for bad "memory leaks". Maybe you can consider this in a future scala.react package, which BTW I'm very eager to see being released... :-)
