{code}
scala> if (false) Array("qwe") else Array()
java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.String;
{code}

Expected: either compilation error, or correct inference for the second array creation
Here is another situation which generates CCEs.  Array lubs can't be taken this way.
{code}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = List(Array(0), Array(0L)).map(x => x)
}
// java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Object;
{code}

This may be the same as SI-4216.
After fiddling with this for far too long, all I can say is we need to completely reevaluate this aspect of the compiler.  It should not be this hard to avoid generating CCEs.  I think we throw away too much information, and should be able to access the actual types of arrays during genjvm with no uncertainty.

Since {{ArrayTags}} have landed:

{code}
scala> Array()
<console>:8: error: macro has not been expanded
              Array()
                   ^

scala> :type if (false) Array("qwe") else Array()
<console>:8: error: macro has not been expanded
       if (false) Array("qwe") else Array()
                                         ^
<console>:8: error: macro has not been expanded
              if (false) Array("qwe") else Array()
{code}

The error message isn't stellar, but it beats a runtime error.
This behaves well with {{2.10.0-20120619-072829-f1684e9edf}}
{code}
scala> List(Array(0), Array(0L)).map(x => x)bad option: '-nc'

With 2.10.0-M3 I saw:

Well, that failure has a whole nothing to do with this ticket.

I made it SI-6108.
Looks like the underlying problem isn't solved, it's just masked by SI-5923. As soon as the latter was fixed (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2464), the troubles manifested themselves again.

{code}
scala> lub(List(typeOf[Array[String]], typeOf[Array[Nothing]]))
res2: reflect.runtime.universe.Type = Array[_ <: String]
{code}

I wonder how to reconcile this behavior of `lub` with the fact that arrays of Nothing are represented as arrays of Objects at runtime.

Here is the issue with Array lubs:

For a type CC[T] where T is invariant, the lub of CC[A] and CC[B] should be

  CC[T] forSome { type T >: glb(A, B) <: lub(A, B) }.

But if A=Nothing, that is simplified to

  CC[T] forSome { type T <: B }

You can usually get away with this. Take Set for instance. If you make a
list with a Set[Nothing] and a Set[Int] in it, it will appear as a Set[_ <: Int].
Since you can't get any values out of a Set[Nothing], nor put
any into it, erasure protects you from the lie being revealed. There is
nothing but a "Set" there under the hood.

With Arrays, there is storage and the storage has a type which is
stronger than "Array". That means if you discard any information when
taking the lub, you risk failing at runtime. The lub of Array[Nothing]
and Array[Int] has to be

  Array[T] forSome { type T <: Int with Nothing }

In other words it cannot simplify "Int with Nothing" to "Int" as it
does at present. It is not safe to replace "A with B" with "A" in an
existential bound, even when B is a subtype of A.

Still broken:
