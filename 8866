I am closing this. The original issue I reported is fixed. It's now perfectly safe to use the optimizer with, at least, medium-sized Map literals, the sort one might normally use in normal code.

I was able to get the new optimizer to produce the following warning, but only by cranking the size of the map up really high (thousands):

{code}
[warn] scala/Predef$ArrowAssoc$::$minus$greater$extension(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/Tuple2; is annotated @inline but could not be inlined:
[warn] The size of the callsite method O$::<init>()V
[warn] would exceed the JVM method size limit after inlining scala/Predef$ArrowAssoc$::$minus$greater$extension(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/Tuple2;.
{code}
