I assume you mean transient, not volatile. The confusion was probably caused by looking at my attempted fix for scala/bug#7838 (where I made the same mistake) just before commenting on this ticket.

Reversing the meaning of the bits might work. Field initializers are not run before deserialization. You could use a field initializer to set the bits upon proper construction of the object and end up with unset bits after deserialization.
