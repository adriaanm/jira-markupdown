```scala
scala> trait HasType{ var `type`: String }
defined trait HasType
```

**Would be nice if that compiled:**
```scala
scala> new HasType{ var Some(`type`) = Some("foo") }
<console>:10: error: stable identifier required, but $anon.this.`type` found.
              new HasType{ var Some(`type`) = Some("foo") }
                                    ^
```

**Workaround:**
```scala
scala> new HasType{ var Some(t) = Some("foo"); var `type`= t }
res7: HasType{def t: String; def t_=(x$1: String): Unit} = $anon$1@38c60a18
```

I am programmatically generating Scala code, so the workaround means a corner case in the code generator.
It might be possible to extend the grammar to allow this in pattern binders:

I think we could change:

```
Pattern2 ::= varid ‘@’ Pattern3
```

to:

```
Pattern2 ::= id ‘@’ Pattern3
```

Which would admit both of:

```scala
scala> val Some(Tpe @ _) = Some(1)
<console>:1: error: ')' expected but '@' found.
       val Some(Tpe @ _) = Some(1)
                    ^

scala> val Some(`type` @ _) = Some(1)
<console>:1: error: ')' expected but '@' found.
       val Some(`type` @ _) = Some(1)
                       ^
```

Perhaps you can think over this proposal critically. If you can make a case that it doesn't introduce ambiguity, lets discuss at the Scala meeting.
This is the narrower change of allowing backquoted idents that still look like varids.
