Sometime between r23057 (which can compile the following) and r23112 (which cannot) a pickler bug was introduced.  I reduced it to the following.
{code}
import scala.tools.nsc._

class SemanticTokens(val compiler: Global) {   
  import compiler._  

  def build() = ErrorType
  
  class Process {
    def f() = analyzer
    // or to crash the compiler instead of a nice message,
    // def f() = analyzer underlying _
  }
}
{code}
{code}
% /scala/inst/pack-r23112/bin/scalac -d /tmp test/pickler-bug.scala
error: class file needed by TypeDiagnostics is missing.
reference value ErrorType of scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types refers to nonexisting symbol.
one error found
{code}
Reverted, so closing (I will handle it locally as part of proper fix for SI-1591).
