co-evolution == creation?

finally answered one of those cringe-inducing questions-to-self 
{code}
    override def coevolveSym(pre1: Type): Symbol =
      if (pre eq pre1) sym else (pre, pre1) match {
        // don't look at parents -- it would be an error to override alias types anyway
        case (RefinedType(_, _), RefinedType(_, decls1)) => decls1 lookup sym.name
        // TODO: is there another way a typeref's symbol can refer to a symbol defined in its pre?
        // yup: they could both be `SingleType`s with an underlying RefinedType
        case (preOrig, preNew) if preOrig.isStable && preNew.isStable => preNew.decls lookup sym.name 
{code}
