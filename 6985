This looks rather difficult to fix with the way forwarders are currently done. I think the better solution would be to generate static forwarders earlier in the pipeline and have them transformed normally. Probably the right way to go about this is to implement the {{@static}} pre-SIP: https://github.com/scala/scala.github.com/pull/491.
