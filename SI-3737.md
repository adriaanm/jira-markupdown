`Option`'s scaladoc is wrong in a few places (`map` and `flatMap`) and the overall style and consistency of it could be improved.  Further, some examples of using it would be helpful in making clear what the idiomatic usage is.

Attached is a patch that addresses this; only doc comments were changes.
(In r22713) update doc of option. close SI-3737.
