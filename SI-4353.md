We have following (java classes):

{code}
public class A {
    public static final String VALUE = "TEST";
}

public class B extends A {
}

{code} 

Now in Java following code would work:

{code}
    System.out.println(B.VALUE);
{code}

This is not the case with Scala though - we need to refer the constant via class A (e.g. A.VALUE).
=== What is the expected behavior? ===





=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
class A {
    public static final String VALUE = "TEST";
}

class B extends A {
}
{code} 

now following line in Java works:
{code}
    System.out.println(B.VALUE);
{code}

In Scala though following code:

{code}
    println(B.VALUE)
{code}

is incorrect.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Scala code should behave exactly like Java one (principle of least surprise - I believe this is consistent with would everyone would expect).

=== What do you see instead? ===

Compiler error - compiler cannot find the field specified. The only way to make it work is to invoke it via A.VALUE. 

=== Additional information ===


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6
  - Operating system: Windows 7
it's very much by design that it works this way.

this should have been a mailing list thread, not a ticket.
