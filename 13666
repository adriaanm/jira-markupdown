Trying to copy a .scala source file by drag & drop in Package Explorer leads to the following error message:

{code}
An unexpected exception occured. See the error log for more details.

Compilation unit name must end with .java, or one of the registered Java-like extensions
{code}

I'm using r15794 of the Eclipse plugin. Copying Scala files worked fine before the JDT integration (albeit without any refactoring)
