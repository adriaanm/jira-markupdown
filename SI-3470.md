Actor cannot be restarted anymore (after finish, exit, kill, crash, ...)
since at least 2.8.0.RC2. This used to work with 2.7.7 and
2.8.0.Beta1.

I think this is a critical regression, since it makes actor supervision
and restart pretty much impossible.


Demo (works in REPL or script mode):

```scala
import scala.actors._

val a = new Actor { var c = 0; def act() = { c += 1; println("A: started: " + c) } }
a.start()
Thread.sleep(1000)
a.start()
Thread.sleep(1000)
a.start()
```

Output with 2.7.7.final and 2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease:

```scala
A: started: 1
A: started: 2
A: started: 3
```

Output with 2.8.0.RC2 and 2.8.0.r22016 (current snapshot):
```scala
A: started: 1
```

It took place between beta1 and rc1.  Unfortunately that is a 3700 line diff for src/actors alone, so that's my whole contribution.
```scala
git diff remotes/tags/R_2_8_0_Beta1_prerelease..remotes/tags/R_2_8_0_RC1 -- src/actors/ |wc

```
It happened in r21106:

```scala
trait Actor ... {
  ...
  override def start(): Actor = synchronized {
	...
```

was changed to 

```scala
trait Actor ... {
  ...
  override def start(): Actor = synchronized {
    if (_state == Actor.State.New) {
	...
```

and similar changes happened in Reactor.

It's a huge commit. These particular change were done in the process of making `start()`
idempotent, which is a good thing, of course. Still, actors should be restartable,
so start should support the case `_state == Actor.State.Terminated`,
too.

Question is, should the mesage queue be cleared on restart? How do Akka
and Lift actors handle this on restart?
I don't see how `start` can be idempotent and support restarting a terminated actor at the same time. Restarting a terminated actor could be made the only exception to an otherwise idempotent `start`; however, I think that would make the semantics of `start` too complicated with little gain.

Also, the actor supervision and restart patterns known from Erlang are not affected by making `start` idempotent: "restarting" works by creating a new actor with the same behavior as the one that terminated. Note that Erlang actors cannot be restarted either.

In summary, making `start` idempotent was intentional. The goal has been to make the behavior of `start` robust (the behavior of `start` in 2.7.7 was a source of hard-to-debug errors, see http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/17995), and to simplify its semantics. Actually, the behavior of `start` in 2.7.x was never really specified; sure, you can test the implementation, but I do not consider the change to make `start` idempotent a regression. Therefore, I would suggest to close this ticket, unless there are compelling use cases that show that non-idempotent uses of `start` are very useful.

For your information, Jonas Bonï¿½r recommended to make `start` idempotent, see http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/18002/. Therefore, I assume that's also the case in Akka, but I haven't verified. Lift actors do not have execution states like started and terminated, they are always passively responsive to messages, but do not have "active" behavior.
I guess you're right, it's probably best if start stays fully idempotent, and does not restart a crashed Actor.

However (please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm no Erlang expert) I think restart capability is still important in the Scala case. In Erlang, of course, you would "throw away" a crashed process and a supervisor would start a new one, registered under the same name (did I get this right?). But there is no registering of (non-remote) actors in Scala, so how would other actors find the replacement for the crashed one?

Restarting under the same process-id would not fit Erlang well, since Erlang is more "pure", no reassignment of variables, etc. But with Scala, I think, restarting would make a lot of sense, since the Actor reference would stay valid, and we don't need a registering mechanism. Not centrally registering actors has a lot of advantages, it makes unused Actors available for GC for example, and the VM will determine for us if an Actor is still in use (i.e. referenced) or not.

So using the Actor's reference as the primary "key" to locate and access it should fit Scala very well. As far as Jonas (Akka's) Actors are concerned, they are certainly restartable (they even provide pre-/post-restart callbacks), from what I've seen. I guess the new ActorID's in Akka stay valid after a restart, too, but I haven't verified this.

Or did I get this wrong, is there already a way to locate a replacement actor in Scala? In that case, we can close this. If not, I'd plead for adding a simple `Actor.restart()`, maybe throwing an exception if the Actor is not in terminated state to make things safe.

I'll turn this from a regression into an urgent feature request, since my app currently hangs after an actor crashes. :-)
(In r22029) Addresses see #3470 by adding a method Reactor.restart. Review by rompf.
Thanks a lot, Philipp!

Uhm - I'm almost afraid to ask, 'cause I know you're all really busy - any chance this will make it into RC3? I'm getting greedy now, I know ... ;-)
