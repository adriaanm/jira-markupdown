Something is up with these; I swear some of them used to warn. Really, I can't spot "Nil == 0" ?
{noformat}
scala> val x = scala.collection.mutable.Map[String, List[String]]() withDefaultValue Nil
x: scala.collection.mutable.Map[String,List[String]] = Map()

scala> x("bippy") == 0
res0: Boolean = false

scala> 0 == x("bippy")
<console>:9: warning: comparing values of types Int and List[String] using `==' will always yield false
              0 == x("bippy")
                ^
res1: Boolean = false

scala> (null: List[String]) == 0
res2: Boolean = false

scala> Nil == 0
res3: Boolean = false
{noformat}

I just tripped on comparing a List to an Int.  I missed the nicety of a 'will always yield false' warning.  
{code}
$ ./scala 
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20130430-161342-13cf0481d2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_11).

scala> List("bah") == 1
res1: Boolean = false
{code}

(warns nicely if reversed)

{code}
scala> 1 == List("foo")
<console>:8: warning: comparing values of types Int and List[String] using `==' will always yield false
              1 == List("foo")
                ^
res0: Boolean = false
{code}

Realizing that it's hard to know for certain if someone has overridden equals, I suppose this is tricky.  Maybe an annotation on some library equals methods: @neverEqualsPrimitive.  Not clear to me how often this comes up or whether there's anything more reasonable to be done.

Welcome to Scala version 2.11.7 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_65).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def f(c: Char) = c == "o"
<console>:10: warning: comparing values of types Char and String using `==' will always yield false
       def f(c: Char) = c == "o"
                          ^
f: (c: Char)Boolean

scala> def f(s: String) = s.exists(_ == "o")
f: (s: String)Boolean

scala> def f(s: String) = s.exists((c: Char) => c == "o")
f: (s: String)Boolean
{code}
Here are more examples that don't warn, without using exists:

{{
scala> val f = (c: Char) => c == "ooo"
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f = 1 == (_:Char)
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f = "ooo" == (_:Char)
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f = (_:Char) == "ooo"
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f: Char => Boolean = _ == "ooo"
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>
}}

Maybe it's a matter of methods vs. functions?
