Running the program below should result in NPE, however under {{-optimize}} the {{println}} statement is executed.

{noformat}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val r: C = null;
    r.callee()
  }
}

final class C {
  @inline final def callee() { println("callee's body has run.") }
}
{noformat}

[~ureche], watch out for a similar situation when rewriting tail calls.


Two design alternatives:
# null-check and conditionally throwing NPE, takes 8 bytes in opcodes (snippet 1 below)
# factoring out that functionality into a newly added {{ScalaRunTime.nullCheck(arg)}}, takes 3 bytes.

I'm favoring the second alternative.

Just for the record, the snippets for each alternative:

{code:title=Addition_to_Inliners.scala|borderStyle=solid}
val NPEClass = definitions.NullPointerExceptionClass
val nwNPE    = NEW(REFERENCE(NPEClass))
val npeInit  = definitions.getMember(NPEClass, nme.CONSTRUCTOR).suchThat(_.paramss == List(Nil))
assert(npeInit != NoSymbol, "Couldn't find the no-args constructor of NullPointerException.")
val cmNPEInit = CALL_METHOD(npeInit, Static(true))
nwNPE.init    = cmNPEInit

val npeBlock = newBlock()
npeBlock.emit(nwNPE,                    instr.pos)
npeBlock.emit(DUP(REFERENCE(NPEClass)), instr.pos)
npeBlock.emit(cmNPEInit,                instr.pos)
npeBlock.emit(THROW(NPEClass),          instr.pos)
npeBlock.close()
{code}

{code:title=Addition_to_ScalaRunTime.scala|borderStyle=solid}
def nullCheck(x: AnyRef) {
  if (x == null) throw new NullPointerException
}
{code}


A variation on alternative 2 above: add {{nullCheck(Object)}} to {{src\library\scala\runtime\Statics.java}}
[~ijuma], that helps somewhat but performance still suffers unless the inliner gets smarter about which null-checks are redundant. The following shows that: https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/tree/SI-5850

The type-flow analysis should track non-nullness. I was planning to update the TFA anyway (to also track whether a type is exact, ie after new). Only then can this bug be closed.


Yes, increased code size is the problem. The heuristics built into scalac's inliner are very sensitive to them, preventing inlinings currently done. The non-redundant null-checks, once in place, will most likely be infrequent enough not to increase code size nearly as much. We'll know for sure after the SI-5849 and SI-5852 pending "improvements".
this would also resolve part of the problem reported in SI-6941 and SI-6508
