A combination of super access and parametric class will lead to malformed Scala signature/nonexisting symbol.

Recipe for the explosion:

{code}
[cunei@lampmac7 flaw]$$ cat D0.scala
 
package p

class X[T]

trait A {
  def m(s:X[_]) {}
}

trait B extends A {
  def f { super.m(null) }
}

[cunei@lampmac7 flaw]$$ cat D1.scala 

package p
class C extends B

[cunei@lampmac7 flaw]$$ ~/trunk/build/quick/bin/scalac D0.scala

problem is that in {{ def m(s:X[_]) {} }}, the symbol {{_}} gets pickled as "external", no loacal. the owner is {{method m}}, the unpickler tries to find a member named {{_$$1}} in {{mSym.info.decls}}.

It also happens when giving the existential a name, i.e. {{ def m(s:X[T forSome {type T}]) {} }}.

I think {{T / _$$1}} just has to be pickled as if they were local. => Ask martin what the current {{isUnrootedExistential}} logic in the pickler is for, and how to fix the current bug.
It looks like we arrived at approximately the same conclusion.  In r17719 I made a slight modification to isUnrootedExistential which fixes both SI-1896 and SI-715, but it remains to be seen how satisfactory that fix is.  I also would benefit from hearing the thinking behind the logic.  This bug is safely a duplicate of SI-715, so if the issue is to be reopened I vote for doing it there.

OK, I'll ask Martin what he thinks. btw, SI-1930 is probably another instance, can you check that?

thanks!

OK, Martin agrees that r17719 is the correct fix.

Very good, I hadn't seen that one.  Three tickets for the price of about 20 characters.
I think the issue might happen in cases even simpler than what's described, as in no parameter necessary.  That or I found a separate but related issue.

Given this trait def:

{code}
trait Instrumented {
  private lazy val errorer = ErrorReporterMgr.getMgr.getErrorReporter(super.getClass)
  private lazy val logger = LoggerMgr.getMgr.getLogger(super.getClass)
  private lazy val tracer = TracerMgr.getMgr.getTracer(super.getClass)
}
{code}

this object won't compile:
{code}
object CustomInstrumented extends Instrumented
{code}

If both are compiled in the same compiler invocation then it is successful, but if Instrumented is compiled first and then CustomInstrumented is compiled separately, I get this friendly exception:

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: malformed Scala signature of Instrumented2 at 1069; reference type ?0 of method getClass refers to nonexisting symbol.

{code}

I'm running 2.7.5.  I tried the latest build of 2.8 and I do not have this problem, so I'm assuming this fix (or a related one) fixed it.  I would really like to use Scala in my project but this issue leaves me dead in the water.  Any chance this fix would be patched to the 2.7.x branch?
