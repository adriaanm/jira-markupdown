When an assembly with number is referenced with a single natural number after a dot (for example: Microsoft.Build.Utilities.v4.0 or Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0), the generated assembly is not compilable (without escaping those assemblies). For escaping see the following example:
           extends    ['Microsoft.Build.Utilities.v4.0']'Microsoft.Build.Utilities.ToolTask'
instead of
           extends    [Microsoft.Build.Utilities.v4.0]'Microsoft.Build.Utilities.ToolTask'
With the closure of SI-6772, this goes out of scope.
