I can't figure out what the logic is here.  The typer only seems interested in whether A is a subtype of B, but the match is equally possible if B is a subtype of A, like it is.  This same confused relationship is a component of the brokenness in the core pattern matcher logic.

```scala
object obj
{
  case class A(x: Int)
  class B extends A(5)

  val x: Unit = (new B) match {
    case A(_) => println("found A")
    case _ => println("something else happened?")
  }
}
```
```scala
a.scala:7: error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : obj.A
 required: obj.B
    case A(_) => println("found A")
         ^
```
Replying to [comment:3 odersky]:
> That's exactly as specified. I am not adverse to changing the spec of pattern matching 9it is full of holes anyway). But this requires an effort larger than a ticket fix.

Is this the relevant portion of the spec?
```scala
The pattern matches all objects created from constructor invocations c(v1, ..., vn) where each element pattern pi matches the corresponding value vi .
```
If that is the whole of it, someone would be hard pressed to say whether "constructor invocations c(v1, ..., vn)" include or exclude super(v1, ..., vn) without checking with the implementation.  So unless this is made clearer elsewhere I propose that at least the spec should note that subclasses of case classes may be statically excluded from patterns involving that class.  I wouldn't have guessed going in that the pattern matcher actually prohibits some constructs which would otherwise match.
No, it's the discussion before that clause, which specs typing:
```scala
If the case class is monomorphic, then it
must conform to the expected type of the pattern, and the formal
parameter types of $$x$$'s primary constructor (\sref{sec:class-defs})
are taken as the expected types of the element patterns $$p_1\commadots
p_n$$.  If the case class is polymorphic, then its type parameters are
instantiated so that the instantiation of $$c$$ conforms to the expected
type of the pattern. The instantiated formal parameter types of $$c$$'s
primary constructor are then taken as the expected types of the
component patterns $$p_1\commadots p_n$$. 
```
