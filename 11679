Perhaps it's confused because there is a type alias in the package object. Is that supported?

scala> Region
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : badpack.Region.type
 required: Any
Note that Region extends Any, not AnyRef.
Such types can participate in value classes, but instances
cannot appear in singleton types or in reference comparisons.
