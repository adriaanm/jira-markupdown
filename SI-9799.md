The following codes failed when enabling -Yrepl-class-based.

```scala
$ build/quick/bin/scala -Yrepl-class-based

The above codes work well when disabling -Yrepl-class-based
So the solution proposed in PR 5210 will lead to re-initializing of a class declarations and all things even unrelated to the class declaration on remote machines.

@som-snytt Do we have a way to know what all implicit imports are required by a particular expression ? The same way as `referencedNames` in MemberHandler class.
Another problem caused by this import optimization reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17103 :
```scala
scala -Yrepl-class-based

scala> import java.io.File
import java.io.File

scala> class Test {val f=new File(".")}
<console>:11: error: not found: type File
       class Test {val f=new File(".")}
```

If we cannot get the correct wanted imports, I would suggest just removing this wrong optimization.
Hm..., this issue seems worse than I thought. It will ignore all wildcard imports. E.g.,

```scala
bin/scala -Yrepl-class-based
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_45).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> import java.text._
import java.text._

scala> class Foo() { val f = new SimpleDateFormat("hh") }
<console>:11: error: not found: type SimpleDateFormat
       class Foo() { val f = new SimpleDateFormat("hh") }
```
@zsxwing Looks like scala's jira has the similar issue already resolved in scala 2.11.9.
Please checkout #9734

Could you please check  that  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17103  is reproducible with scala 2.11.9?
