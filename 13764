I realize that overriding vals is known to be fraught with confusion and as I can't seem to form any intuition about what's supposed to happen I don't mean to add to it, but it seems safe that at least the runtime ClassFormatError is a bug.  Here is my test code:
```scala
object Vals {
  trait Happy { val status = "happy" }
  trait Sad { val status = "sad" }

  def go1 = (new AnyRef with Happy with Sad { override val status = "happysad" }).status
  def go2 = (new AnyRef with Happy with Sad { val blurp = "happysad" ; override val status = blurp }).status
  def go3 = (new AnyRef with Happy with Sad { override val status = blurp ; val blurp = "happysad" }).status
}

object Defs {
  trait Happy { def status = "happy" }
  trait Sad { def status = "sad" }

  def go1 = (new AnyRef with Happy with Sad { override def status = "happysad" }).status
  def go2 = (new AnyRef with Happy with Sad { def blurp = "happysad" ; override def status = blurp }).status
  def go3 = (new AnyRef with Happy with Sad { override def status = blurp ; def blurp = "happysad" }).status
}
```

Both scala 2.7.1 and trunk return "happysad" for all three functions in object Defs.  However, for scala 2.7.1 I get these results from Vals:
```scala
Vals.go1 = sad
Vals.go2 = happysad
Vals.go3 = null
```

Maybe that's all expected by smarter people than I, but for all three Vals functions trunk says:
```scala
java.lang.ClassFormatError: Repetitive method name/signature in class file Vals$$$$anon$$1
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:675)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:520)
```
