Your second suspicion nailed it. I downloaded the binaries scala-2.11.4.tgz **and** the sources scala-sources-2.11.4.tar.gz, and when extracted, they lived in the same root folder '/scala-2.11.4'. "forkjoin.jar.desired.sha1" is part of the scala-sources-2.11.4.tar.gz. 

Anyway, I extracted a fresh copy of 2.11.4 (no sources!) and the REPL and scalac work fine.
