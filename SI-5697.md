a simple definition of a case object:
{noformat}
case object Bippy
{noformat}
is serialized with a different serialVersionUID between 2.9.1 and 2.9.2. This causes issues in (for example) communication between remote actors running under different versions of scala. In the attached file TestSer.scala, first run "Ser" under 2.9.1 and then "Deser" under 2.9.2 and observe the following exception:

{noformat}
Exception in thread "main" java.io.InvalidClassException: test.Bippy$; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 4073568934824676524, local class serialVersionUID = 8501393720257665998

I would contend that this should be marked as a binary incompatibility.
But the quoted text is an observation on the _default_ implementation of serial UID.

Considering the prevalence of case objects *and the fact they are by default {{Serializable}}*, I would expect a _sensible_ implementation, _not the default implementation_. The sensible implementation for the serial UID of a singleton is a pure function of its "path".

If I'd had to mark it as {{Serializable}} myself, I would (of course) agree with you.
You are right :-) I was getting muddled between the library providing sensible serial UIDs (for stuff like {{Option}}, {{List}} etc) and the _compiler_ providing them.

I've even changed my mind and agree with the decision - sorry for the time wastage.
