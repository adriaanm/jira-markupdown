in Source.scala we see:
{code}
  /** convenience method, returns given line (not including newline)
   *  from Source.
   *
   *  @param line the line index, first line is 1
   *  @return     the character string of the specified line.
   *
   */
  def getLine(line: Int): String = getLines() drop (line - 1) next
{code}

yikes! being 1-indexed is just plain wrong, and anyway the entire method is redundant, and naive use of it is likely to have horrible performance (since it makes a new Iterator each time). I suggest this method be deprecated for 2.8.
