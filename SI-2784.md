I'm experiencing a really strange behaviour with named parameter: when I omit the dot for the method call, the named parameter are no more found. I'm really not sure how to explain it, so this is the code:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r20062-b20091209020151 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> object O { def f(a:String = "a") =println(a) }
defined module O

scala> O f(a="plop")
<console>:6: error: not found: value a
       O f(a = "plop")
           ^

scala> O.f(a = "plop")
plop

scala>
```
(In r20086) closes #2784
