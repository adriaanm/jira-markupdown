Usually, the pattern match translation converts a `Match`
to code consisting of if/else and label jumps.

However, if it able to express the result as a table switch,
it emits another `Match` node.

The pattern matcher phase's TypingTransformer then typechecks
that without an expected type, which needlessly lubs the
cases.

Will it Blend?

Still needs a little work:

```
Test suite finished with 3 cases failing:
fail - continuations-run/match2.scala  [compilation failed]% scalac match2.scala
match2.scala:9: error: error during expansion of this match (this is a scalac bug).
The underlying error was: type mismatch;
 found   : (String, String) @scala.util.continuations.cpsSynth @scala.util.continuations.cpsParam[String,String]
 required: (String, String)

    val (a, b) = shift { k: (((String,String)) => String) => k("A","B") }
```
