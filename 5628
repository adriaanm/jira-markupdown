Turns out supporting GC of bindings in the {{:reset}} command is much easier, we just need to make sure the classloader we're discarding is not retained as the context classloader of any thread or in a field of a runtime reflection mirror that we're storing in the REPL.

Fixing that perhaps doesn't go far enough to provide a useful answer for the enhancement request, however. From my commit comment:

    While this commit makes :reset perform its advertised function,
    it doesn't go further to making it a particulary useful command.
    Ideally we'd offer a mechanism to transport some data across a :reset
    boundary. The user could do something like this manually by stashing
    data in a `java.util.Map` hosted in some class in the same classloader
    as IMain. They would also have to restrict this to sending "pure data"
    rather than instances of data types defined in the REPL session
    itself.
