I'm having this problem with the scala REPL.

Home Key:
scala> 7~

End Key:
scala> 8~

I added the following to my .inputrc (taken from /etc/inputrc) to no avail:

"\e[7~": beginning-of-line
"\e[8~": end-of-line

There are a number of reports about similar issues in the jline site but people seem to have found workarounds that I'm not able to get working with the scala REPL:

I'm reporting this both in jline issue tracker and here just to make sure it's not because of an outdated jline.jar distributed with scala. I tried to "mv jline-2.9.jar /usr/share/scala/lib/jline.jar" but it just wreak havoc with the REPL.
