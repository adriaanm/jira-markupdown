Wow. That's *really* counterintuitive. Would it be possible to have a compiler warning when a var defined in an early initialization is captured by an inner class?

Alternatively, this seems like it should be fixable so that the current value is preserved if you box the var into a reference cell like you would for a local variable captured by an inner class (you can generate the read/write methods as normal, so this shouldn't have too wide reaching effects). But that probably counts as an enhancement and needs a SIP.
