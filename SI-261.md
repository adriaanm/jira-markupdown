(From [http://www.nabble.com/private-vals-in-traits--t4780372.html this mailing list thread])

Consider:
```scala
 trait A { val foo: String = "A" }
 trait B {
   private val foo: String = "B"
   def f = println(foo)
 }
 object Test extends Application with B with A {
   println(foo) // prints "A", as expected
   f            // prints "B", as expected
 }
```
This looks, good, but if I switch the order of B and A in the
declaration of Test, it doesn't compile, claiming that there's no such
value as foo.

Adriaan pointed out that this works in the interpreter, and I replied:

Interesting. I see now that it works in the interpreter (I hadn't
tried). But it does not work with scalac:
```scala
[~]% cat test.scala
trait A { val foo: String = "A" }
trait B {
   private val foo: String = "B"
   def f = println(foo)
}
object Test extends A with B {
   println(foo)
   f
}
[~]% scalac test.scala
test.scala:7: error: not found: value foo
   println(foo)
           ^
one error found
[~]% scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.6.0-final -- (c) 2002-2007 LAMP/EPFL

```

I would expect this to work in the compiler as it works in the interpreter. If this is *not* a compiler defect, I would also expect it to fail in the interpreter. (The above session is with 2.6.0, but the behavior is the same in 2.6.1-RC1.)
(In r22482) Test case closes #261, no review.
I'm sorry, this bug still exists in 2.8 final. If you look carefully at the test case, you will see that it tests the wrong thing!

In the test case, the order of the *declarations* of A and B are switched between the two versions:
```scala
trait A ...
trait B ...
```
vs 
```scala
trait B ...
trait A ...
```

But this has **nothing** to do with the bug!! The important change is the order of A and B *in the declaration of Test*:
```scala
object Test extends Application with A with B ... 
object Test extends Application with B with A ...  // this one fails!
```

In 2.8 final, it remains the case that this works correctly in the interpreter, and incorrectly in the compiler. There seems to be no change in behavior since the bug was opened. The original transcript I included when I opened the bug is still what I see with the new release.

Sorry to have to reopen this very old bug!

```scala
object Test extends Application with A with B ...  // THIS one fails...
object Test extends Application with B with A ...
```

Sorry for all the confusion, it is actually the *first* one ("A with B") which fails, as in the original bug. In the test case, both versions have "B with A".
See also slight variation in #7699 (marked as duplicate)
Yep!! Chalk up another three-digit bug for mr. Zaugg!

Verified to work with scalac from https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3440. 
I'll submit a PR with the test case.
