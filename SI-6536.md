Note, there are two work-arounds that solve this problem. One specific to this bug report and one more general.

The specific one is

{code}
class B extends A {
  class M {
    def z = "child" + B.super.a // B.super, not B.super[A]
 }
  override def a = ""
}
{code}

That works because this bug is only triggered when there is a type qualifier on a super access to an outer class. Get rid of the type qualifier and it's all good. But it's not fully general if you need to decide among several different sources for 'a'.

The more general work around is to manually do your own accessor

{code}
class B extends A {
  class M {
    def z = "child" + a_a // access using a hand-written accessor
 }
  override def a = ""
  private[this] def a_a = super[A].a
}
{code}

James, we've been requested to fix this by 2.9.3. Could you have a look?

{code}
public class B$M extends java.lang.Object implements scala.ScalaObject{
public final B $outer;

public java.lang.String z();
  Code:
   0:	new	#9; //class scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder
   3:	dup
   4:	invokespecial	#13; //Method scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder."<init>":()V
   7:	ldc	#16; //String child
   9:	invokevirtual	#20; //Method scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder;
   12:	aload_0
   13:	invokespecial	#25; //Method A.a:()Ljava/lang/String;
   16:	invokevirtual	#20; //Method scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder;
   19:	invokevirtual	#28; //Method scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder.toString:()Ljava/lang/String;
   22:	areturn

public B B$M$$$outer();
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	getfield	#34; //Field $outer:LB;
   4:	areturn

public B$M(B);
  Code:
   0:	aload_1
   1:	ifnonnull	12
   4:	new	#37; //class java/lang/NullPointerException
   7:	dup
   8:	invokespecial	#38; //Method java/lang/NullPointerException."<init>":()V
   11:	athrow
   12:	aload_0
   13:	aload_1
   14:	putfield	#34; //Field $outer:LB;
   17:	aload_0
   18:	invokespecial	#41; //Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
   21:	return

}
{code}
The instructions 
{code}
   12:	aload_0
   13:	invokespecial	#25; //Method A.a:()Ljava/lang/String;
{code}

would be correct if z were defined directly on B. But the intervening class M means it should be going through the M instance's outer field to get to the enclosing B instance first.
The trees look sound all the way through
{code}
  class B$M extends java.lang.Object with ScalaObject {
    def z(): java.lang.String = "child".+(B$M.this.B$M$$$outer().super[A].a());
{code}

But the icode isn't right
{code}
  def z(): java.lang.String {
  locals: 
  startBlock: 1
  blocks: [1]
  
  1: 
    6	CALL_PRIMITIVE(StartConcat)
    6	CONSTANT("child")
    6	CALL_PRIMITIVE(StringConcat(REF(class String)))
    6	THIS(B$M)
    6	CALL_METHOD A.a (super(A))
    6	CALL_PRIMITIVE(StringConcat(REF(class String)))
    6	CALL_PRIMITIVE(EndConcat)
    6	RETURN(REF(class String))
    
  }
{code}

Line 770 of GenICode does a pattern match like so 
{code}
        case Apply(fun @ Select(Super(_, mix), _), args) =>
{code}

It ignores the tree that's the left argument of Super, assuming it will be a This.
Line 121 of SuperAccessors has a condition

{code}      if (name.isTermName && mix == tpnme.EMPTY && (clazz.isTrait || clazz != currentClass || !validCurrentOwner)) {code}

which this call fails because mix is not empty, and thus the tree isn't transformed with an accessor.

Changing the condition to

{code}      if (name.isTermName && ((mix == tpnme.EMPTY && clazz.isTrait) || clazz != currentClass || !validCurrentOwner)) {code}

seems to solve this bug and doesn't break the case where A is a trait. However, this is some subtle stuff so I'm digging in to understand exactly what the condition is detecting/preventing. For instance, the name "mix" suggests that it actually SHOULD be empty in this case so maybe the real problem lies upstream.

It would still be prudent to harden {{GenICode}} to ensure that only {{tpnme.EMPTY}} makes it that far.
Poking around I found a a variation which crashes the compiler in mixin rather than generating a VerifyError. I think this will naturally be scooped up by the fix you're already on, but for completeness.
{code}
class O1 { def f = "" } // O1 must be a class
class O2 extends O1 {
  class T1 { def g = O2.super[O1].f } // ok
  trait T2 { def g = O2.super[O1].f } // crash
}
