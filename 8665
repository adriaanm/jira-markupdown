@Viktor: After some trial and error, exceptions are reported, _except_ in the rare case where an exception occurs in the onFailure method. I was just happy it worked, and I didn't consider this case since it never happened to me. Okay, I agree this is definitely _not_ a good thing for the release, so I'll try the patch later tonight, will keep you posted.
