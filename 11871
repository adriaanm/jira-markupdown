JLine handles the tab for completion, but "42.\ttoString" has the same result both at the prompt and in paste mode. It erroneously detects completion.
{code}
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

42.
%   +   >    >>>            isInstanceOf   toDouble   toLong     unary_+   |   
&   -   >=   ^              toByte         toFloat    toShort    unary_-       
*   /   >>   asInstanceOf   toChar         toInt      toString   unary_~       
42.toString

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

res0: String = 42

{code}
Didn't JLine try to detect pasted tabs?
