right now every macro definition needs its own macro implementation. if several definitions require almost identical implementations it would be nice to use the same implementation several time, but pass in a different parameter for slightly different behavior. Right now a forwarder implementation is required. (I can add a code example later)
BTW, paulp has a branch where you can express singleton types for literals.

```scala
type intType = 1.type
```

So in that universe, you could pass constants to macros as type args.
