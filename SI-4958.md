Summing list sequentially and in parallel produces two different results.

The following test fails:
```scala
// summands of Leibniz formula for pi
val list = 0 until 10000 map { i => BigDecimal(4) * (1 - (i % 2) * 2) / (2 * i + 1) }

val piSeq = list sum
val piPar = list.par sum

assert(piSeq == piPar)
```
I guess even BigDecimals are not commutative under addition.

This is related to #4658, because for your actual example neither sum nor reduceLeft are necessary, because the result can be determined algorithmically. 
Not a bug.  Create your BigDecimals with java.math.MathContext.UNLIMITED and you will get the same result from both (both will throw exceptions for non-terminating decimal expansions.) When you perform rounding operations in different orders, you get different results.
