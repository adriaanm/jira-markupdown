In Combinatorics, there are two important concept: permutation and combination.
I don't know if it is too much to add combination to SeqLike.

{code}
   /**
     combinations of n-elements from this seq
   */
   def combinations(n: Int): Iterator[Repr]
{code}
It would perform as:
Seq(1,1,1,2,2).combinations(2) => [1,1],[1,2],[2,2]

Correspondingly, 
{code}
   /**
     permutations of n-elements from this seq
   */
   def permutations(n: Int): Iterator[Repr] = 
       combinations(n) flatMap { _.permutations }
{code}
