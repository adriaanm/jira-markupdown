I think the naming of the methods "drop" / "dropRight" is bad and confusing. I can see some similarity to "foldLeft" and "foldRight" which are more clear. I suggest that[[BR]]
[[BR]]
- either "drop" is accordingly renamed to "dropLeft"[[BR]]
- or alternatively, I think renaming "dropRight" to "keep" would greatly enhance legibility.

sorry, i just realize that "keep" would have other semantics. so to make it clear:


{code}
(1 to 10).drop( 2 )
// result:
Range(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

(1 to 10).keep( 2 )
// suggested result:
Range(1, 2)
{code}

so to clarify, i think that adding this "keep" method would be a good enhancement.
