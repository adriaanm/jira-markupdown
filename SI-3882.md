Fails as below since at least r23034, up to and including r23144.  Compiles with 2.8.0 and the 2.8.1 RCs.
```scala
% scalac29 -d /tmp -optimise src/library/scala/collection/immutable/LongMap.scala
error: Illegal index: 0 overlaps List((variable par1,LONG))
error: Illegal index: 0 overlaps List((variable par1,LONG))
two errors found
```
Boy, that sounded really promising.  Unfortunately I can't reproduce it based on what you've given.  A full reproduction would be appreciated.
(extempore in [r25880](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25880)) Debugging note.

Pinpointed line which gave us #3882.  In case a remedy
suggest itself to you, review by dragos.
The new optimizer http://magarciaepfl.github.io/scala/ isn't prone to `ICodeReader` bugs (because it doesn't use it anymore).
