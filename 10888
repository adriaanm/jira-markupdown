I closed scala/bug#6530 on the grounds that Scala code should not ever refer to module class or inner classes with the $ syntax. So I'm going to do the same for this one.

Admiteddly, the spec doesn't quite rule it out:

"The ‘$’ character is reserved for compiler-synthesized identifiers. User programs should not define identifiers which contain ‘$’ characters."

The workaround in this case (which I'm sure you've figure out, but just for the record) is:
```scala
O.getClass.isInstance(b)
```
