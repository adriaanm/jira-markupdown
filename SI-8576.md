As noticed in the instability of the new test for #8549 under -Xcheckinit:

Marking as a blocker for 2.11.1 as the release is intended to fix serialization issues.
making the fields ~~volatile~~ transient seems appealing to me. the lost “safety” seems to me like nothing anyone would have expected or counted on anyway. I would actually have expected the fields to be ~~volatile~~ transient in the first place.

I'm not sure I've understood it fully, but perhaps the issue with readResolve is something we could simply document?
I assume you mean transient, not volatile. The confusion was probably caused by looking at my attempted fix for #7838 (where I made the same mistake) just before commenting on this ticket.

Reversing the meaning of the bits might work. Field initializers are not run before deserialization. You could use a field initializer to set the bits upon proper construction of the object and end up with unset bits after deserialization.
