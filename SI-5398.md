Scala's compiler prints several types ambiguously.

For example:
- functions that takes n arguments of type A, B, C, .. and functions that take a single n-tuple (A, B, C, ...) argument.
- higher-order functions (A => B) => C and curried functions A => B => C.

This can produce some confusing type errors such as

`scala> k(z)`
`<console>:10: error: type mismatch;`
`&nbsp;found : Int => Int => Int`
`&nbsp;required: Int => Int => Int`

Or

`scala> h(g)`
`<console>:10: error: type mismatch;`
`&nbsp;found : (Int, Int) => Int`
`&nbsp;required: (Int, Int) => Int`

Here's a gist of how to set up these particular type errors: https://gist.github.com/1655807
Please search for existing tickets before opening new ones.  Already fixed in trunk.  However all is not lost, I used this ticket as motivation to backport those two commits for 2.9.2.
```
scala> def k( j : (Int => Int) => Int ) : Int = j(_+1)
k: (j: (Int => Int) => Int)Int

scala> def p(q : Int => Int) : Int = q(0)
p: (q: Int => Int)Int

scala> def z = (x : Int) => (y : Int) => x + y
z: Int => (Int => Int)

scala> k(p)
res0: Int = 1

scala> k(z)
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int => (Int => Int)
 required: (Int => Int) => Int
              k(z)
                ^
```
Oh, and
```
scala> h(g)
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : ((Int, Int)) => Int
 required: (Int, Int) => Int
              h(g)
                ^
```
