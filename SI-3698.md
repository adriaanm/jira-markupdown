I wanted to try the Scala actors and found a documentation which isn't very helpful. Some diamonds I found:

```scala
def   getState: Value
Returns the execution state of this actor.
returns the execution state 
```

That's what I could guess from the name. But which states are possible and how do they change?

or

```scala
def link(to: AbstractActor): AbstractActor
Links self to actor to.
to
the actor to link to
returns
    the parameter actor 
```

Is the link not used by the actor itself? If yes, for what? What happens if I link the same actors multiple times?

My questions were:[[BR]]
- How to build a robust network of actors that continues to work even if an actor crashes[[BR]]
- Can the receiver find the sender of a message?[[BR]]
- How can the sender determine if the receiver still works? Or does the framework restarts the receiver automatically?[[BR]]

The documentation wasn't very helpful!
Akka has been the default actor library since 2.10, and Scala actors are very deprecated, so I think this can safely be closed.

Also, Akka has an incredibly good [documentation](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala.html) and a good [migration guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/actors-migration-guide.html).
