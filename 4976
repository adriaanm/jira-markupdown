I tried looking back and found this: https://chara2.epfl.ch/r/515/

"The problem with the current implementation is that it adds a rather heavyweight method to every case class. This is a lot of additional code for not a lot of appreciable gain"

But I think toString has 2 differences:
 1. it is already a method implemented for the case class
 2. it is less heavyweight than productElementName (which switches according to an index). 

So if I have:
{code}
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
{code}

the toString can be:
{code}
public String toString() { return ScalaRunTime..MODULE$$._toString(this, "name", "age");}
{code}

where _toString is:
{code}
def _toString(p: Product, names: String*)
{code}
