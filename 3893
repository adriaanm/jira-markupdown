I don't see the error in 2.8.0.RC1 or r21666:
```scala
$$ scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
$$ scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
Recompiling 2 files
$$ scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
Recompiling 2 files
$$
```

It might be a problem that the Java files are always recompiled, but that is a separate issue.
