To amplify the above, the policy that makes the most sense to me is, "2.7 code that uses collections may have to change when migrated to 2.8, but code written to the 2.8 API will not need to change when migrating to 2.9."

Right now we have "2.7 code may have to change when migrating to 2.8, and also new 2.8 code may have to change when migrating to 2.9."
