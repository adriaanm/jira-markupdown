For Java development, ctl+shift+o (command+shift+o on OSX) organizes the imports used/needed in a Java source file. The net effect is that only/all imports for classes used within the source file are listed alphabetically at the top of the source file. Wildcard imports are expanded, unused imports are dropped, and missing imports (required for classes actually used in the file) are added. In the case of ambiguity (e.g. use of unqualified List type), a dialog containing all relevant types (e.g. java.util.List, com.sun.tools.javac.util.List, and java.awt.List) is displayed and the user is prompted to select the type to import. There has been discussion on the [scala] mailing list re having equivalent functionality in the Scala plugin.
