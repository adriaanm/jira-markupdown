Misterbeebee: When I first opened the ticket, I found this problem when making repeated builds from eclipse.  Eclipse 3.4 'clean' tasks were not always removing all the proper subdirectories under 'scala/build'.  Once I did a clean pull from svn I was able to get a successful build repeatedly as long as I manually cleared the 'scala/build' subdirectories.  Can you try clearing the build directory?

Also I find the build on my windows system fails every time on the 'fixcrlf' action during an attempt to apparently rename a temporary file.  I just commented out the 'fixcrlf' action for now.
