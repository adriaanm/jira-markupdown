I run into this problem when refactoring the cake:
{code}
trait Outer { outer =>
  val other: Other
  // type checks
  val f = (Outer.this.other: outer.other.type)
  // fails to type check:
  // type mismatch;
  // found : Outer.this.other.type (with underlying type Other)
  // required: Outer{val other: Outer.this.other.type}
  val alias: Outer { val other: outer.other.type } = Outer.this 
}

abstract class Other
{code}

This looks like should be trivially true but it fails to type check. According to Adriaan it fails because narrowing of types is to shallow and is not being applied to members.

This will be probably closed as Won't Fix but I filed it just for record.
It can lose several of the players:
{code}
trait Outer {
  val x: Object
  def alias: Outer { val x: Outer.this.x.type } = this
}
{code}

Also, it's a duplicate of SI-4663.
See also SI-6767 and the other tickets linked there. I'm not sure there's any benefit in opening more variations on "the singleton type is not correctly propagated."
Also, I'm sure you can head off a few dozen duplicates-to-be by reading the issues I have reported which are still open. There are 142 of them. I promise you will encounter enough of these issues in practice to justify the initial investment. I put an awful lot of increasingly pointless-seeming work into them. Here they are.
