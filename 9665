Fair enough. 
For what it's worth, I had actually come across SI-4427 but it did not click that it was the very same situation.
I also had checked the spec of course (my very first step) but the version at scala-lang.org is sadly not up to date and don't mention package objects.

In any case, there is still a bug lying around. As I said I got a "bad symbolic reference ..." error in another project. 
Only when I tried to narrow it down did I encounter the implicit resolution oddness (which I now understand is intentional) which I thought was the real bug (with the "bad symbolic reference" error being some kind of by-product). 
And when adding an explicit import for the implicit value (as opposed to relying on having it in scope by the mere fact of being in the package object), the "bad symbolic reference ..." error got away.

I will try to make another project reproducing the "bad symbolic reference" error and open another bug.
