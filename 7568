All of these compile:
```scala
  Nil map // foo
  identity

  Nil map
  // foo
  identity
  
  Nil map
  // foo
  // foo
  identity
  
  Nil map /* foo 
  */ identity
  
  Nil map /* foo */
  identity
  
  Nil map /* 
  foo 
  */
  identity
  
  Nil map /* 
  foo 
  foo
  foo
  */
  identity
```
But THIS does not (compare with last example.)
```scala
  Nil map /* 



  */
  identity
```
So you can make code uncompilable by changing the content of the comment, without even changing the number of newlines in it! It looks like a completely blank line is being counted as an nl token even if it's inside a block comment, but a line with any non-whitespace is not.

I can find pretty much nothing on how comments translate into whitespace in the spec.
