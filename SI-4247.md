= problem =

Collections have the methods

```scala
drop, dropWhile (from the left)
dropRight       (from the right)
```

but there is no `dropRightWhile`, no complete symmetry
of dropping from the left or from the right. why not?

The same is true for the method "take": `take, takeWhile, takeRight`, but no `takeRightWhile`

= suggestion =

SeqLike has the twins  
```scala
indexWhere( p: (A) => Boolean ) : Int
lastIndexWhere( p: (A) => Boolean ) : Int
```
so you could define

```scala
def takeRightWhile( p: (A) => Boolean ) = drop ( lastIndexWhere( !p(_) ) + 1 )
```

Frank
We are generally averse to methods with more than two names in them. And the collection libraries are pretty much fixed. So I keep this as an enhancement request, but don't assign to anyone.
