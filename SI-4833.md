I would expect that when I iterate over a `PriorityQueue`, that this would reproduce the order of the queue. This is not the case, and as a consequence, calling `toSeq`, `toList`, or `toIndexedSeq` on a PQ produces unexpected results.

{code}
val m = new collection.mutable.PriorityQueue[Double]
m.enqueue(84.13,83.92,82.93,83.57,82.89,81.31,82.35,81.04,82.509995)
m.toList
// -> List(84.13, 83.92, 82.93, 83.57, 82.89, 81.31, 82.35, 81.04, 82.509995) -- oh no!
m.dequeueAll : List[Double]
// -> List(84.13, 83.92, 83.57, 82.93, 82.89, 82.509995, 82.35, 81.31, 81.04) -- right!
{code}

Although a simple solution could be to warn in those methods that `dequeueAll` should be used if ordered results are wanted, I would still consider this a bug (apart from the fact that `dequeueAll` is destructive, so there is no way to get an ordered snapshot of the PQ without emptying it).

As an argument for fixing, I would like to point out that `SortedSet` behaves as expected:

{code}
val s = collection.immutable.SortedSet(84.13,83.92,82.93,83.57,82.89,81.31,82.35,81.04,82.509995)
s.toList
// -> List(81.04, 81.31, 82.35, 82.509995, 82.89, 82.93, 83.57, 83.92, 84.13) -- right!
{code}
