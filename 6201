I'm getting:
```scala
error: scala.reflect.internal.Types$TypeError: value it  is not a member of Bounds[B]{}
```

For some reason the `typedThis` in the typechecker:
```scala
      def typedThis(qual: Name) = tree.symbol orElse qualifyingClass(tree, qual, packageOK = false) match {
        case NoSymbol => tree
        case clazz    =>
          log("typedThis: " + qual)
          tree setSymbol clazz setType clazz.thisType.underlying
          if (isStableContext(tree, mode, pt)) tree setType clazz.thisType else tree
      }
```

does not add `lazy val it` to the list of members. I'm trying to figure this out.
