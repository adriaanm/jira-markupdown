It's pretty hard to know what's happening without source code to reproduce the problem. You could minimize by paring down your test sources until the problem goes away; if they are relatively disentangled, that's doable with a binary search.

But I took a look at the heap dump anyway to see what I could glean. There is an enormous AST generated at this point in your code:

{code}
  test("1 requiredParam") {
    implicit val v = mock[Validator]
    (v.validate _).expects(*).returning(true)
       // ^-- here
{code}

(The test sources are visible in the heap dump)

I suspect the root cause is a bug in, or at least related to, ScalaMock. Try commenting out all tests using ScalaMock tests to confirm this.

You could try to see the output of compiling just that file in more detail.

Here's one way:

  - Temporarily introduce a compile error in the test sources
  - With SBT, run `export test:compile`. This will print out the full classpath used by the compiler.
  - From the command line run `scalac -Xprint:all -classpath <copy/paste classpath from previous step> /path/to/RequestValidatorTest`
