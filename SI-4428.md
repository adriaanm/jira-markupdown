The spec in section 3.2.5 claims tuples will implement at least the following methods.
```scala
trait Productn[+T1, +T2, +Tn] {
  override def arity = n
  def _1: T1 ...
  def _n: Tn
}
```
The method actually implemented is called productArity.
(In r24669) Brought spec into line with implementation regarding
the name of the productArity method.  Closes #4428, no review.
