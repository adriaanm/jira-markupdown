(In r24084) Fixing the positions for catch block expressions.  I think this
is right for the situation, but positions are not my strongest thing.
I used atPos on the entire new block and marked it with the position
of the expression (+ makeTransparent.) If that sounds suboptimal
to anyone let me know.  Closes SI-4182, no review.
