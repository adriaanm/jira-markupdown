It seems that, when dealing with implicit resolution, the order of definition of classes and companion object matters. The minimal example I was able to cook up is:
{code}
trait Counter[A] {
  def count(a: A): Int
}

object Foo {
  def foo[A](a: A)(implicit c: Counter[A]) = c.count(a)
}

case class Bar(id: Int) {
  import Foo._

  def count = foo(this)
}

object Bar {
  implicit object BarCounter extends Counter[Bar] {
    def count(b: Bar) = b.id
  }
}
{code}
This fails to compile saying "could not find implicit value for parameter c: Counter[Bar]"

On the other hand, if we define object Bar before case class Bar, it compiles fine.

I should also mention that this problem only arises with implicit resolution. If we explicitly pass the BarCounter object, everything compiles fine.
