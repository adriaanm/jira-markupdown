When I use this method from Libgdx library: http://tinyurl.com/assetmanager-get with Java signature
```scala
public synchronized <T> T get (String fileName)
```
I'm getting dead code warning when compiled under Scala 2.10.3 with -Ywarn-dead-code option:
```scala
dead code following this construct
[warn]       val asset = assetManager.get(name)
[warn]                                   ^
```
(asset is used further in code, and works as expected).

Adding even basic "Any" type information, like
```scala
val asset: Any = assetManager.get(name)
```
silences the warning. 

I asked this on scala-user ( https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-user/npN5v00SehU ) and was asked to open bug report here.
It is used like this:
```scala
managers(name).packAsset(asset)
```
where
```scala
packAsset[T](asset: T): Option[Asset]
```
has implementation dependent on name (like file extension). Those methods look like
```scala
  def packAsset[T](asset: T): Option[Asset] = asset match {
    case (gdxAsset: GdxBitmapFont) => Some(BitmapFontAsset(gdxAsset))
    case _ => None
  }
```
I use this to pack unrelated classes from Java library (not having common parent other than Object) into AnyVal subclasses of Asset trait, and include type information that was previously enclosed only in fileName: String.

In that case adding "Any" to asset value is valid thing to do?
Right, it's being used as a blank key into a table, not as an instance of anything in particular. The right thing to do is call get like
```scala
assetManager.get[Object](name)
```
Then you aren't at the mercy of type inference. The even more right thing to do is never call that method.
