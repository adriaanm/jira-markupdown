=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Try to run code below 
```scala
var i = 0;
def translate(text: String): String = {
    println(i + " -> " + text)
    i += 1

    return "!%s!".format(text)
}

val xmlNode = <a><b><c><h1>Hello Example</h1></c></b></a>;

new RuleTransformer(new RewriteRule {
    override def transform(n: Node): Seq[Node] = n match {
        case t: Text if !t.text.trim.isEmpty => Text(translate(t.text.trim))
        case _ => n
    }
}).transform(xmlNode);
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
script should output
0 -> Hello Example


=== What do you see instead? ===
0 -> Hello Example
1 -> Hello Example
2 -> Hello Example
...
30 -> Hello Example
31 -> Hello Example

transform function called 32 times

=== Additional information ===
Bug in BaseTransformer, you should avoid calling transform (recursive) function 2 times

For example you can change current definition by following 
def transform(ns: Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] =
    if (ns.isEmpty) ns
    else {
        val head = ns.head
        val transformed = transform(ns.head)
        (if (head eq transformed) head else transformed) ++ transform(ns.tail)
    }
};

or just
def transform(ns: Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] =
    if (ns.isEmpty) ns else transform(ns.head) ++ transform(ns.tail)

If you need more info please let me know

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: 1.6.0_21
  - Operating system: Windows 7 64 bit
Anyone who threads this, beware!

The solution suggested has a big problem (or consequence) -- non-transformed XMLs still generate new data. Or, speaking through code,

```scala
val a = <a><b/></a>
val b = new RuleTransformer(new RewriteRule {})(a)
a eq b
```

This is true presently, would be false with either of the suggested modifications. It would also break this code:

```scala
       if (ch eq nch) n
       else           Elem(n.prefix, n.label, n.attributes, n.scope, nch: _*)
```

I think a better solution would be something like this:

```scala
def transform(ns: Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] = {
    val changed = ns flatMap transform
    if (changed.length != ns.length || (changed, ns).zipped.exists(_ != _)) changed
    else ns
}
```

That said, I never realized that fixing the double call to `transform` would change RuleTransformer from `O(2^depth)` to `O(depth)` (ignoring the length component of complexity). It's hard to understate that possible gains in performance.
Ok, I was mistaken. I mean, I was mistaken to suggest I never realized calling `transform` twice makes it exponential -- I did, and opened a ticket about it. This is a duplicate of #3689, and the solution I present there is probably slower, but works much harder at preserving referential equality of unchanged nodes, for whatever that is worth.

Specifically, the solution here only preserves children of a node if none of the siblings is modified. The solution there preserves all nodes where no changes are made.
