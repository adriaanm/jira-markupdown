In particular I think they ought to have an analog of mutable.Map's transform: something which applies a function to every element in the sequence, updating in place.  Seq[A] => (A => A) => Seq[A].  Proposed catchy name: "transform".
(In r24042) Integrated contributed non-recursive implementation of permutations,
combinations, subsets, by EastSun.  Also gave mutable Seqs an
in-place transform method like the one Map has.  And couldn't
resist slightly reformulating a few set methods, because how can we
settle for "forall(that.contains)" when we could have "this forall that".
(Which is also what normal people hear when we talk about sets.)

Closes #4060, #3644, review by moors.
