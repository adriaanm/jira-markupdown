Just tried with several combinations of `-Yinline` for `test1.scala` and `test2.scala`, as well as with and without `-optimize`, against [026a70d55591c3b5ee157e22998b62168afee686 ](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/026a70d55591c3b5ee157e22998b62168afee686). In all cases there was no `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError`.
