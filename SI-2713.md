Programmers around the world spend a lot of time debugging NullPointerExceptions.

While I agree that a coding style that prevents null values should be favoured as much as possible, NPE's is a fact of life.

Scala should provide as much information as possible when a NPE occours. Ideally the "." where the NPE happens. 

The expected type of the method or field that returns null is also useful.

It would be acceptable if the enhanced NullPointerExceptions could only be showed if the code is compiled with debug information.
Same comment as preformattet text
```scala
scala> class A;

scala> class B { val a: A = null }

scala> class C { val b: B = null }

scala> val b1 = new B
b1: B = B@17834de

scala> val c1 = new C
c1: C = C@1a3551c

scala> c1.b
res0: B = null

scala> c1.b.a
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at .<init>(<console>:9)
        at .<clinit>(<console>)

Examples of what I would like instead:

scala> c1.b.a
scala.NullPointerException "c1.b <- is null"
			at ... <snip> ...
		
scala> c1.b.a
scala.NullPointerException "c1.b.a"
                                ^ Unexpected null value
								
scala> c1.b.a
scala.NullPointerException "Value of type A on instance of B was null"
			at ... <snip> ...
								
```
