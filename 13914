The following test would compile fine, but throws a ClassNotFoundException.

The motive of doing this is to define a transparent type alias aliasing both the type with the "type" keyword and the object with a "val".
```scala
package mytest

object testfloat {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    val Alias = Float
    println(Alias.Epsilon)
  }
}
```

However, after modifying "val" to "def", everything works beautifully.
```scala
package mytest

object testfloat {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    def Alias = Float
    println(Alias.Epsilon)
  }
}
```
