Given a Java class defined like this:
{code}
#!java
package com.example;

public abstract class Test{
       protected static class Inner{}
       protected abstract Inner getInner();
}
{code}
It is not possible to implement this class in Scala from another package:

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.3.final (OpenJDK Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0).
scala> import com.example.Test
import com.example.Test

scala> class Implementor extends Test{
    | import Test.Inner
    | def getInner:Inner = null
    | }
<console>:7: error: class Inner cannot be accessed in object com.example.Test
      def getInner:Inner = null
                   ^
{code}
This aside, Inner is not in scope as you would expect it to be:
{code}
scala> class Implementor extends Test{
    | def getInner:Inner = null
    | }
<console>:6: error: not found: type Inner
      def getInner:Inner = null
                   ^
{code}
To put that into context: I ran into the problem when I tried to write some Android code. When implementing [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Filter.html android.widget.Filter] you'll have to return an instance of [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Filter.FilterResults.html Filter.FilterResults]. This class is a static protected inner class which cannot be accessed from Scala. I've spotted no other protected inner classes in Android yet.

The workaround is to create an abstract class in Java implementing the interface which wraps accesses to the inner class. One may then implement this abstract class from Scala.

In this particular case:
{code}
#!java
import android.widget.BaseAdapter;
import android.widget.Filter;

public abstract class MyFilter<T> extends Filter{
        private final BaseAdapter parent;
        public MyFilter(BaseAdapter parent) {
                this.parent = parent;
        }

        @Override
        protected FilterResults performFiltering(CharSequence constraint) {
                FilterResults res = new FilterResults();
                T value = getResult(constraint);
                res.values = value;
                res.count = countFromData(value);
                return res;

        }
        @Override
        protected void publishResults(CharSequence constraint, FilterResults res) {
                setData(res.count,(T) res.values);
                if (res.count == 0)
                        parent.notifyDataSetInvalidated();
                else
                        parent.notifyDataSetChanged();
        }
        protected abstract void setData(int count,T data);
        protected abstract int countFromData(T data);
        protected abstract T getResult(CharSequence constraint);
}
{code}

Hmm, I think I understand the problem: Scala interprets the Java class (`Test` resp. `Filter`) as a class *and* a companion object holding all the static members. So the easiest fix is not feasible - to allow implementing classes access to (protected) members of the companion object of the implemented class - because it would affect Scala code as well. So, could perhaps _protected_ static inner classes not be interpreted as (non-static) member classes as well? (What's the use case of protected static inner classes of objects in Scala?)

BTW: Why does the import work, shouldn't that be disallowed as well?
I disagree. We can never achieve 100% java interop without becoming Java. We are at 99.5% now, and the further we go, the more expensive in terms of feature creep things are going to become. Static protected members are, next to raw types, the most ugly, useless feature of Java I know. For instance, when I google for static protected, here's what comes up on number 1:

There's no way we can simulate static protected without impairing the integrity of Scala's object model in a fundamental way. I refuse to let that happen. So, please keep the bug closed. We have been several times through this. I think it's unlikely I will change my position.

Sorry, that should have been "real and important *Java* code" in the first para.

Also ... what Paul said: treating those Java statics as public would do the trick without in any way compromising the Scala object model or type system.
(extempore in [r25056|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25056]) Carved out access exception for java protected statics, which
otherwise cannot be accessed from scala.  Changes close status
of #1806, no review.
