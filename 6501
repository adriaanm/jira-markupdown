The formatting seems wrong.

{quote}
So, the rule is that if the scaladoc starts on the /\* line like:

{noformat}
/** blah blah
{noformat}

It is treated as the documentation. If the line is blank like:

{noformat}
/**
 * blah blah
{noformat}

The inherited docs are inserted followed by these docs.
{quote}

Right?
