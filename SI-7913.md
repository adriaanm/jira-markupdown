Let we have next code snippet:

https://github.com/rssh/scala-training-materials/blob/master/macro-experimental/misc/bugMacroApply/src/main/scala/x/X.scala

Where we have method apply() defined in type provider.
Than we see that x.xProvider.apply(1) is compiled but x.xProvider(1) - not.

(can be illustrated by 
https://github.com/rssh/scala-training-materials/blob/master/macro-experimental/misc/bugMacroApply/src/test/scala/tieSpec.scala
)


(full test-case as archive is attached)
I refined the issue into #7914. 

Please indicate whether it's a blocker for your use case. In case if it is, I can still fix it for 2.11.0-M7, the last development milestone of 2.11.0.
