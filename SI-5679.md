In scala 2.9.2 Range is an extension of Seq.
For me Range class is an extension of Set class, I don't understand scala implementation choice.
Indeed, it is possible to have a range like : Range(1,2,3,2,3,1).
For me it makes no sense.

For exemple:

{code:title=scala1|borderStyle=solid}
    scala> Range(1,4) ++ Range(2,4) ++ Range(1,2)
    res1: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1)
```scala

Or
{code:title=scala1|borderStyle=solid}
    scala> Range(1,4).union(Range(2,4))
    res2: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 2, 3, 2, 3)
```

Moreover, union methode or ++ operator do not produce Range object but a IndexedSeq object.

It not what it is inside api doc at use-cases descriptions (http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Range)

And, it is impossible to convert easily IndexedSeq in Range.


Why it is possible to have a Range with values can be duplicated ?
Why it is impossible to get a Range object with a union ?
What's the fourth number in the Range {{Int.MaxInt to Int.MaxInt - 10 by -1}}? That's a question you can answer on a {{Seq}}, but not on a {{Set}}. What's the output of {{1 to 10 foreach println}}? Again, a question that can be answers on a {{Seq}}, but not on a {{Set}}. What is the difference between {{1 to 10}} and {{1 to 10 by -1}}? They are different {{Seq}}, but identical {{Set}}.

Scala's `Range` fit needs that are not adequately solved by a `Set`.

Not that I'd not like a class that implemented mathematical ranges, where the main method was `contains`, not `foreach`.
