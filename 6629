I believe the generic implementation could be sped up by adding, before `b \+\+= thisCollection`, also `b.sizeHint(length \+ 1)`. Considering that `this` will be a `WrappedArray` (IIRC), `b` should be a `WrappedArrayBuilder`. To finish the implementation, one should add `\+\+=` to `WrappedArrayBuilder` - for instance by copying or reusing `ArrayBuffer.\+\+=`. I believe the combined effect of these optimizations should be close to or indistinguishable from your proposed implementation, while being more general.

Of course, the same change as for `:\+` should also be done for `\+:`.
