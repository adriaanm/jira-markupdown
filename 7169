It is only slightly faster.  Of course if it ends up being considerably *slower* in Scala for whatever reason, we shouldn't do it.  But I'm not particularly interested in writing code only to have it not used because it's "about the same speed".  The only reason to do it is either (1) we want to stay current with the (now-fixed-in-stone) MurmurHash3 algorithm, or (2) we want versions with more bits (and the higher-bit-number variants are easier to implement in the new scheme).  If we want neither (1) nor (2), I'm not sure I want to bet several hours on my time on something that may not even get used.  If speed is the only reason to accept it, give me relative timing targets for long and short hashes that would make it worthwhile, and I'll consider whether I think the code will achieve that.  (E.g. "short hashes must not be slower and long hashes must be at least 20% faster for it to be worth replacing it".)
