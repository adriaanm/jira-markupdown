=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
/** Classes and traits inheriting the `DelayedInit` marker trait
 *  will have their initialization code rewritten as follows.
 *  <code>   becomes   delayedInit(<code>)
 *  Initialization code comprises all statements and all value definitions
 *  that are executed during initialization.
 */
{code} 

ScalaDoc interprets the "<code>" as a formatting instruction and breaks the documentation.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Replace "<code>" by something that looks less like HTML markup.
Additionally ScalaDoc should fail or warn, if there are things which it perceives as unclosed tags.

=== What do you see instead? ===
