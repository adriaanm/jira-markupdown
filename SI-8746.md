This code compiles and runs on Scala 2.9.3, but throws an NPE when run with 2.10.  The NPE was thrown for multiple types including Strings, Lists, Ints, and Unit.


```scala
object BugTestCase {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    doNothing("string")
  }

  def doNothing[T](code: => T): T = {
    null.asInstanceOf
  }
}
```

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at BugTestCase$.doNothing(QMBugTestCases.scala:12)
	at BugTestCase$.main(QMBugTestCases.scala:8)
	at BugTestCase.main(QMBugTestCases.scala)
```

we have fixed it by adding an type parameter to `asInstanceOf`:
```scala
  def doNothing[T](code: => T): T = {
    null.asInstanceOf[T]
  }
```

I imagine that the 2.9 code worked by assuming the type parameter on `asInstanceOf`, but that's just a guess. We would like to know if this change was intended for 2.10+?
[Type inference](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#local-type-inference) promises to infer the minimal type. That must conform to the expected type but isn't exactly that type.

When you try to handle a Nothing value, it explodes.

Inferring Nothing is especially correct in this case because the method is called doNothing.
