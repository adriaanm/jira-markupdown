A related problem:
{code}
scala> type T = B with C
defined type alias T

scala> val x : A with B = new A with T { }
<console>:7: error: class type required
       val x : A with B = new A with T { }
{code}
It seems reasonable to want to define a "premixed" version of two traits instead of having to repeat "with B with C" everywhere.
