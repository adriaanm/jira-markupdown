Fixed in r19059. I did a slightly different change (in extrapolate):
{code}
        override def mapOver(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
          case SingleType(pre, sym) =>
            if (sym.isPackageClass) tp // short path
            else {
              val pre1 = this(pre)
              if ((pre1 eq pre) || !pre1.isStable) tp
              else singleType(pre1, sym)
            }
          case _ => super.mapOver(tp)
        }
{code}
That is, if this(pre) is not stable, we back out of the extrapolation. I believe this is more predictable than doing a memberType which would lead to another existential, but at a different place.
