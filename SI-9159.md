To reproduce in REPL (I included only relevant output):
```scala
scala> import scala.tools.nsc._; import interactive.Global; import reporters._; val settings = new Settings; settings.Ylogcp.value = true; settings.usejavacp.value=false; new Global(settings, new ConsoleReporter(settings))
...
Calculated: object Calculated {
...  
  useJavaClassPath     = true
...
}
...
```

useJavaClassPath is set to true, despite having set it as false in the settings passed to Global.
The comment in the scala runner script:
```scala
# SI-8358, SI-8368 -- the default should really be false,
# but I don't want to flip the default during 2.11's RC cycle
OVERRIDE_USEJAVACP="-Dscala.usejavacp=true"
```
If you start with -Dscala.usejavacp=false, your example uses your settings.

Perhaps the other ticket means the switch will be flipped for 2.12.

But even then, should  -Dscala.usejavacp=false override settings? If an option can be set from sys property, command line, property file or programmatic default, I usually expect the first setting to win. That won't happen here.
