> I just noticed this one while researching various ways of pattern-matching URLs in Scala.  It's a pretty serious issue to me:  I will inevitably come across because pattern matching is a standout feature of Scala, and I use it a lot.  I understand that there's a workaround, however the workaround is needed after only 8 or 9 cases, which may not be the typical situation but is also not an edge case.  If the work around is to easy for the human programmer to implement, why can't the compiler just do the same thing?

What is missing are not ideas, but implementations.
