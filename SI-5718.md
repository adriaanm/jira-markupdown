{code}
abstract class Base {
  def a: Int = 1
}

class Clazz extends Base {
  def a(x: Int): Int = 2
  val z/*: Int*/ = a
}
{code}
in this code it's obviously possible to choose method 'a' from Base class. However compiler works only with Int type annotation for z.
It's also possible to choose
val z: Int=>Int = a

Base.a gets a point of relative weight because parameterless, and Clazz.a gets a point because in a derived class.  It's a tie. 

Or so I imagine.  Is there an option scalac -Yexplain-overload-resolution?

This used to list the unmatching alternatives:
{code}
abstract class Base {
  //val a: Int = 1
  def a: String = "one"
}

class Clazz extends Base {
  def a(x: Int): Int = 2
  val z: Int = a
}

overlord.scala:12: error: type mismatch;
 found   : <error>
 required: Int
  val z: Int = a
{code}
It's not an application but a value context.

If you use parens, to make it a(), it's easy to see how the disambiguation is explicit.

To answer your question, I suppose downstream errors are not considered in overload resolution; though it would be interesting if error messages could be improved to consider them.

Maybe someday:
scalac -Yexplain-overload-resolution -Ydeep-explanations
