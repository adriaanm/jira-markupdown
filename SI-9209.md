{code}type Receive = PartialFunction[Any, Unit]

val receive: Receive = { case 3 => () }{code}

gives off  {code}a type was inferred to be `Any`; this may indicate a programming error.{code}

Whilst {code}val receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = { case 3 => () }{code} does not.

To my understanding type aliaseses should be identical to raw types?
