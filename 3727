After spending all day today cozy with the inliner, I can't help but know what's up with this ticket.  What I don't know is what the intention is.  As an illustration of what the problem is and not a proposed implementation, here's a small diff which makes this test case work.
```scala
-    def lookupIMethod(meth: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Option[IMethod] =
-      icodes.icode(receiver).get lookupMethod meth
+    def lookupIMethod(meth: Symbol, receiver: Symbol): Option[IMethod] = {
+      val target = icodes.icode(receiver).get
+      
+      (target lookupMethod meth) orElse lookupIMethod(meth, target.symbol.superClass)
+    }
```
