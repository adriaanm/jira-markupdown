```scala
abstract class Bar { 
  def name : String 
}

class Baz extends { 
  var thing = ""; 
  val bar = new Bar { def name = thing }
} with AnyRef

object Main extends Application{
  val baz = new Baz;
  baz.thing = "name";
  println(baz.bar.name);
}
```

This prints " ". It should print "name".
I am afraid that's the expected behavior. It's already implied by the spec:

An early definition is type-checked and evaluated in the scope which
is in effect just before the template being defined, augmented by any
type parameters of the enclosing class and by any early definitions
preceding the one being defined. In particular, any reference to
\lstinline@this@ in the right-hand side of an early definition refers
to the identity of \lstinline@this@ just outside the template. Consequently, it
is impossible that an early definition refers to the object being
constructed by the template, or refers to one of its fields and
methods, except for any other preceding early definition in the same
section.

I have now added two more sentences, just to make it clear:

Furthermore, references to preceding early definitions
always refer to the value that's defined there, and do not take into account
overriding definitions. In other words, a block of early definitions
is evaluated exactly as if it was a local bock containing a number of value
definitions.
 
Wow. That's **really** counterintuitive. Would it be possible to have a compiler warning when a var defined in an early initialization is captured by an inner class?

Alternatively, this seems like it should be fixable so that the current value is preserved if you box the var into a reference cell like you would for a local variable captured by an inner class (you can generate the read/write methods as normal, so this shouldn't have too wide reaching effects). But that probably counts as an enhancement and needs a SIP.
