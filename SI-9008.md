That use to work on 2.11.1:

{code:scala}
trait Monad[M[_]]

def x: Monad[M forSome { type M[_] }] = ???
{code}

There seems to be an history of hate between "higher kinded" and "existential" when searching for bugs.

Is it something I should gave up on trying to use in the long term, or should I keep hope?

Would this work for you?

{code}
  type T[X] = M[X] forSome { type M[_] }
  def x2: Monad[T] = ???
  def x1: Monad[({type l[X] = M[X] forSome { type M[_]} })#l] = ???
{code}

The stricter rules are a consequence of https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/84d4671
