The spec states: "... Subclasses of a sealed class can be inherited anywhere."  So, for example:

{code}
// AB.scala
sealed trait A
trait B extends A
{code}

{code}
// CD.scala
case object C extends B
case object D extends B
{code}

This seems to defeat the purpose of {{sealed}} as a way of declaring closed algebraic types.  I can write the following:

{code}
def nonexhaustive(a: A): A = a match {
  case C => C
  // no case for D
}
{code}
I can't think of any codebase where having sealed not be transitive is used.

I would also argue that intuitively I expected it to be transitive, and I know at least a handful of people that did as well.

The only downside I see is there's no way to opt-out of being transitively sealed - such as a {{open trait B extends A}}.
How about {{sealed finally trait T}} for the desired semantics.

The example warns now, with improved match warnings.

Prog in Scala calls sealed "a license to pattern match". 

But it also says, "If you write a hierarchy of classes intended to be pattern matched, simply put sealed in front of the top of the hierarchy."

That language suggests you can pattern match anywhere in the hierarchy. (That is, arbitrary expected type for the pattern.)
