Consider allowing types more general than `Set` in a `MultiMap`.

The current definition is: `trait MultiMap[A, B] extends Map[A, Set[B]]`

An example usage: if a `ListBuffer` could be used in place of a `Set`, then the `MultiMap` could be used to associate  ordered, repeating values to the multimap key.

This request was raised and discussed on the scala-user mailing list:

  Subject: "{{MultiMap}} with a {{List}} instead of a {{Set}}?"

  http://old.nabble.com/MultiMap-with-a-List-instead-of-a-Set--to26199345.html


User suggestions include:
   * "I completely agree - I regularly use {{MultiMap}}-like functionality with {{List}} instead of {{Set}}; a generalization of it would be really useful"
   * "Could it also be generalized for any {{Seq[(A, Seq[B])]}}, not only a {{Map}} [...] it would be nice to use with a {{PriorityQueue}} for timeline based data such as an animation or MIDI sequence etc. -- this way events that occur at the same time can be added individually but dequeued together."
@adriaanm Is this still an open problem?
