Nevermind, I see you are using the undocumented -Ywarn-dead-code option.  You shouldn't really expect any reliability from -Y options.  However, this particular instance appears to have something to do with the fact that 
```scala
def x = synchronized { throw new Exception }
```
is translated into 
```scala
def x = this.synchronized[Nothing](throw new Exception)
```
Further testing reveals it doesn't really have anything to do with synchronized.  The following reports no error:
```scala
class Foo {
  def y(arg:Any) = println("foo")
  def z = this.y(throw new Exception)
}
```
while the following does:
```scala
class Foo {
  def y[T](arg:T) = println("foo")
  def z = this.y(throw new Exception)
}
```
