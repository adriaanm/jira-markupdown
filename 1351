doesn't SLS 5.2 need to be changed, then? it appears to me that the grammar does not allow this case, nor is there any discussion of it in the text.  And the text says "Class-private or object-private members may not be deferred, and may not 
have protected, final or override modÔ¨Åers."  (oh and btw there's a typo in the last word there)
