Here is the failing assertion:
```scala
      def implType(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
        case ClassInfoType(parents, decls, _) =>
          assert(phase == implClassPhase, sym)
```
I didn't save the details and I can't seem to reproduce it at a glance (possibly because I get IncompatibleClassChangeErrors before it gets to the crasher) but I didn't open this because I was playing with "$$" identifiers.  Unless we're happy with making reflection unusable, we have to deal with the class names which are reported by such methods as getClass, which are more often than not full of $$s.
```scala
scala> ((1 to 10) map (_ * 2)).getClass
res28: java.lang.Class[_ <: java.lang.Object] = class scala.collection.generic.VectorViewTemplate$$$$anon$$2
```
Also, I am fairly aghast at the casual attitude toward an outright compiler crasher.  Is the goal to build decent software or not?

OK, I will see about reproducing it.  It came up somewhere in the course of either my tab completion code or the Interpreter.breakIf pretend-debugger code, both of which rely on being able to glean information via reflection without crashing.  It was intrusive enough to cause me to shelve whichever of those I was working on... if I can't reproduce it I'm going to staple a note to my forehead which says "RECORD ALL BUG DETAILS."
