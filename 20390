This was discovered in Finagle when compiled with Scala 2.12 (see https://github.com/twitter/finagle/issues/581). Turns out some of the threads in the Netty worker pool dead-lock during the initialization with Scala 2.12.1 but work fine with 2.11.7.

I tried to simplify the reproducer as much as possible but I want to apologize for its size. It won't probably fit the Jira ticket so I created a self-contained Github repo (see https://github.com/vkostyukov/scala-2-12-1-and-runnable-bug) containing the reproducer.

Here are steps to reproduce the issue:

1) `git clone git@github.com:vkostyukov/scala-2-12-1-and-runnable-bug.git`
2) `cd scala-2-12-1-and-runnable-bug`
3) `sbt ++2.11.7 run` (program terminates)
4) `sbt ++2.12.1 run` (program never terminates)

I'm happy to provide more details if needed. My current hand-waving hypothesis is that it's somewhat a combination of (a) weirdly nested runnables used (b) during the class initialization.
