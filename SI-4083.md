= problem =

`scala.Cell` is an odd class that doesn't seem to be used anywhere.

= analysis =

I can't find a single reference to this class anywhere.  Further, it seems like a pretty useless class; `scala.Option` is better suited to holding something with `scala.Some` providing a superset of this class' functionality.

= enhancement recommendation =

Deprecate it and refer users to `scala.Option` and `scala.Some`
Neat, look how old it is.  r220.  (And earlier, but I don't have cvs records.)

Here's the r220 version.  I don't know if variance annotations existed yet.
```scala
package scala with {
  case class Cell[T](elem: T)
}
```
None of this of course is relevant to anything.
