In some cases ArrayBuilder.elems may still point to the previously created array after a call to ArrayBuilder.clear(). As a result, reusing such ArrayBuilder overwrites the contents of previously created array:

```java
  val builder = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder.ofInt
  builder ++= 1 to 16
  val array = builder.result                      //> array  : Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)
  builder.clear()
  builder += 1000
  array                                           //> res2: Array[Int] = Array(1000, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)

```

IMHO a simple fix would be to reset the field ArrayBuilder.elems on ArrayBuilder.clear() to a new array.
In #8648 comments, there's an expectation to clear and reuse, with similar results (shared state).
I think this is not just inadequate documentation.  It's a bug.  I am a little hesitant to fix it in 2.11 since it is possible that someone depended on this behavior.  It's totally safe for 2.12, and arguably buggy enough that 2.11 should have it.  I'm going to let someone else (who has to deal with the consequences of it being more problematic than anticipated) make the call of where the fix should go.  @SethTisue, do you want to call this one?

It's an easy fix.  The harder part is to decide where to put it.
Rex, can you be more explicit about your argument for considering it a bug? Sébastien's comment on the PR seems pretty persuasive to me — there's no point in fixing “bugs” like this one at a time if there is a pervasive assumption throughout mutable collections that a builder is never reusable after calling `result`
@SethTisue I suppose we could consider it a documentation bug, but it's a really pervasive documentation bug.  The problem is that some mutable builders *are* sort of reusable after calling `result`, including this very builder.  As long as you haven't filled the internal array everything works swimmingly:

```scala
scala> val a = Array.newBuilder[Int]
a: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuilder[Int] = ArrayBuilder.ofInt

scala> val b = { a += 1; a.result }
b: Array[Int] = Array(1)

scala> val c = { a.clear(); a += 2; a.result }
c: Array[Int] = Array(2)

scala> val d = b
d: Array[Int] = Array(1)
```

It's just the corner case where the builder returns an array of the right size (and thus doesn't copy) AND has been cleared and reused that we run into any trouble at all.

Unless making this work properly slows things down, I don't see much justification for the occasional disastrous behavior, even if we *do* improve the documentation to make it really clear that you'd better not reuse builders for immutable collections.

Also, that other mutable builders also give you problems if you try to do this (because they simply return themselves) is only an argument, I think, that we should document those builders very carefully.  In some cases, the API isn't even honored:

```scala
scala> val a = collection.mutable.ListBuffer.newBuilder[Int]
a: scala.collection.mutable.Builder[Int,scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int]] = scala.collection.mutable.GrowingBuilder@7de752dd

scala> { a += 1; a.clear; a += 2; a.result }
res47: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2)
```

My recommendation is to make the library as sane as possible *and* make the documentation as clear as possible regarding possible trouble spots.  Having hidden corner cases that bite you when you don't strictly adhere to a conservative reading of the docs despite apparent evidence that the desired behavior is maintained is not a nice thing to deliver to users.


Your last example is clearly a bug of `GrowingBuilder.clear()`. It should definitely call `elems.clear()` instead of doing `elems = empty`. This is ridiculous, and has nothing to do with the present discussion.

IMO, the main problem is that the documentation of `result()`, *combined with* the documentation of `clear()`, leads to the false belief that `clear()` can restore a valid state after a `result()`. If we make it clear in the documentation of `result()` that *the builder instance is invalidated after calling `result()`, and must not be further used*, then the documentation of `clear()` cannot create the false belief anymore. The false belief exists because `result()` says that "the contents of the builder are not defined", instead of "the builder instance is invalid altogether". However, it is evident from the various implementations of `Builder` that the original intent of `result()` was that the builder would be invalidated altogether.

Fixing it for mutable collections will obviously turn the {{result()}} operation from O(1) to O(n). And since {{Array}} _is_ a mutable collection, it makes no sense to fix Array but not the others. For {{Array}}, on the JVM it might not be a big deal to turn a {{private val}} into a {{private var}}, but for Scala.js this will definitely yield worse JS code, and AFAICT worse performance when the object is partially evaluated-away (which {{ArrayBuilder}} is most of the time). It will be especially bad to fix it for {{js.Array}} (whose builder is [{{js.ArrayOps}}|https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/master/library/src/main/scala/scala/scalajs/js/ArrayOps.scala]), although I guess we could recover most if not all of the perf by using a separate class for the builder, so that we can keep {{js.ArrayOps}}'s field a val.
I realize that on the JVM, `ArrayBuilder` has var fields. Some of my earlier comment might make sense only if you consider the completely different implementation of `ArrayBuilder` that is used in Scala.js: https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/master/scalalib/overrides/scala/collection/mutable/ArrayBuilder.scala#L32-L73
@sjrd I don't think it's clear at all that `Builder` is intended to be discarded after `result`, always and every time.  First, it's absolutely unnecessary for most (maybe all?--I didn't check) immutable collections.  Second, `clear` hardly makes sense as a method on a single-shot `Builder` unless you're in the habit of trying to build your collection, failing, and needing to start over again.  It looks like a standard case of a single superclass trying be an intersection type instead of a union type; we really need both a `Builder` and `ReusableBuilder`, the latter of which has the `clear` method and a guarantee that `result` followed by `clear` results in a fresh copy.

Secondly, I'm not arguing that `Builder` must always be ready for a second run on `clear`, just that when it can be made to work 100% of the time instead of 94% of the time, it should be.  And the docs should be improved at the same time.

Thirdly, the behavior of mostly-working-except-when-it-doesn't is, docs aside, a poor choice.

Now it may be the case that there's no sufficiently nonperturbative way to get out of this situation aside from changing the docs.  But I don't think we should be terribly pleased by this state of affairs, and should look for better ways to handle the situation
As I understand, the presence of mutable collections that are "Builders" for themselves is what is complicating the decision on this issue.  I feel (and not being Scala insider, I could be completely wrong) that these collections were extended with `Builder` functionality in order to fit into Scala collection framework. It is difficult to imagine someone using `ArrayBuffer` as a `Builder` to build `ArrayBuffer` directly, in library client code. In fact, I didn't even suspect that `ArrayBuffer` has `result()` method, until Sebastien pointed this out. And documentation for it ("Produces a collection (...)") is somewhat misleading for a method that just returns "this". I guess, `ArrayBuffer.result()` would ideally not be exposed publicly, as its usage scope seems to be within collection library itself (maybe there are some implications for projects like scala-js as well). But that is probably not so easy to achieve.

`ArrayBuilder`, on the other hand, has more associations with "proper" dedicated builders like `StringBuilder` and `VectorBuilder`, that are reusable after `clear()`, and that is probably the reason why I have run into this issue. And `Array` needs a dedicated builder because, unlike other mutable collections, `Array` has no means for adding a new element.

So, if we could draw a line between {{ArrayBuilder}}+{{StringBuilder}}+{{VectorBuilder}}, and the mutable collections implementing {{Builder}} trait, maybe that would make the decision easier?
`ArrayBuffer`, and other Buffers, are their own `Builder` "because they can". Builders in general are necessary for all collection types so that they fit in the `CanBuildFrom` design, and, by extension, all the normal collection methods such as `filter` or `map`. Since the `Builder` API is inherently mutable, immutable collections need separate builders, and have them. Mutable collections have abused their own class as their `Builder` s, which leads to this weird situation where `Builder` s can sometimes return `this`.

In a brand new design, I would fight for a different design where Builders and Collections would not be fused. In such a design, `Builder` would not have a `clear()` method at all. But we have to live with what we have now.

{quote}Secondly, I'm not arguing that `Builder` must always be ready for a second run on `clear`, just that when it can be made to work 100% of the time instead of 94% of the time, it should be. And the docs should be improved at the same time.{quote}

@Rex Kerr, I guess that makes sense. Under that goal, you could argue that we should fix `ArrayBuilder` for working 100% of the time, but leave other mutable collections alone (those who return `this`), and have them keep their 0%. Is that what you're getting at?
@sjrd - Yes, that's what I'm getting at, and change the docs to really clearly specify what behavior can be expected.

The only wildcard is how big of a performance benefit it would be for Scala.js.  If it's absolutely trashes JS performance for all array creations to have the 100% guarantee, well, maybe that's too great a price to pay.  I think ensured 0% is better than 94% with no warning on the 6% failures (well, not exactly 6%, really p(n = 16) + p(n = 32) + p(n = 64) + ...).

If it's just `ArrayBuilder` that needs fixing, the performance hit would be minimal, if existing at all. I did a small experiment with the fix. It produces a few more temporary variables in the JS code, but I think any decent JS VM should be able to collapse them back at this point.

@sjrd This is what I had in mind.
