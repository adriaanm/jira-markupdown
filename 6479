Oh I see, you were right that it's that override, because the superclass has logic to deal specifically with this:

      if (name.pos('.') == name.length)
        definitions.getMember(definitions.EmptyPackageClass, name.toTypeName)
      else
        definitions.getClass(name) // see tickets #2464, #3756
