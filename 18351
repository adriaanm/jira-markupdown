Scaladoc does generates invalid HTML code, as we can see e.g. here:

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scala-lang.org%2Farchives%2Fdownloads%2Fdistrib%2Ffiles%2Fnightly%2Fdocs%2Flibrary%2Fscala%2Fcollection%2Fimmutable%2FList.html&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0

(you may have to press re-validate for it to show)

This can confuse tools that actually parse the generated docs, like https://bitbucket.org/inkytonik/mkscaladocset .
