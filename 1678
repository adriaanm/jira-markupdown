The good news is that nobody has figured out the problem. But some of the relevant tickets are SI-5119, SI-5082, SI-5084. Sorry about the uninformative message. The issue is cycles between classes and their companions; there is already a lot of tension there, and ProductN pushed it over the limit between the companion object apply method, the type parameters to the ProductN parent, the synthesized copy method, the fact that the class often refers to aliases which reside in the companion object, and whatever else there is.
