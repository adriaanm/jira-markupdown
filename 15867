What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)?
```scala
$$ cat test1.scala 
trait TestA {
  class Sym[T]
  def foo: List[Sym[_]] = Nil
}

$$ cat test2.scala 
trait TestB extends TestA {
  override def foo: List[Sym[_]] = super.foo
}

$$ cat test3.scala 
trait TestC extends TestB {  
  def bar = foo
}

$$ scalac test1.scala
$$ scalac test2.scala
$$ scalac test3.scala
error: class file needed by TestB is missing.
reference type _$$1 of => List[TestA.this.Sym[_]] refers to nonexisting symbol.
one error found
```
Compiling all 3 files together works fine. Removing the super call in `TestB` also makes it work. 

What is the expected behavior? Compile without errors.

What versions of the following are you using?
