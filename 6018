(extempore in [r25467|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25467]) Don't discard deprecation/unchecked warnings regardless of settings.

Changed warnings code to accumulate them rather than thoughtlessly
discarding them and issuing its well-known taunt.  In the repl you
can take advantage of this with the :warnings command, which will show
the suppressed warnings from the last line which had any. Be advised
that at the moment it has some issues: unchecked warnings aren't
making it out, and near repl startup neither are deprecation warnings,
so don't open a bunch of tickets please.
