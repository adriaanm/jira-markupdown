Compiling 

```scala
def s = "bad escape: \z"
```

produces a compile-time error like:
```scala
error: invalid escape character
       def s = "bad escape: \z"
                             ^
```

The standard s"" and f"" string interpolators use the same escape sequences as normal double quoted strings.  Like double quoted strings the f"" interpolator reports bad sequences at compile time.

Inconsistently, the s"" string interpolator reports bad escape sequences at runtime by throwing an exception. 

For example, compiling the following code succeeds:

```scala
def f = s"bad escape: \z"
```

At run time invoking f will produce an exception:
```scala
scala.StringContext$InvalidEscapeException: invalid escape '\z' not one of [\b, \t, \n, \f, \r, \\, \", \'] at index 12 in "bad escape: \z". Use \\ for literal \.

  at scala.StringContext$.replace$1(StringContext.scala:244)

  at scala.StringContext$.treatEscapes(StringContext.scala:193)
  at scala.StringContext$$anonfun$s$1.apply(StringContext.scala:94)
  at scala.StringContext$$anonfun$s$1.apply(StringContext.scala:94)
  at scala.StringContext.standardInterpolator(StringContext.scala:122)
  at scala.StringContext.s(StringContext.scala:94)
  at .f(<console>:7)
```

I would prefer that the s"" interpolator report bad escape errors as early as possible, consistent with standard double quoted strings and f"" interpolated strings.
This would only be possible with a macro for s-interpolator. Probably there's no reason not to do that, and folks have asked for it. It would enable this issue and also trivial optimizations like `s"hello, ${"world"}"`.

Just wanted to say, once more, how I don't like spending time formatting JIRA comments.

I meant s"hello, ${"world"}" where the whole. string is a literal. Wow, it also borked that. No, I refuse to click the question mark link to research the formatting language. I have a life, too.
