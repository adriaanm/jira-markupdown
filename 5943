I am 100% against adding a new symbolic method to Any. We have enough squiggles as it is!
To treat Arrays, just use array.deep.toString. To treat null's use String.valueOf.
To treat both, you need to code it explicitely. But adding a new universal method is a huge addition to the footprint of the language. And where ## and == are indeed nicely symmetric, the analogy to the new method is much weaker, since it has nothing to do with boxed numbers. Also, note that with the new definition for equality, the symmetry between == and ## will go away.
