This problem can be a blocker when working with inner class inheritance hierarchies.

**Reproduce code**
```scala
trait A{ trait Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
val b: B = new B{}
val a: A = b
new b.Foo with a.Foo
```

**Expected result**
compiles fine

**Actual result**
```scala
error: illegal inheritance;
 <$anon: b.Foo with a.Foo> inherits different type instances of trait Foo:
a.Foo and b.Foo
              new b.Foo with a.Foo
                  ^
```

Note that this happens even if the inner child class does not have the same name as the inner parent, but this fact forces having to upcast to B in order to access the inner parent.

In Slick it prevents an external user to us RelationalProfile's SimpleQL class with JdbcProfile's Implicits class.
What you are asking for is unsound. Here's why:

```scala
class Box[A](var value: A)
class A { class Foo extends Box[A.this.type](A.this) }
class B extends A { class Bar extends Foo }
object Test extends App {
  val b: B = new B
  val a: A = new A // you wrote `b` here, but I changed to `new A` so as to demonstrate the unsoundness that this restriction prevents.
  val mix: b.Bar with a.Foo = new b.Bar().asInstanceOf[b.Bar with a.Foo] // new b.Bar with a.Foo {}
  (mix: b.Bar).value = b
  val a1: a.type = (mix: a.Foo).value
  assert(a1 == a) // fails
}
```
@retronym Ah right. `val a: A = b` looses the path-information about the specific b.

Ok, then back to the original question that got me here: If I have a specific b, how can I access it's A-parent's Foo class, in case it is shadowed by it's B-parent's Foo class like in my original example?
How about:

```scala
trait A{ trait Foo; type FooA = Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
```

Generally I would recommend against defining an inner classes with the same name as one in a parent. Use type aliases instead, in the style of scala-reflect. Following that discipline avoids unsoundness traps like #6161.

What if you are not writing the classes? You just find them in a library and can't change their code. I am trying to write an external extension for Slick 2.1. We could change the shadowing for Slick 2.2, but 2.1 is shipped.

I'm still not quite following the motivation.

In your original code:

```scala
trait A{ trait Foo }
trait B extends A{ trait Foo extends super.Foo }
val b: B = new B{}
val a: A = b
new b.Foo with a.Foo
```

Why didn't you just write:

```scala
new b.Foo
```

given that `B#Foo` already extends `A#Foo`?
IIUC, the only approach you could try would be to use more inheritance:

```scala
trait A{ trait Foo }
trait B extends A {
  trait Foo extends super.Foo { def xxx = 0 }
}

// extension
trait C extends B with A {
  type AFoo = super[A].Foo
}

object Test extends App {
  val c = new C {}
  val afoo = new c.AFoo {}
  afoo.xxx // does not compile
}
```
