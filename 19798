Package focus breaks classes list view in Scaladoc.

Steps to reproduce:
- Go to the Scaladoc [page](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/)
- Type "Future" in the class search field
- Click on "Future" to open its documentation
- Click "focus" for `scala.concurrent` package
- Clear class search field
# Cancel package focus - click (x) near "focused on {{scala.concurrent}}"

Although you should have all classes/traits/objects visible on the list on the left, only some of them are visible.
