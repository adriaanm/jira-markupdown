Please change the scaladoc 2 guidelines to match the indenting and spacing convention to date.

The current scaladoc 2 guidelines posted here [[https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/Scaladoc/AuthorDocs]] recommend format like this:
```scala
/** Start the comment here
  * two spaces before the asterisk on following lines
  * and the last line ending at the end like this */
```

The source code of Scala, even the very latest changes which include scaladoc 2 specific tags (e.g. [[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/rc/index.html#scala.collection.parallel.ParIterable]]) use the long-standing Java convention of:
```scala
/**
 * First line has no comment on it (except for one line comments)
 * following lines have one space before the asterisk.
 * The last line just ends the comment and lines up the asterisks.
 */
```

This long standing convention has (until recently) been enabled by the standard IDEs. (This patch to the Scala IntelliJ plugin changed this [[http://git.jetbrains.org/?p=idea/scala-plugin.git;a=commit;h=35656665c79c6fb43a46048e3bd16370f33286b0]]).

The very helpful Scala Style Guide [[http://davetron5000.github.com/scala-style/scaladoc/index.html]] also recommends this long standing convention.

There seems to be no reason (other than the fact that some people prefer the new convention) for changing the convention that is long established.  Changes like this cause ridiculous and time wasting arguments in development teams who have to decide to stick with the old or go with the new and then win over everyone involved.  Scaladoc 2 does not require this change to work.

Please can we change the Scaladoc 2 guidelines to match the standard practice.
Sorry, but your response is not at all clear.

You appear to be saying that you think the recommended here [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/Scaladoc/AuthorDocs] style should stay as it is even though it is in conflict with the source of the scala library and in conflict with the scala style guide and Java coding conventions for the last n years.

You appear to be saying that you think it should stay because "it is much easier to get the formatting right", but you don't qualify that with any explanation of why you think it is much easier.  In most cases it is human nature to find the status-quo to be easiest to get right.

You say that the old style was a constant hassle to you, and behaves inconsistently and non-obviously to you, but it is no hassle to me and entirely obvious to me.  So I think you are effectively saying that the new style is your personal preference.

My argument is not about personal preference, it is about maintaining consistency and not changing things that don't have to be changed because changing things wastes unnecessarily time and effort if it does not bring with it some clear benefit.

Your final comment seems to be saying that you are proposing patching the entire Scala library comments to change to the 'new style'.  Why?
