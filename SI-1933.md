I'm running Eclipse 3.4.1 (M20080911-1700) on debian.

I followed directions on http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94.

I have Scala Plugin (and associated) 2.7.4.final.

When I get to creating the HelloWorld class from "New class", that window does not dissappear when I click "Finish".  When I click Cancel, the following code is in HelloWorld.scala:

package hello

class HelloWorld {

}

However, as I type, this error comes up repeatedly:

Error notifying a preference change listener. Check the log for details.
lampion.eclipse.Editor$$$$anon$$1 cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor$$AdaptedSourceViewer

When I add "extends Application", the keyword "HelloWorld" is redlined saying "HelloWorld is already defined as class HelloWorld" and all but the last letter of "Application" is redlined, and hovering over it shows a blank error message window.

If I close and open the project, as soon as I double-click on HelloWorld.scala, I get the same error. I think it pops up twice.
