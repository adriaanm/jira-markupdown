Scala 2.11.x for a function:
```scala
def isWrapper(is: FileInputStream): InputStream = {
  val pb = new PushbackInputStream(is, 2)
  val signature = new Array[Byte](2)
  pb.read(signature)
  pb.unread(signature)
  if (signature.sameElements(Array(0x1F, 0x8B))) {
    new GZIPInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(pb))
  } else {
    pb
  }
}
```

reports: a type was inferred to be `AnyVal`; this may indicate a programming error.
```scala
def isWrapper(is: FileInputStream): InputStream = {
                                               ^
```


Although an compilation problem corresponds to: signature.sameElements(Array(0x1F, 0x8B)) where second array is Array[Int] and not Array[Byte].
