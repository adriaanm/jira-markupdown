I suggest we simply close as "not a bug". everything here is working as designed. {{return}} does a non-local exit from the enclosing method, full stop. normal Scala code doesn't use {{return}} at all, anyway.

there are things in here that could be separate tickets and/or PR improvements. perhaps someone reading this will be motivated to create those tickets and/or PRs, even if the original reporter wasn't.
