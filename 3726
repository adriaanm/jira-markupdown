This makes the debugging output pretty confusing, though it won't help much as it turns out:
{code}
"\n\tconcreteMethod.isEffectivelyFinal: " + concreteMethod.isFinal
{code}
Fixing that it still says false, because Base is the symbol's owner.

BTW this does make it inline:
{code}
  override def foo(n: Int) = super.foo(n)
{code}
Does seem like it should behave the same with or without that override.
