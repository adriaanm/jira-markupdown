This makes the debugging output pretty confusing, though it won't help much as it turns out:
```scala
"\n\tconcreteMethod.isEffectivelyFinal: " + concreteMethod.isFinal
```
Fixing that it still says false, because Base is the symbol's owner.

BTW this does make it inline:
```scala
  override def foo(n: Int) = super.foo(n)
```
Does seem like it should behave the same with or without that override.
