I am facing a problem with annotations in 2.8. I have a class as :

@BeanInfo case class Book(title: String, @Foo(value = "ISBN") isbn: String)

The problem that I was facing is that the annotation was not being made 
available on the getter method. However it was on the field level. 
I made the following change in 2.8 :

@BeanInfo case class Book(title: String, 
  @Foo(value = "ISBN") @beanGetter isbn: String)

I expected that the annotation will be available on the getter now .. 
But when I do an introspection and check getDeclaredAnnotations on the read 
method, I don't get the annotation.

things work perfectly in 2.7.7 without the @beanGetter.
