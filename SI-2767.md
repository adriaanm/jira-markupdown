To reproduce, please install Scala plugin and subclipse plugin and import the source code from https://asn1gen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/asn1gen as an eclipse project.

Then open the file asn1gen/src/org.asn1gen.parsing.asn1.Asn1ParserBase.scala

Here, I get a lot of "not found" and "not a member" errors.

This is despite the fact that whole project builds fine and the corresponding unit tests at https://asn1gen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/asn1gentest all pass.
Which version of the plug-in are you using?

If you are using 2.7.x, is this bug the same as SI-1277?


I just did a svn checkout of you project and I see no errors in the file Asn1ParserBase.scala. Do those errors appear after a Clean and auto-build? If this is the case then this is probably a duplicate of SI-2689.

BTW thank you for you interest in improving SDT by submitting a bug report. Bug reports are always helpful, but they are more helpful if they provide a specific way to reproduce the bug using a small self-contained code example. For example see SI-2689, the code provided is minimal and has no dependencies so the developers can easily see the problem or use the provided code in a test case.

It would be extremely helpful, if this bug is not a duplicate of SI-2689, if you could find the smallest example that reproduces the misbehavior that you have observed.

Hi Miles,

any compiler related fix is more than welcome, I am looking forward to test the next nightly.

Replying to [comment:15 milessabin]:
> SI-2889 is now fixed, so I'd be grateful for another review of this ticket ... unfortunately I'm not expecting this one to be fixed.

Hi Miles,

the below code gives a bogus error message in the Scala editor: 
{code}
package test

import javax.persistence._

class User {

  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  var lastLogin: java.util.Date = _

}
{code}

The message is: "annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: TemporalType{<null>}.TIMESTAMP{<null>}" and I believe that it happens because the Scala compiler believes that Java Enums are not valid values for annotation arguments (TemportalType is a Java Enum).

Sorry for the external dependency to JPA but this does not work if the annotation and the enum are defined in the same project as the User class (maybe due to a compiler bug, I'll file another bug report).
Unless I'm very much mistaken, that example is a dupe of SI-2764 which is actually a compiler bug.
Thanks for the heads up! I was just writing a duplicate bug report of SI-2764.

If the Java annotation, Java enum and the Scala class are in the same project then we get the compiler bug and Eclipse correctly reports this error in both the editor and the problems view (Eclipse does not know that the compiler has a bug).

In the case that I wrote in my comment the code compiles and runs so the error is bogus since compilation completed successfully. The problem with Eclipse here is that an error that produced during compilation and was later (during compilation) removed is shown in the Scala editor. 
From SI-2764 "it works when compiling against the compiled java files" which is the case in my submitted example (since the annotation and the enum are in the JPA jar).
I think I'm still not fully understanding your comment 21. How does the IDE's behaviour differ from what you'd expect, given that SI-2764 isn't yet fixed?
*On bug SI-2764*

The creator of the bug said that the attached Scala file (which is the same as the example that I used in my comment) produces a compilation error but the code runs (so it compiles). I believe that he was seeing a bogus message (not reported in the Problems View). The message must be bogus since the he said that the code runs. If we get a compilation error we cannot run the code.

Then when you tried to minimize the dependencies of the example code you found the real bug with the code that you wrote in your first comment. In this comment the annotation, enum and Scala class are defined (and hence compiled) in the same project so the compiler bug get triggered (Eclipse here correctly reports the compilation error which is result of the bug since it does not know that the compiler has a bug). In this case you cannot run the code and hence the compilation error in valid (although the result of a compiler bug).

I expect the code that uses the JPA annotations not to produce any errors because as rytz said in a later comment of SI-2764 "it works when compiling against the compiled java files" which is the case with JPA since the annotation and the enum are compiled in the JPA jar. Also when we compile from the command line we do not get any compiler messages.
Because the errors shown in the editor are produced by the presentation compiler (which uses source if available, tripping SI-2764) whereas the errors shown in Problems view are produced by the build compiler (which only uses binaries in this case, avoiding SI-2764).
OK understood, but as I've said in an earlier comment I get the same behavior in a project that does not have the JPA sources attached. How does SI-2767 gets triggered by the presentation compiler in this case?
Replying to [comment:42 milessabin]:
> Do you have Project => Build Automatically enabled? If not, could you enable it and let me know if that reduces the number of bogus errors you're seeing.

When this bug was first opened the only way to trigger it was to do clean with a subsequent build. Also the bogus errors wouldn't go away with any form of compilation. You needed to close and reopen your projects (and sometimes even then they persisted) in order to have them removed.

During the last couple of weeks things have changed and we also get bogus error messages after incremental compilation (via save). Those error messages disappear after an incremental compilation and they appear again after a clean&build or they might appear again after an incremental build.

For example in a non trivial project we might have a file called exceptions.scala that has the !BadInputException defined. When in another file we use the !BadInputException and save it to compile we will get a bogus error messages saying: "not found: type !BadInputException". If we edit that file and save it again the bogus error message will disappear. Subsequent incremental recompilations of that file might trigger the bug again and make the bogus error message appear but this does not happen 100% of the time. What always triggers this bug is a Clean&Build, if we do a Clean&Build the bogus error message always appears.

Thanks, but that doesn't answer my question ;-)

I suspect that the fix for SI-2931 will have improved the situation for this ticket as well, but there are still likely to be issues in the presentation compiler with types which are contained in source files which aren't named for the type.

If automatic building is enabled, then the class file generated for such a type will provide a reference back to the source file it was built from irrespective of the source file name. But if there's no class file there's no way (currently) for the presentation compiler to locate the source file for a given type (unless it already knows about it because that type's source file is open in an editor).

Hopefully that gives you some context for my previous request ...

> I am not aware of scaladoc problems, but the stability issue has been fixed by Martin just now (by "stability", I the test.stability ant target).

Sorry my mistake :-(

I quickly saw the console output from hudson and thought it was a scaladoc problem. Good to know that the problem is fixed.

I now have a minimal reproducer ...

A.scala
{code}
object Misnamed
{code}

B.scala
{code}
object B {
  val a = Misnamed
} 
{code}

If at least one of,
 * A.scala is open in an editor
or,
 * There is a class file for object Misnamed
Then the editor will (correctly) not report errors against the occurrence of Misnamed in B.scala. If both of these conditions do not hold (ie. close A.scala, turn off automatic building, then do a clean without an immediate rebuild) then the editor will (incorrectly) report "not found: value Misnamed" against the occurrence of Misnamed in B.scala.

Note that in the both the error and the non-error case the presentation compiler might need a little nudge to exhibit the behaviour as described (e.g to make the incorrect error go away by opening A.scala you might also need to make a single character edit to B.scala; to make the error reappear you might need to reinstantiate the presentation compiler by doing a clean).

I think that this example probably covers all the remaining cases of this ticket, so if you're seeing incorrect behaviour which is clearly different from the incorrect behaviour I've just described, then please let me know.
BTW the bug SI-2710 might be related to this bug.
You are right, I didn't mean to imply that there in a common underlining cause for the two bugs. My reasoning is that since they both happen after a clean and since (if I am correct) the task items are added by the presentation compiler there might be various inconsistencies that happen in the state of the presentation compiler after a clean operation.

Related in my previous comment meant that the fix for SI-2710 and the fix this bug might be in the same area so SI-2710 might be a good bug to tackle after this one.
I am obviously wrong, sorry for the noise.


I am using r20847 and I still see spurious errors :-(

From my testing so far the errors are greatly reduced but they still exist. At first I thought that the errors were only for packages and package objects but I also saw an error for an object. I will investigate this further and try to report specific ways to reproduce.

All the errors are for Scala top level elements that are defined in files that do not correspond to their qualified names that is why I reopen this issue instead of a new one.
