Sean, I've marked this ticket as due for 2.10.1-RC1 to hopefully get new attention to it. But I'd recommend to submit a pull request, it seems this time it's going to be accepted. But you (somebody) needs to:
* add some test case (you have a minimal one, if that fails now that's good)
* possibly, check other variations of the same bug (like reduceRight). And what about LinearSeqOptimized.fold/reduceRight? I see your point on not touching Stream, but LinearSeqOptimized is implemented by other classes, so it should also be addressed.
If some broken use cases are left, please comment on SI-6922 so that they're documented.
