Here's a (artificial but very similar to the actual) scenario: How would you debug this stacktrace from a log?
```scala
Caused by: akka.pattern.AskTimeoutException: Ask timed out on [Actor[akka://default/user/handler]] after [500 ms]
 	at akka.pattern.PromiseActorRef$$anonfun$1.apply$mcV$sp(AskSupport.scala:333)
 	at akka.actor.Scheduler$$anon$7.run(Scheduler.scala:117)
 	at scala.concurrent.Future$InternalCallbackExecutor$.unbatchedExecute(Future.scala:599)
 	at scala.concurrent.BatchingExecutor$class.execute(BatchingExecutor.scala:109)
 	at scala.concurrent.Future$InternalCallbackExecutor$.execute(Future.scala:597)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$TaskHolder.executeTask(Scheduler.scala:467)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$$anon$8.executeBucket$1(Scheduler.scala:419)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$$anon$8.nextTick(Scheduler.scala:423)
 	at akka.actor.LightArrayRevolverScheduler$$anon$8.run(Scheduler.scala:375)
 	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)
```

My code doesn't use the ask pattern and my code doesn't use Await (but of course, any third party code I depend on may, I don't know). It only happens on production where I cannot attach a debugger. 

If `Failure.get` would provide a proper stacktrace finding the problem may have been very simple. Or at least working around it, as it would show where the problem is raised in my own code.
