I guess yes, since as per Collection [api|http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.package]

{quote}
It is convenient to treat all collections as either a scala.collection.Traversable or scala.collection.Iterable, as these traits define the vast majority of operations on a collection.

Where {{Traversable}} is [extends|http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.Traversable] {{GenTraversable}}.

Would {{`$Coll`}} would update as per the current API someone is looking. For example, in case of List, List will be shown but in case of Set, Set will be displayed?

Please let me know if this understanding is correct, I would try to make the change and send out the pull request?

Also, is there a way to validate by generating documentation locally? Your help is very much appreciated.
