Java arrays can be passed to ObjectOutputStream, and objects that can be serialized are meant to be marked with Serializable.

They aren't in java because they are a weird primitive, but in Scala they can be. This is useful if you parameterise a class:
```scala
Foo[T <: java.io.Serializable]
```

You can then write:
```scala
Foo[Array[Bar]]
```
