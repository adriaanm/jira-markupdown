Frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null) doesn't work. To center on the screen you have to write frame.peer.setLocationRelativeTo(null), because it automatically passes c.peer, but the peer implementation allows null to indicate centering on the screen.
Do you still want me to attach source code?
I'm attaching my program (if anyone wants to use it, enjoy it).
The line in question is line 43. Instead of reading
peer.setLocationRelativeTo(null)
'peer.' should be omitted.

This would be implemented by changing line 36 in class scala.swing.Frame from
  def setLocationRelativeTo(c: UIElement) { peer.setLocationRelativeTo(c.peer) }
to
... {peer.setLocationRelativeTo(c match {case null=>null; case _=>c.peer}) }

or better yet, to support passing any peer directly,
... {peer.setLocationRelativeTo(c match {case e:UIElement=>e.peer; case _=>c}) }
etc.
Thanks!
