[~retronym] Are we sure that we _want_ to fix this?  Maps and sets are particularly vulnerable to very poor behavior if the wrong collection type is chosen; unless you're basically positive that the set is small, you're better off with a variant of {{HashSet}} than anything else.  There are no notes that I can see that explains why {{GenTraversableFactory}} uses a different approach than {{GenSetFactory}}--one defers to {{genericBuilder}} while the other calls {{newBuilder}}.  Maybe it's just a mistake.  But one could also argue that if you really _want_ a linear hash map, your types should reflect that.

One could also argue this for e.g. {{Seq}}, but there the argument is weaker given that the core computation that a set does is {{contains}}, which becomes {{O(n)}}, while indexing via {{apply}} is just one of a number of {{Seq}} goodies.  Plus, with {{Seq}} you can insist on {{IndexedSeqOptimized}} if you want good indexing.
