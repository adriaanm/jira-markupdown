I have [http://github.com/dcsobral/scala/commit/3fd85f6f52e5f5685ce22cb5cbbfd5d406a107f4 committed] a simple fix on github that relies on `dropWhile`, `takeWhile`, `foldLeft` and `update` to produce a new range.

The performance shouldn't be particularly bad, though it does create a whole new tree instead of taking advantage of existing elements of the existing tree. Still, this ought to be better than the broken implementation presently available.

It is still my intention to pursue a superior fix, but I lost the window to 2.8.1 already, so I'd prefer to have this fix in.
