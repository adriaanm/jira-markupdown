It has something to do with unapply's when mixed with nested objects.  The following code generates the same error with the stand-alone compiler:
{code}
object A1 {
 object A2 {
   class X { def unapply(v : Int) = Some(v + 1) }
 }
}

object B1 {
  object B2 {
    val q = new A1.A2.X
  }
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    import B1.B2.q
    val res = 5 match { case q(x) => x }
    println(res)
  }
}
{code}

I have committed a test case at `test/pending/run/bugtr0005.scala`.

I don't know who should be assigned pattern-matching bugs right now. Burak, is it you still, or should it be passed to someone else or to devteam?
