```scala
Array(1, 2, 3).par.groupBy(_ > 0)
```

yields:
```scala
scala> Array(1, 2, 3, 4).par.groupBy(_ > 0)
res0: scala.collection.parallel.immutable.ParMap[Boolean,scala.collection.parallel.mutable.ParArray[Int]] = ParMap(true -> ResizableParArrayCombiner(4): )
```

Previously this was not being noticed due to a bug in Partest where ScalaCheck tests would fail without failing the partest suite.
