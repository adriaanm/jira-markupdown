If I annotate a class in scala, using a annotation defined in java with RetentionPolicy.CLASS, the annotation is retained at runtime.

Here's a typical example using Peter Kriens' annotations for OSGi:
{code}
@aQute.bnd.annotation.component.Component class MyComp
{code}

If I launch the REPL with my class in the classpath, but without the definition of the annotation, and I simply try to instantiate the class, I get the following error:
{code}
scala> val c = new MyComp
error: error while loading MyComp, Missing dependency 'class aQute.bnd.annotation.component.Component', required by ./MyComp.class
<console>:5: error: MyComp does not have a constructor
       val c = new MyComp
{code}

And if I use Peter Kriens' class dump utility, it shows the following information:
{code}
2: attribute                   RuntimeVisibleAnnotations(#16)
2: Number of annotations       2
2: type                        LaQute/bnd/annotation/component/Component;(#12)2: num_element_value_pairs     0
2: type                        Lscala/reflect/ScalaSignature;(#13)2: num_element_value_pairs     1
{code}

This is very problematic in an OSGi environment where the package should not even need to be imported.
