I'm trying to build Scala 2.10.x, however I encounter few problems. One is related to Arch Linux devtools - when nobody's $HOME points to /, build fails due to no permissions to create .m2 directory. Additionally build system ignores HOME variable, so I had to replace ${user.home} with /tmp. However I didn't help much -- see build log in the attachments.
Hi Bart≈Çomiej,

Did you try to specify [localRepository](http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks/reference.html#localRepository) ?

Also, demoting it to Minor. Problems with building on non-standard machine configurations have low priority.
