Let's go through what happens when you write Array(1, 2, 3).

First the compiler creates an Array[Int] of size three. Then it populates it. So now we have the desired Array[Int].

Now it boxes it into a BoxedIntArray. The BoxedIntArray is passed to Array.apply. A new Array[Int] of size 3 is created. The BoxedIntArray's elements method is called. The iterator's foreach method is then called to populate the new Array[Int]. The new Array[Int] is then returned.

This could, um, benefit from skipping a few steps. e.g. everything from Array.apply onwards.

(Yes I know you still need the Array.apply methods for when passing a Seq to Array.apply, but in the case where the arguments are known at compile time this seems a bit ridiculous)
This is essentially a dupe of SI-925.
