This is reverted in r18540 because the logic breaks down (in a heisenbug inducing way) in the face of package objects.  Name mangling is too complicated and this patch was sketchy anyway, we shouldn't be trying to determine fundamental characteristics of internals by examining a String which is manipulated in several different ways and a dozen different places.

For future reference, while this patch was applied, given the following two command lines, one would crash and one would work fine.
```scala
% scalac scala/collection/immutable/List.scala scala/concurrent/pilib.scala
% scalac scala/concurrent/pilib.scala scala/collection/immutable/List.scala
```
