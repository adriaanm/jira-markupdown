At page 106 (in the Iterators chapter), I found another possible issue 
{code:language=scala}
    fromArray(xs)
      .zip(from(0))
      .filter ( case (x, i) => x > limit )
      .map ( case (x, i) => i )
```scala

which fails to compile in Scala 2.11 

I found the solution on how to change the code on the following web resource :
http://java.dzone.com/articles/scala-pattern-matching-pair

??dwins: scala requires that “case” statements be inside curly braces. 
The code should look like  this : 

{code:language=scala}
    fromArray(xs)
      .zip(from(0))
      .filter { case (x, i) => x > limit }
      .map { case (x, i) => i }
```
