I use this feature *constantly* in the Java IDE, and have felt somewhat handicapped without it in Scala.

In a Scala editor, what it seems to do is still call the Java-source version (does that make it a defect?)  It will still pull in imports to the extent that your Scala code may also resemble valid Java. 

class Foo extends Group { val x = new Color()  } // two imports
class Foo(val y: Int) extends Group { val x = new Color() } // one import
class Foo(val y: Int) extends Group { val x = new Color }   // no imports

It would be great if it were not a pain to reuse some of the existing mechanism, while updating to recognize types in Scala syntax...
