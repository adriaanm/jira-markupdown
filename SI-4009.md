What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)?
```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> 1+2
res0: Int = 12
```

What is the expected behavior?

According to *Programming in Scala*, this should produce 3, not 12. It looks like + is appending, not adding, although the result still winds up being an Int.

What do you see instead?

12

What versions of the following are you using?
Scala: 2.8.1.final
Java: 1.6.0_20
Operating system: CYGWIN_NT-6.0-WOW64 shiny 1.7.7(0.230/5/3) 2010-08-31 9:58 i686 Cygwin

(Cygwin on Windows Vista SP1)
This is the kind of report where it's easy to say "no way" and indeed:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> 1+2
res0: Int = 3
```
I can hazard a guess.  Somewhere in the windows maze, some piece of software is helpfully trying to give you a "better looking one" (like "smart quotes") and changing it from an old fashioned ascii 1 to some fancy unicode one.  Though I can't even guess how it is turned back into an Int.

No way to do anything with this without more info to pin the blame.
Don't blame the messenger!

Hmm, I bet this is related to Scala's issues with the mintty Cygwin interface, described here:

In Scala's bugtracker, this is ticket 2097:

http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/2097

When I hit my original problem, I was running this slightly modified Cygwin.bat to make emacs happy:

```scala
@echo off

C:
chdir C:\cygwin\bin

set CYGWIN=tty notitle glob
bash --login -i
```

If I comment out the `set` line, the problem goes away.

Or, if I leave the `set` line in, I can apply the fix given in the links above, i.e. add this to the last line in bin/scala:

```scala
-Djline.terminal=jline.UnixTerminal
```

Either workaround gives me 3, not 12.

Sadly, both approaches cause interactive scala to start with this unsightly stack trace (then continue unfazed):

Oh, by the way:

```scala
$$ which sh
/usr/bin/sh
```

I take the sh stack trace to be incidental to the main problem here, which is that the tty library scala uses has trouble on Cygwin. But the stack trace makes the workaround rather alarming.

Hmm, I realized that last was a little funny:

```scala
$$ which -a sh
/usr/bin/sh
/bin/sh

$$ ls -l /bin/sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 Paul A Jungwirth None 13 2010-10-09 12:20 /bin/sh -> /usr/bin/bash
```
