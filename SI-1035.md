def foo(p:Any) = p match {
      case B(n)    => println("B") 
      case A(n)    => println("A")    
}

will produce a crash of scalac. A, B are objects extractors of classes A and B. Here B inherits of A. If we switch the cases the problem disappears:

def foo(p:Any) = p match {
      case A(n)    => println("A")
      case B(n)    => println("B") 
          
}
This also happens with the simpler example
```scala
  case class Foo(x : Int)
  case class Bar(y : Int) extends Foo(y)

  (Bar : AnyRef) match {
    case Bar(x) => 0
    case Foo(x) => 1
  }
```
I should note that the key seems to be the extraction.  The original example doesn't even use case classes, but extractors.  And if I simplify my example even further to
```scala
  case class Foo
  case class Bar extends Foo

  (Bar : AnyRef) match {
    case Bar() => 0
    case Foo() => 1
  }
```
the crash goes away.
