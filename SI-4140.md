Adding a parametrized type constraint 
{{ [T <% Serializable] }} causes the object in
question NOT to be serializable. What irony.
{code}
trait IData[T] with java.io.Serializable {
    def getObject: T
}


@SerialVersionUID(1L)
class Data[T <% Serializable](obj: T) extends IData[T] {
    def getObject: obj
}

private final scala.Function1 Data.evidence$$1                          
  [class=scala.Predef$$$$anon$$3] [----- field that is not serializable
                
javap -private Data
public class Data extends java.lang.Object 
    implements IData,scala.ScalaObject{
  public static final long serialVersionUID;
  private final scala.Function1 evidence$$1;
  private java.lang.Object obj;
.....
}

[emberson@olympia scala]$$ javap 'Predef$$$$anon$$3'
Compiled from "Predef.scala"
public final class scala.Predef$$$$anon$$3 
    extends scala.Predef$$$$less$$colon$$less{
  public java.lang.Object apply(java.lang.Object);

{code} 
Function1 is not Serializable



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Well, the constraint for Serializability would not
prevent the object from being serialized.


=== What do you see instead? ===

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:2.9.0.r23924-b20110107123601
  - Java:1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Linux
Apologies
{code}
import java.io.Serializable

trait IData[T] extends Serializable {
  def getObject: T
  def setObject(obj: T): Unit
}

@SerialVersionUID(1L)
class Data[T <% Serializable](_obj: T) extends IData[T] {

  def this() = this(null.asInstanceOf[T])

  private var obj: T = null.asInstanceOf[T]

  if (! _obj.isInstanceOf[Serializable]) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Foo")
  }

  if (_obj != null) setObject(_obj)

  def getObject: T = obj

  def setObject(obj: T): Unit = {
    this.obj = obj
  }
}
{code}
But its academic. I went back to my own code (100Kloc)
and put back the type constraint, and javap no longer
had {{ private final scala.Function1 evidence$$1; }}.
I tried some combinations, trying to remember any 
changes made during the day, but could not get it to
generate a field for the evidence.
Sorry. But I certainly did not make it up. I am sorry
to admit that I do no know Scala well enough to 
make up the evidence field and or the 
{code}
[class=scala.Predef$$$$anon$$3] [----- field that is not serializable
{code}
warning message.

Close the bug report.

I don't doubt you didn't make it up, but I couldn't tell what you were doing which would bring it about.

The field will come to be if a conversion from T => Serializable is required outside of the primary constructor.  For example, add this method and you'll see the field, because it can't "forget" how it is that Ts becomes Serializables.
{code}
  def obj_s: Serializable = obj
{code}
If I don't find a reason I shouldn't or can't, I'll make <:< (or you've known it, "scala.Predef$$$$anon3") and =:= serializable.

(In r23956) Made <:< and =:= serializable.  Closes SI-4140, review by moors.
