The actors migration guide was based on the 'MigrationSystem' object from Akka. This object has been removed from Akka and this renders the Actor Migration Kit useless. 

The following things need to be changed:
  - MigrationSystem needs to be removed from Scala
  - Replacement from Akka needs to be added to scala
  - All test cases starting with "actmig" need to be modified to use the replacement
  - All the examples in the actor migration guide need to be modified to the new abstraction
  - There needs to be a paragraph about how to configure Akka actor systems to work after the migration 
Pull request #1425 removes the `MigrationSystem` and adds an `ActorDSL` object which also exists in Akka. The pull request also fixes all the "actmig" test cases to use `ActorDSL`.

The actor migration guide updates are *not* part of this issue. They should happen independently from this bug fix, as explained by Josh Suereth. As a result the pending migration guide update will not block the staging of the Scala 2.10.0 distribution. Instead, they will be handled in the same way as other pending updates to docs.scala-lang.org.
