I believe that you are breaking the contract of `sortWith` by using `>=` rather than `>`.
```scala
 * lt  the comparison function which tests whether        
 *   its first argument precedes its second argument in 
 *   the desired ordering.     
 */
def sortWith(lt: (A, A) => Boolean): Repr = sorted(Ordering fromLessThan lt)                         
```
