If you throw an exception in a lazy val, you should always get the same exception.  The following example illustrates the current behavior which shows that distinct exceptions are created on every access:
{code}
object Test extends Application {
  lazy val x : String = throw new Error("error")

  def hold[T <: AnyRef](arg: => T) : AnyRef = 
   try { arg } catch { case e => e }

  val e1 = hold(x)
  val e2 = hold(x)

  println(e1 eq e2)
}
{code}
Is this an issue in practice?  I would hate to see lazy vals become even more expensive unless it's really necessary.
