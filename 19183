This should be an easy one. Who wants an easy one?
```scala
scala> import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

scala> Duration.Zero - Duration.Inf
res0: scala.concurrent.duration.Duration = Duration.Inf

scala> Duration.Zero - Duration.MinusInf
res1: scala.concurrent.duration.Duration = Duration.MinusInf
```

Surely someone forgot a minus sign in the wildcard case of `FiniteDuration.-(other: Duration)`, right?
