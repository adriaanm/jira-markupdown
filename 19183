This should be an easy one. Who wants an easy one?

{code}
scala> import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.duration._

scala> Duration.Zero - Duration.Inf
res0: scala.concurrent.duration.Duration = Duration.Inf

scala> Duration.Zero - Duration.MinusInf
res1: scala.concurrent.duration.Duration = Duration.MinusInf
{code}

Surely someone forgot a minus sign in the wildcard case of {{FiniteDuration.-(other: Duration)}}, right?
