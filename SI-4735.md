"scalac -help" with respect to "-g" reports the following: 
  -g:<level>
scalac barfs simply because "-g" has no ":<level>"
 
"javac -help" reports:
  -g                         Generate all debugging info
  -g:none                    Generate no debugging info
  -g:{lines,vars,source}     Generate only some debugging info

scalac's behavior on this seems stupid. Why not just have a default for the lone "-g"? And it breaks buildr which assumes said "-g" when compiling. Why change something as trivial as this especially when 2.8.x worked this way.
