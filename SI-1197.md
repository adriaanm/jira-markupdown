the following transcript shows that it works if you use javac first followed by scalac, but not if you pass both files to scalac.

this is a pretty minor bug since it's pretty easy to work around by adding a redundant "static" declaration (change "interface" to "static interface")

{code}
  ~/newbug> cat J.java 
class J { interface K { } }

  ~/newbug> cat S.scala 
object S extends J.K

  ~/newbug> javac J.java
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac S.scala       
  ~/newbug> rm *.class
  ~/newbug> ~/scala/dists/latest/bin/scalac J.java S.scala
S.scala:1: error: not found: value J
object S extends J.K
                 ^
one error found
{code}
