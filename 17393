DocType's documentation claims:

 *  @param  extID  None, or Some(external ID of this doctype)

but its constructor begs to differ:

  case class DocType(name: String, extID: ExternalID, intSubset: Seq[dtd.Decl])

The documentation is correct, in that the ExternalID should be optional. A patch is attached that makes the class conform to its documentation and provides a deprecated, backwards compatible constructor and apply method, as well as an additional "convenience" apply method which allows one to construct DocType("html") which is all one should have to do if they intend only to support modern web browsers.
