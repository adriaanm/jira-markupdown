There seem to be a regression in handling transient lazy vals in 2.12. In 2.11.8, the backing field seems to be marked as transient, while in 2.12.0 it doesn't seem to. (Full example: https://gist.github.com/durban/8c2ffdc426b89fd379ea9699f63464e8)
```scala
class MyClass // not Serializable

class TestClass extends Serializable {

  @transient
  lazy val foo: MyClass =
    new MyClass
}
```

Relevant javap output in 2.11.8:
```java
public class TestClass implements scala.Serializable {
  private transient MyClass foo;
...
```

And in 2.12.0:
```java
public class TestClass implements scala.Serializable {
  private MyClass foo;
...
```
