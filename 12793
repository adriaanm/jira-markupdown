Currently

Buffer.+ adds value to this and returns this. But operation + should not have side effect, i. e. + should not change this.

I think += should be changed to return this, and + should return new buffer:

{code}
/** Append a single element to this buffer and return the identity of the buffer */
def +=(elem: A): Buffer[A]

/** Append a single element to this buffer and return new buffer */
def +(elem: A): Buffer[A]
{code}

So current code

{code}
buffer + 1 + 2 + 3
{code}

will be:

{code}
buffer += 1 += 2 += 3
{code}
