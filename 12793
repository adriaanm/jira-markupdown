Currently

Buffer.+ adds value to this and returns this. But operation + should not have side effect, i. e. + should not change this.

I think <ins>= should be changed to return this, and </ins> should return new buffer:
```scala
/** Append a single element to this buffer and return the identity of the buffer */
def +=(elem: A): Buffer[A]

/** Append a single element to this buffer and return new buffer */
def +(elem: A): Buffer[A]
```

So current code
```scala
buffer + 1 + 2 + 3
```

will be:
```scala
buffer += 1 += 2 += 3
```
