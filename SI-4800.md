If scala.bat is run from a Cygwin bash shell on Windows XP the value of OS variable is CYGWIN_NT-5.1, not Windows_NT. Thus you need to check for %OS% NEQ Windows_NT *and* %OS:~0,9% NEQ CYGWIN_NT before bailing out.
(extempore in [r25993|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25993]) Made windows less aggressive about failing.

There's no way to ever correctly check against a platform
String and then fail if it doesn't exactly match.  You have
to handle such things gracefully, because even if you have
omniscience and omnipotence at the time you write it, you will
become wrong later.

  // example of a condition a vast distance from what should
  // be tested before intentionally failing
  if "%OS%" NEQ "Windows_NT"

Closes SI-4800.
