I'd love that too, here's my thoughts:

given that there are only a couple of people on the planet who understand the ForkJoinX code, and the only relevant change that would impact ParCol (at least that I made) was to cap the max threads of the pool (uncapped it's 32k), we have to either conclude that: A) The failing test is somehow broken. B) It needs to be able to spawn more threads than it currently is allowed to C) ForkJoin is somehow broken

For A) I think Aleks is probably the best debugger
For B) It's myself
For C) It's Doug Lea
