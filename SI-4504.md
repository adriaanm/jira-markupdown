Hi, I'm using a remote fsc server to compile different Scala projects.  However sometimes the fsc server crashes (version 2.8.1) and I have to restart it again.  Unfortunately the new fsc instance is choosing a random port where it listens on and thus I have to change the compiler configurations in all of Scala projects in order to use the new fsc server again.  To avoid this update procedure I suggest to add an option (e.g. command line argument) for specifying the port that is used by fsc.

Among others one would have the following advantages:
- simpler and more secure firewall configurations (restricted to a single port instead of a large port range)
- more uniform and stable Scala compiler configurations in enterprises (fixed port is easy to set up and does not need adoptions)
{code}
Usage: fsc <options> <source files>
where possible fsc options include:
[...]
  -server <hostname:portnumber>  Specify compile server socket
[...]
{code}

Isn't that what you want?
As long as fsc does not allow to set the fsc port Linux users/administrators can use the following bash script as workaround.
Note that the variables in the head have to be adopted to the specific environment, redir has to be installed, and FSC_TMP_DIR needs to be shared by server and client machines.
The script is also suitable to run different fsc instances (e.g. different versions of fsc) on different ports.
