This seems to be yet another case where where subtypes of a sealed supertype cause larger-than-necessary types.

I think analogous to the reasoning in https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7402 and https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7403, Either should extend Product and Serializable itself too.
