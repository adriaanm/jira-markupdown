That's some very nice type inference blow up... 
For example, {{def l10}}'s inferred return type is roughly 8.6M characters long. That's a bit much.

You can avoid it by manually annotating the return of your methods (with {{Parser\[Any\]}} probably here). It's generally a good thing to do anyway.

It still happens with GenBCode, and the error message could be improved (if I could figure out where to test for this exactly).
