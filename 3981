Adriaan (since I figure this is you) I patched transpose to fail fast and here's what it says with the above program:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: traverse arguments are irregular:
  first was List(Nats._0) (length 1)
  later was List(Nats._1, Nats.Nat, Nats.Inc) (length 3)
```
