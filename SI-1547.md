The floating point parser in scala.util.parsing.combinator.JavaTokenParsers appears to be incorrect.  The function in the code is:


```scala
def floatingPointNumber: Parser[String] = 
    """-?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\d*\.\d+)[eEfFdD]?([+-]?\d+)?""".r
```

However, this regular expression fails to correctly parse all valid floats.  For example, 9e4f, which is valid in java, fails with the above regex.  Even worse, it allows through invalid expressions.  For example, 9+3, which is not a parsable float, is successfully captured by the above regex.  

I believe the regular expression should be modified to allow trailing exponents only if "e" or "E" trails the first number sequence; to allow "D"/"d"/"F"/"f" if there is an exponent; and to allow an optional "+" at the front of the expression.  I am not a regex expert, but I believe the following definition will satisfy the above requirements:

```scala
def floatingPointNumber: Parser[String] =
    """[+-]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\d*\.\d+)([eE][+-]?\d+)?[fFdD]?""".r
```

Please also supply a complete example.
I hit the same problem a few weeks back but didn't get around to reporting it. The above solution is better than the current state, but still not complete wrt. the Java Language Specification. I would propose to add the following methods to JavaTokenParsers:

```scala
    def decimalIntegerLiteral: Parser[String] =
      """-?(0|[1-9]\d*)[lL]?""".r
    def octalIntegerLiteral: Parser[String] =
      """-?0[0-7]+[lL]?""".r
    def hexIntegerLiteral: Parser[String] =
      """-?0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+[lL]?""".r
    def floatingPointLiteral: Parser[String] =
      ("-?(" +
      """(\d+\.\d*|\.\d+)([eE][+-]?\d+)?[fFdD]?|""" +
      """\d+[eE][+-]?\d+[fFdD]?|""" +
      """\d+([eE][+-]?\d+)?[fFdD]""" +
      ")").r
```

The integers can be parsed using java.lang.Integer.decode(), parseInt() does not handle the radix prefix. I've broken up the float expression for readability, but I hope that this does not incur a runtime cost.
