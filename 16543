src/compiler/scala/reflect/runtime/Settings.scala contains following comment:
```
/** The Settings class for runtime reflection.
 *  This should be refined, so that settings are settable via command 
 *  line options or properties.
 */
```

Yes, this is especially useful for debugging purposes. I believe we should use properties mechanism from scala.util.Properties object. The idea would be that in order to create a mirror one would need to supply settings with sane default. I would be able to alter those settings using -Dscala.reflect.* properties.
