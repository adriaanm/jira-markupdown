The spec says:

{quote}
The handler h is expected conform to type `scala.PartialFunction[scala.Throwable, pt]`
{quote}

The implementation wrongly appears to assume {{s/conform to/be compatible with/}}.
In fact, when the spec says "is expected to conform to type PT", implicit conversions are allowed. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The expression is typed with expected type PT.
2. As part of (1), if it has at first a different type, implicit conversions are tried. If one succeeds, it gets applied, yielding a final result expression.
3. That expression does conform to PT.


Right you are...

FWIW, here's a somewhat facile counter example:

{quote}
A singleton type is of the form p.type, where p is a path pointing to a value expected to conform (ยง6.1) to scala.AnyRef. The type denotes the set of values consisting of null and the value denoted by p.
{quote}

{code}
scala> { val p = 0; implicit def intToString(i: Int) = ""; type T = p.type }
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : p.type (with underlying type Int)
 required: AnyRef
              { val p = 0; implicit def intToString(i: Int) = ""; type T = p.type }
                                                                           ^
{code}

I suppose the unwritten detail is whether or not implicit conversions are allowed in a particular context.
