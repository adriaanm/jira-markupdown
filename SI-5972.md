```scala
val it = Array(1, 2, 3).iterator
it.take(1).toList // 1
it.take(1).toList // 1
```

The code worked correctly in Scala 2.8-2.9
```
It is of particular importance to note that, unless stated otherwise, one should never use an iterator after calling a method on it. The two most important exceptions are also the sole abstract methods: next and hasNext.
