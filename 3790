Take Tuple2 for example, I think  SI-2634 would be fixed if we chang the implementation of class Tuple2#Zipped like this:
{code}
class Zipped[+Repr1, +El1, +Repr2, +El2](coll1: TraversableLike[El1, Repr1], coll2: IterableLike[El2, Repr2]) { 
    def map[B, To](f: (El1, El2) => B)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[Repr1, B, To]): To = {
      val elems2 = coll2.iterator

      for(el1 <- coll1 if(elems2.hasNext)) yield f(el1, elems2.next)
    }
	...
}
{code}

And Tuple2#zip should be changed in the same way.

Since I don't have chance to test it, I apologize if I have missed something.
