Forward port was recommended by -[~ichoran]- you (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5528#issuecomment-260927187) as it may include visibility changes to the API, i.e. no need to reimplement methods from {{HashTable}}.
FYI: the build failed with {{NPE}} for my commit after merge, is it a randomly failing test, or a real one? (https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/job/scala-2.12.x-validate-test/3717/console)
