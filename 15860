Calling .getGenericReturnType or .getGenericParameterTypes on that specific method object fails with a jl.reflect.GenericSignatureFormatError

It is possible that the Scala compiler produces invalid classfiles for other cases as well, but I only had problems with this method for now.
```scala
  classOf[List[_]].getMethods.find(_.getName == "orElse").get.getGenericReturnType
```

a return value of type jl.reflect.Type

a java.lang.reflect.GenericSignatureFormatError
