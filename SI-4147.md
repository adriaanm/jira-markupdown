= problem =
When converting code-bases as a proof of concept it is often necessary to have some working code after a short time. Having no mutable sorted implementations of Map is a big obstacle, because it forces code using it to be rewritten (which might make sense in a later step though) and makes it hard to argue that Scala is a good upgrade path from Java.

= analysis =
immutable.TreeMap exists but mutable implementation is missing in Scala's standard library.

= enhancement recommendation =
Scala should ship with support for this data structure.



Sorry, for double post, but it's just unreadable, w/o line-breaks. [[BR]]

Well, I'm currently working on a mutable TreeSet/Map? Implementation based on an AVL Tree. While it is on average a bit more costly (but still O(log n)) to insert a value into an AVL Tree compared to a Red-Black Tree, it can check containments faster than Red-Black Trees because they are more balanced.[[BR]]

Well.. I've only implemented insert and contains yet, but we'll see what I can do over the weekend. Some performance results: n = 1 << 28 Creating Sets through insertion of n randomly generated numbers:[[BR]]
Immutable TreeSet: 14658 ms[[BR]]
My AVL TreeSet: 6129 ms[[BR]]
HashSet (immutable): 13397 ms[[BR]]
Checking containment of n randomly generated numers:[[BR]]
Immutable TreeSet: 6745 ms[[BR]]
My AVL TreeSet: 3948 ms[[BR]]
HashSet (immutable): 1797 ms[[BR]]

So, it's at least not slower :D[[BR]]

I implemented a mutable TreeSet backed by an immutable AVL Tree.
You can find my proposal here : https://github.com/lpereir4/t4147
Assertion based test and scalacheck test can be found in src/test/scala

I may be needing this in one of my projects. If you're still into adding a mutable.TreeMap to the standard Scala collections, I can do a PR to 2.12.x once (and if) I'm able to implement it :) Personally, I think a mutable sorted map is more than common enough to warrant appearing in the standard lib of a programming language.

Note that this would also (arguably) resolve https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6938
