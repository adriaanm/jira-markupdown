```scala
object O {
  private[this] case class C
  O.C // should not be accessible
}
```

Mark is quite right that is as specified, but I'm going to hijack this ticket to open the different but related bug I discovered when looking at it.
```scala
class O1 {
  private[this] case class C()
  
  val x = new O1
  
  println(x.C())   // should not be accessible
  println(new x.C) // is correctly not accessible
}
```
That looks very much like the private[this] is not being propagated to C's synthetic companion object, so the constructor has the right access but the factory is merely private.
