The script
```scala
  def sum(xs: Iterable[Int]): Long = {
    var sum = 0L
    xs.foreach((x) => sum = sum + x)
    sum
  }

  println(sum(Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1 to Integer.MAX_VALUE))
```

returns 0 where as
```scala
  println(sum(List(Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1, Integer.MAX_VALUE)))
```

returns 4294967293. A helpful community member looked in Range and identified this
```scala
  val until = if (inInterval(end)) end + 1 else end
```

as the defect. We've reproduced it on Scala 2.7 and 2.8. Additional commentary is available at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1635094
