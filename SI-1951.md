The file doc/README in package scala-2.7.4.final.tgz lists several commands for testing the distribution.  These commands refer to the file share/doc/scala/examples/sort.scala , but these files aren't part of the scala-2.7.4.final.tgz package.  (These instructions are in the "Unix Installation" section of the README).

I see that there is a separate tgz on the website with "Scala API and code examples".  It's fine if you've chosen not to distribute the sort.scala example in the default package, but in that case the README needs to be changed, either providing a different test, or instructing the user to install the code examples package.
This is not fixed in scala-2.7.7.final.  From the Unix installation instructions in doc/README:

{{You may test the distribution by running the following commands:

$$ ./bin/scalac share/doc/scala/examples/sort.scala}}
