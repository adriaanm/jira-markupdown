The docs (https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Syntax) say:

Entity links: [[scala.collection.Seq]] becomes a link to the corresponding entity like Seq. The entity must be linked using fully-qualified names (scala.collection.Seq instead of Seq); this requirement may be relaxed in a future release.

However, embedding this:
[[akka.dispatch.Future]]
into ScalaDoc does not do anything; no formatting and no link.
I'm closing the bug as duplicate as the two problems have been previously pointed out:
- relaxing fully qualified names requirement: SI-3695
- linking to external projects: SI-191
