Replying to [ticket:3975 magarcia]:

The example in ticket SI-3974 does not show method-chaining of dynamic calls, but they are also amenable to refactoring as the following example shows: 

{code}
    new AnyRef {
      def abc { ... }
    }.abc
{code}


formulated using "atomic evaluation" becomes 

{code}
  {
    val tmp = new AnyRef {
      def abc { ... }
    }
    tmp.abc
  }
{code}

thus making room for the class definition: 

{code}
  {
    class Boilerplate extends AnyRef {
      def abc { ... }
    }
    val tmp = new Boilerplate
    tmp.abc
  }
{code}
