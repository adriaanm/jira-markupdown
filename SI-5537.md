Welcome to Scala version v2.10.0-M2-87-gc3569aa4c6 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_25).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.

scala> List[Predef.type](Predef)
res0: List[type] = List(scala.Predef$@3c7a279c)
{code}
Well, I'd like to see it (by it I mean the toString of Type) print:

{code}
res0: List[Predef.type] = List(scala.Predef$@3c7a279c)
{code}

in this particular case, because List[type] looks kind of incorrect.
This is a pretty picky ticket - I assume you didn't realize it, but this is specific to Predef, not all singleton types.  It omits Predef so you don't see types like "Predef.String" all over the place.
