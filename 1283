Since ticket scala/bug#1460 has a test case, I checked to see what releases had problems with it: 2.7.1 was ok, 2.7.2 rc2, rc3, rc4 and the latest revision of 2.7.2 branch all blew up. It definitely looks like an infinite loop (I tried a huge stack size of 2000m at some point). As suggested by David on IRC, it may be that some change between RC4 and RC5 caused this same infinite loop to be entered for Blair's project. The infinite loop itself has been there for some time though.
