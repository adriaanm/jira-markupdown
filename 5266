Relevant paragraph in the language spec is 5.3.2.

The description of the apply method misses the sentence about
"[...] is implicitly added to every case class unless the class already has a member (directly defined or inherited) with that name." (copy, equals, hashCode adn toString have a comparable description.)

I wonder if there is a reason to special-case the apply method by not allowing an implementation or if it was just forgotten to add an appropriate sentence to the spec because the "or inherited" didn't apply to object methods.
