Just a note on laziness: 

While we attempt to be as lazy as possible in stream, it's more than likely that size/take/indexOf, etc. may reify one too many terms of the stream.   This is the case in *many* of the implementations because of how 'escaping' loops work.   We offer no guarantees on *when* we evaluate things, only that we defer as long as we can.

I'm migrating this to an enhancement, since the current behavior isn't 'broken'.   That said, we'll see if there's anything we can do to improve the laziness.
