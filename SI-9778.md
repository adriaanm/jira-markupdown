Currently ant.Scalac automatically sets sourepath to origin head. This leads to problem in resolving implicits. Minimal (using gradle) is here: https://github.com/romanowski/scala-minimals/tree/sourcepath-problems 

In short words:
If sourepath is set to src/master/scala then presence of scala source create new scope entries for them (for a/b/C.scala it adds class and object a.b.C - if they are not present from other source).

AFAIK sourcepath should be use only in build of scala itself so it should not be used for each compilation.
