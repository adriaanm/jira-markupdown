When a package scoped java class is in the inheritance hierarchy of a scala class, call to super method from scala results in compiler error "Unable to access method aMethod in class AJava with a super reference"

It is easily reproducible using this code:

{code:title=AJava.java|borderStyle=solid}
package test.java;

abstract class AJava {
    protected void aMethod() {
    }
}
{code}

{code:title=BJava.java|borderStyle=solid}
package test.java;

public class BJava extends AJava {
}
{code}

{code:title=CScala.scala|borderStyle=solid}
package test.scala

import test.java.BJava

class CScala extends BJava {

  protected override def aMethod() {
    super.aMethod()
  }

}
{code}

This is something which works in pure Java, and it also works for pure scala, but not for java/scala mixed code.
