[Update: I hit this again and here is how you can hit it too.]
```scala
  def f1(t: String) = {
    trait T {
      def xs = Nil map (_ => t)
    }
    ()
  }
```
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed
	at scala.Predef$$.assert(Predef.scala:79)
	at scala.tools.nsc.transform.Mixin$$MixinTransformer.scala$$tools$$nsc$$transform$$Mixin$$MixinTransformer$$$$postTransform(Mixin.scala:1031)

```

[Original report follows]
I haven't reduced this yet, but it's easy to reproduce: take current trunk as (r20482 right now) and one line in IndexedSeqViewLike.scala.
```scala
  trait Filtered extends Transformed[A] with super.Filtered {
    // add this override
    override def foreach[U](f: A => U) = super[Transformed].foreach(f)
  }
```
And scalac will crash with:
```scala
[scalacfork] Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed
[scalacfork] 	at scala.Predef$$.assert(Predef.scala:89)
[scalacfork] 	at scala.tools.nsc.transform.Mixin$$MixinTransformer.scala$$tools$$nsc$$transform$$Mixin$$MixinTransformer$$$$postTransform(Mixin.scala:1012)

Oh, and hopefully I don't have to say this, but please don't interpret the fact that I reverted the lines in the above example as in any way invalidating this bug.  It's the opposite, this bug may have stood between me and a solution to #2876.  Not for sure, but it's irrelevant because this bug is real and reproducible: but you might need to check out r20482 to easily reproduce it.
(In r21420) Interrupted attempt to fix #2897. I am committing what I have because the refactorings improve things a little bit. To fix the ticket a frightening lot more has to be done.
Closing as a duplicate of #6231.
