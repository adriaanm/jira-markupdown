There's [a tweak|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5771/files] to the docs to recommend {{raw"\d".r}}.

But ultimately, stringly composition is a losing battle.

I think there's probably a misunderstanding in Daniel's example? Interpolated text is never interpreted or escaped. There's no danger that the following might interpolate a newline. I didn't count the backslashes.

{code}
scala> val x = raw"\\\\\\\"
x: String = \\\\\\\

scala> s"${x}n"
res1: String = \\\\\\\n
{code}
