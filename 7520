Note that you will get the correct error message if you comment out everything apart from Template class.
This is because checking the bounds is done during refchecks.

{code}
new CurveTemplate(new Curve).withTimeout(2000L)
{code}
will need to perform dealiasing in order to get the type of withTimeout (again before Refchecks) and that will simply have ErrorType as a result type, which already gives you pretty uninformative error message.
Now, if you additionally call on the result
{code}
... .withReadModifiers(...)
{code}
it is just getting lost and crashes after typers. So either we will be checking the bounds earlier or basically we defer this check until refchecks.
I have a solution for that, but it needs a bit more testing.
