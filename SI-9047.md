When using the back-slash operator on a `NodeSeq`, the behaviour does not match how XPath works. Getting the attribute value works when there's only a single element in the node sequence:

```scala
> val x = <x><a b='1'/></x>
> x \ "a" \ "@b"
res2: scala.xml.NodeSeq = 1
```

but fails when there are more:

```scala
> val x = <x><a b='1'/><a b='2'/></x>
> x \ "a" \ "@b"
res3: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq()
```

expected:
```scala
res3: Seq(1, 2)
```
I've taken a look at this and opened a PR with tests and a possible fix: [SI-9047: Extract attributes from multiple elements](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/pull/43/files).
