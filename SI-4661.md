(extempore in [r25050](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25050)) Fixed a repl regression with parentheses handling, reminding me
we really need that honest parser phase which doesn't betray us
with parentheses abandonment and dramatic desugarings.  I'll
promote it from page 14 to page 11.  Closes #4661, no review.
