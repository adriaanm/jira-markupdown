You have come up with a use case for triple backticks.
```scala
val ```abc`def``` = 42
```
There is revised language at [this change](https://github.com/som-snytt/scala/commit/ab527ce8cc0220443bda5cc3337ebae158c2fe74) around "printable". I don't see a more recent nightly or 2.12 spec yet, but [the source says this](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/spec/01-lexical-syntax.md#string-literals).

Also conceivably, it could accept ``abc\u0060def`` by blessing the unicode form.

Backtick is not [backslashable](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/01-lexical-syntax.html#escape-sequences).
