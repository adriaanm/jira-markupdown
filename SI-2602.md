I noticed while auto-indenting a whole file via ctrl+a, ctrl+i:

The lines following the definition of this abstract function 'candidates'

def candidates( s: AIS_State ): List[AIS_Action]

were indented very deeply. The following lines being another function definition, preceeded by javadoc-style comments. Adding a semi-colon after List[AIS_Action] and auto-indenting the next lines again solved this and indentation was as it should be.
Bug SI-2459 also describes a specific case where indentation is wrong.
