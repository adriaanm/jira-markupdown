This is a terrible example of using Lower Bounds but it does reveal a behaviour that seemed unexpected.
```scala
trait Animal
case class Foo()
case class Cage[A >: Animal](animal: A)
val cage = Cage(Foo())
```

In this example, I would expect that that the compiler would infer:

{code: scala}
cage: Cage[AnyRef] = Cage(Foo())
```scala

But the compiler actually infers:

{code: scala}
cage: Cage[Object] = Cage(Foo())
```
