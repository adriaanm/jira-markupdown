The documentation says "returns a pair consisting of the longest prefix of this string whose elements all satisfy [predicate] p, and the rest of this string."

You probably want
```scala
scala> "de_DE".split('_')
res11: Array[String] = Array(de, DE)
```

or
```scala
scala> "de_DE".span(_ != '_')
res9: (String, String) = (de,_DE)
```
