I have looked into that a bit and I assume that this has to do with RawTypes.

The situation is this:

{code}
CollapsedStringAdapter extends javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter<String,String>
{code}

But the annotation {code}@interface XmlJavaTypeAdapter{code} accepts only {code}Class<? extends XmlAdapter>{code} as a value.
I suspect that it would work with {code}Class<? extends XmlAdapter<?,?>>{code} or something similar.
