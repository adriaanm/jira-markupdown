The type-checker fails to find an implicit definition that has an F-bounded type parameter.
Here's a minimized example:

{code:scala}
object Test {
  trait A[-T]
  trait B[-T]
  class C extends B[C]
  implicit def AfromB[T <: B[T]]: A[T] = null

  implicitly[A[C]]  // fails
  implicitly[A[C]](AfromB[C]) // ok if argument is given explicitly
}
{code}

Dotty compiles this OK. The example came up in an attempt to provide multiversal equality for Scala.
Might be the same underlying issue as SI-5070
Nope, it is seems unrelated. My patch for SI-5070 doesn't help. (That said, you might want to look at the comments of that ticket again, Martin, as I showed an example where dotty's implicit search fails with dependent method types.)

The error in this ticket is:

{noformat}
âš¡ qscalac -Xlog-implicits test/files/pos/t9764.scala
test/files/pos/t9764.scala:7: AfromB is not a valid implicit value for Test.A[Test.C] because:
typing TypeApply reported errors for the implicit tree: type arguments [Any] do not conform to method AfromB's type parameter bounds [T <: Test.B[T]]
  implicitly[A[C]]  // fails
            ^

Which miminizes the problem to:

{code}
object Test {
  trait A[-T]
  trait B[-T]
  class C extends B[C]
  def AfromB[T <: B[T]]: A[T] = null
  AfromB : A[C]
}
{code}
Okay, the bounds of `T` don't contribute constraints because they are cyclic:

https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/d24e298cbd955101a6b4342602b32ed37643dfb0/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/tpe/TypeConstraints.scala#L212

I guess this is to avoid having type vars on LHS and RHS of a subtyping check.

Dotty typechecks this as:

{code}
Test.AfromB[Test.C']: Test.A[Test.C]
{code}

How does it come to this solution? Is C really the maximal type in the range `C <: T <: B[T]`. Why not `B[C]`? This would make a great blog post, hint, hint!

I've got my ups and downs upside down, that last comment wasn't quite right.

I see now that the key difference in inference is that scalac solves for T in `adapt(Test.this.AfromB[T], pt = Test.A[Test.C])`, whereas dotc does this a little later at `adapt((Test.AfromB[T]: Test.A[Test.C], pt = Test.A[Test.C])`

By that time, T has the constraints:

{noformat}
Constraint(
 uninstVars = T;
 constrained types = [T <: Test.B[LazyRef(T)]]Test.A[T]
 bounds = 
     T >: Test.C <: Test.B[LazyRef(T)] & Test.C
 ordering = 
)
{noformat}

Given that the T does not appear in the type of this expression, dotc instantiates it to its lower bound, C.

This differs from scalac, which would have picked the upper bound (had it not been cyclic), given that T was in a contravariant position.
Removing the f-bound lets us see this difference in action:

{code}
object Test {
  trait A[-T]
  trait B[-T]
  class C extends B[C]
  def AfromB[T <: B[_]]: A[T] = null
  AfromB : A[C]
}

{code}

scalac:
{code}
(Test.this.AfromB[Test.B[_]]: Test.A[Test.C])
{code}

dotc:
{code}
Test.AfromB[Test.C']: Test.A[Test.C]
{code}
