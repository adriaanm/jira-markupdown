One fix Idea from Martin : could `partest` accept a filter file, or a regular expression filter as a configuration parameter ?

That way it would remove lines that match that particular filter from the program's output before comparing it to the `.check` output. This also solves the issue of not being able to predict all possible VM routine warnings (and it would probably allow us to remove some garbage in tests' check files).
