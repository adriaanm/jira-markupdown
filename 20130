The old (2.10/2.11) scaladoc used to put type aliases in package objects into "package.html", the new one uses "index.html", thus making it impossible to link correctly to these members when cross-building on 2.11 and 2.12.

See https://travis-ci.org/slick/slick/builds/142174330 for a failure caused by this.

On 2.11, you can link to

{code}
api/slick/dbio/package.html#DBIO[+R]=slick.dbio.DBIOAction[R,slick.dbio.NoStream,slick.dbio.Effect.All]
{code}

which gets redirected to

{code}
api/index.html#slick.dbio.package@DBIO[+R]=slick.dbio.DBIOAction[R,slick.dbio.NoStream,slick.dbio.Effect.All]
{code}

On 2.11.0-M5 you need

{code}
api/slick/dbio/index.html#DBIO[+R]=slick.dbio.DBIOAction[R,slick.dbio.NoStream,slick.dbio.Effect.All]
{code}

There doesn't seem to be a link format that works for both versions.
