Well, given that it isn't an actual complete code example, I think the meaning of `indexOf` is conceptual (meant for a quick glance, and not for much scrutiny). Regardless, the line you take issue with has long been removed, so it should be of no issue anymore.

Until 2.10 is out, the nightlies are a better go-to for updated/expanded docs. My advice is to reach for them until 2.10 lands.

Sure, your correction sounds reasonable. Feel free to submit a pull-request (guidelines are here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vBHur7dd4UlTiL7dUd8RjzjQNKrz-KU38i2QYpyzL7w/edit]), and make sure to make the following spelling correction: indexes => indices
