I would expect that *val*s of an class/object are either not accessible before their declaration (=> compile-error) or they should already be initialized. (see attached example)

Really, I mean this is a source of unnecessary bugs. Futhermore *it breaks the contract of vals, because the value changes* from the default to the assigned. 

Actually, I would strongly recommend to make it result in a compile error 'undeclared', as it isn't a that time.
Marking the use undeclared would not solve the problem, because you could still write the following and observe this

{code}
class Foo {
  println ( this.foo )
  val foo = 1
}
{code}

It is less than ideal, but we have discussed the problem, and I am told that attempts to fix this have been made in the past, and given the limitations of the JVM, they were all worse.
