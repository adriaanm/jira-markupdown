against 2.11, which must be merged forward for 2.12.

Somebody ought to update SBT not to use API deprecated since 2.9.0. That would make it easier to control these extension points.

In older code, the reader set by SBT was immediately overwritten; in the newer code, the reader was initialized before the call to createInterpreter, which SBT overrides (and in which SBT sets its own reader).
