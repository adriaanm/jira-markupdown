Scala currently has a method {{StringLike#r}} for compiling strings to regexes. 

Now that Scala has string interpolation and macros I think we can do even better with a {{r}} method on {{StringContext}}. Here is why:

1. Escaping gets simpler (before: {{"""\d+""".r}}, after: {{r"\d+"}})

2. Parameterization gets simpler (before: {{("foo"+Pattern.escape(bar)).r}}, after: {{r"foo$bar"}})

3. Regexes can be syntax-checked at compile-time

4. Pattern matching against regexes gets simpler (before: {{val re = """\d+(.*)\d+""".r; â€¦ case `re`\(x\) => x}}, after: {{case r"\d+$x\d+" => x}})

I have a proof of concept implementation available at https://github.com/qerub/scala-regex-stringcontext and can make a patch for Scala proper if people like this idea.
There's an alternative version of interpolation matching where the interpolated text will always match the existing capture groups. By convention, people write things like {{(\d+)$x (\d+)$y}}, but that works just like {{(\d+) (\d+)$x$y}}. Anyway, such code was recently used by Adriaan Moors on a presentation (iirc), and can also be seen in [this blog|http://hacking-scala.tumblr.com/post/50360896036/regular-expressions-interpolation-in-pattern-matching].

Personally, I think that style is error prone, since the order in which things get assigned is not related to their position, but to the number of capturing groups. Add a capture group by mistake, and the match will start failing.

Of _these_ two, I do prefer my own version (as described in my blog post already mentioned), and I do like {{.*}} over any of the alternatives, but that does decrease the usefulness of matching quite a bit, since one often wants whatever is being capture to follow a pattern of its own.

What I'd *really* rather do is go with macros and use named patterns. Java 7 supports {{(?<NAME>X)}} to specify named capture groups. A Scala macro could check the string for named capture groups and assign them (with or without Java 7 support), *and* translate a string with them into one with normal interpolation, such as the one in the blog I mention. Since the macro will check the regex for named groups, it can ensure that the names are properly assigned, and give compile time errors when matching if there are unnamed capture groups.

We could always go for untyped macros ;) https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5903
I'm hijacking this issue, if that's OK, for a macro that does named groups (by parsing them out, for Java 6 support, and supplying them to `Regex`) and as a bonus (which I think was a D.C. Sobral request on StackOverflow), optional groups are extracted as Option instead of nullable.  I don't know why they call them macros instead of magic.

Still to do: interpolator ensures holes and groups balance; nail down a nicer syntax for how holes "bind" to groups. Note that `(\d+)$i` is kind of backward to `$i%d`.

Since we are used to f-interp, how about a scanf version, `sf"$s%s $n%d $v%f"`, that would cover the common extractions.

No effort yet to turn r"(?<x>text)" into r"$x(text)", but you do get (m group "x").

I previously did some work to "fast-track" it, which I can pursue later if there's interest.
