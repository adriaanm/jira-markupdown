hi Miles,
I've not tried with command tools, but my project compile fine with 2.7.7 plugin.
The error seem to realated on  scala.tools.nsc.Properties, and today, for example, with r20799-b20100205020222 I've the same error on compiling and the compiler settings and the preferences editor does not work in the Eclipse preference dialog.
