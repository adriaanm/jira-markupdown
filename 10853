I may have misunderstood http://docs.scala-lang.org/scala/2.11/ when it and the 2.11 release notes showed "JSR-223 Scripting Engine support" as a feature in 2014, thinking that the "out of scope" comment from 2011 no longer obtained. Not knowing the players or being familiar with the processes in the project, I didn't twig that @rjolly (whose PR it was) isn't part of "the Scala team".  

I spent a *lot* of time going though gyrations trying to get the classpath right in our sbt-based Play app so we could actually get a Scala `ScriptEngine` started in the Java library we were calling from Scala, only to find that once I did, it wasn't possible to read or write variables into the script environment from Java. 

This was a huge disappointment. Certainly `javax.script.ScriptEngine` says "ScriptEngine is the fundamental interface whose methods must be fully functional in every implementation of this specification."; there's no notion there of a "minimal support" level, so when it doesn't work, it's just a bug. I haven't researched deeply into back releases of 2.11 (we were on 2.8 until I led an effort to get us to 2.11 that was substantially motivated by wanting to use JSR-223) but based on the example in the "Overview" it looks to me like this part of it actually worked at some time in the past.
