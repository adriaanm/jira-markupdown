I don't understand what's happening, but the example can be reduced to:

{code}
case class MetaData[A]

class Prod{
 val metadataMap = 
    Map(
      "id" -> 
        MetaData[Double](),
      "price" ->
        MetaData[Int]() )
        
  def loadFrom {    
    for((key, field) <- metadataMap if key != "id"){
    }
  }
}

object Main extends Application {
  val p1 = new Prod().loadFrom
}
{code}

Interestingly, replacing Double with Int works...
