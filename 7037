The value is generated when necessary. array.toList does not have the same behavior because it is a strict collection, while Stream is non-strict. 

Non-strictness combines poorly with mutability, as this clearly shows. However, the solution is *not* to make a non-strict collection strict, but, rather, to point to people that non-strictness is difficult to reason about in the presence of mutability, and, therefore, that they should avoid combining both.
