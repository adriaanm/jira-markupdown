I'm having trouble integrating scala with java in eclipse.
Specically, the builder doesn’t seem to recognize Java source folders in referenced projects, and even when I moved it to the same project the import line still had an error that it couldn't find that package, although all the references to imported classes became not an error.[[BR]]
Maybe it's because it doesn’t know that it has to build java classes in a scala project?
