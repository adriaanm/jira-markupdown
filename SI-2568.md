Scala compiler does allow to override private[C] or protected[C] member in a class that is defined outside of C. IMHO, according to the scala reference this should not be allowed. Please see attached source.
This seems fine to me. Could you quote the exact passage in the reference that says this should not be allowed?

You're allowed to widen access in subclasses, just like in Java, so it's okay to do this:

{code}
  package pkg2 {
    class A {
      // Same with protected[pkg2]
      private[pkg2] def f = 0      
    }
  }
  
  class B extends pkg2.A   { // class A is visible here, so we can extend it and override its non-final members
    // f is now public
    override def f = 1
  }
{code}
I must disagree. The problem is not with extending pkg2.A but with overriding its private[pkg2] member which is invisible in class B. If you treat qualified private as a generalization of Java's private then, by analogy to overriding private member in Java (which is not allowed), I should not be allowed to override private[C] outside of C. Anyway, let me cite Scala Reference (section 5.2):

<<<<<
The modifier can be qualified with an identifier C (e.g. private[C]) that must
denote a class or package enclosing the definition. Members labeled with
such a modifier are accessible respectively only from code inside the package
C or only from code inside the class C and its companion module (�5.4).
Such members are also inherited only from templates inside C.
>>>>>

I'm not sure what the last sentence mean (how can I inherit private[C] member from template not inside C? Such template cannot have private[C] member.), but certainly the remaining states that B cannot access A's private[pkg2] member.



What is done at the bytecode level has no bearing on what the language should allow for. It is definitively a bug that f1() and f2() in the appended code are inherited by classes outside s1 and O respectively. That the methods can even be overridden makes access a sham. What is the point of a specification if it is to be discarded whenever it is inconvenient?

That it actually works as it's supposed to if the qualifier is a class name means trial-and-error is the only way to discover the behavior.

{code}
package s1 {
  object O {
    class A {
      private[s1] def f1(): Int = 1
      private[O]  def f2(): Int = 2
      private[A]  def f3(): Int = 3
    }
  }
}
package s2 {
  class B extends s1.O.A {
    override def f1() = 11  // allowed
    override def f2() = 12  // allowed
    override def f3() = 13  // disallowed
    // ./a.scala:15: error: method f3 overrides nothing
    //     override def f3() = 12
    //                  ^
    // one error found
  }
}
{code}
