Hi Michael, thanks for trying out the new milestone! We're aware of this limitation and hope to lift it by the time 2.12.0 is out. Note that the closure allocation is not yet eliminated, even in your first example (the `invokedynamic` instruction is still there), that's another thing that's still on the TODO list.
