scanLeft is similar to foldLeft but it collects all intermediate results. For instance a list of cumulative sums can be calculated simply:

```scala
scala> List(2, 4, 1, 8, 5).scanLeft(0)(_+_)
res0: List[Int] = List(0, 2, 6, 7, 15, 20)
```
 
Example implementation + scalacheck property:

```scala
  def scanLeft[B, That](z: B)(op: (B, A) => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = {
    val (_, b) = foldLeft(z, bf(repr) += z) { (acc, x) =>
      val next = op(acc._1, x)
      (next, acc._2 += next)
    }
    b.result
  }

  property("scanLeft") = forAll { (xs: List[Int], z: Int) => {
    val sums = xs.scanLeft(z)(_ + _)
    sums.zip(sums.tail).map(x => x._2 - x._1) == xs
```
{code}

scanRight would be useful too but it is surprisingly tricky to implement it in TraversableLike (if possible at all?).
Stream should perhaps override it and provide a lazy version. Something like (those casts hurt my eyes):

```scala
  override final def scanLeft[B, That](z: B)(op: (B, A) => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], B, That]): That = {
    (if (this.isEmpty) Stream(z)
    else new Stream.Cons(z, tail.scanLeft(op(z, head))(op).asInstanceOf[Stream[B]])).asInstanceOf[That]
  }
```

Otherwise this will blow the stack:
```scala
  Stream.from(0).scanLeft(0)(_+_).take(10)
```

It seems that scanRight does not work as expected:

```scala
scala> List(1,2,3).scanRight(0)(_+_)
res0: List[Int] = List(0, 3, 5, 6)
```

The result should be reversed:
```scala
List(6, 5, 3, 0)
```
Replying to [comment:8 dcsobral]:

Yes, Haskell has 'scanr' function which produces a list in right-to-left order. Please see 'Scans' from:
