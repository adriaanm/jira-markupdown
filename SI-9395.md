This code:

```scala
class MyClass {
    def something(in: String): String = {
        in + "_z"
    }

    def something: (String) => String = {
        case _ => "Fixed"
    }
}

val my = new MyClass()

println(List("x", "y").map(my.something))
```

Prints List(Fixed, Fixed).

The type checker is calling the no-argument variant of my.something(), and then silently taking the return type and passing it to map(). This ignores the other matching one-argument version of my.something.

The below line (arguably correctly) produces a compile error about an "ambiguous reference to overloaded definition":

```scala
val fun: String => String = my.something(_)
```

Adding parentheses to the no-argument definition of the method removes the issue. Changing the return type of the no-argument method to be anything other than String => String removes the issue.

I think this is incorrect behavior; where there is a conflict between the result of an implicit conversion (the my.something() return value) and an unconverted correct type, either the unconverted type should win or a compile error should be thrown telling the user about ambiguity. In other words, the above code should either output List(x_z, y_z) or fail to compile. Currently the implicitly converted version is silently taking precedence.
Possible debug script can be found here:

```
scala> class MyClass {
     | def something(in: String): String = {
     | in + "_z"
     | }
     | def something: (String) => String = {
     | case _ => "Fixed"
     | }
     | }

scala> val my = new MyClass()
my: MyClass = MyClass@155cf22

scala> println(List("x", "y").map(my.something))
List(Fixed, Fixed)

scala> class MyClass {
     | def something(in: String): String = {
     | in + "_z"
     | }
     | def somethingelse: (String) => String = {
     | case _ => "Fixed"
     | }
     | }
defined class MyClass

scala> println(List("x", "y").map(my.something))
List(Fixed, Fixed)

scala> val my = new MyClass()
my: MyClass = MyClass@15a4a5

scala> println(List("x", "y").map(my.something))
List(x_z, y_z)

scala> println(List("x", "y").map(my.somethingelse))
List(Fixed, Fixed)
```
In my reading of the spec, this should be ambiguous. Shorter example:

```scala
object Test extends App {
  def f(s: String): String = "1"
  val f: (String) => String = s => "2"

  val t: String => String = f

  println(t("")) // 2
}
```

http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#overloading-resolution

The reference to `f` is not an application or a type application (last paragraph of overloading resolution). Both definitions of `f` are compatible to the expected type, the method via eta-expansion (http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#implicit-conversions), so the most specific version is chosen:

 - the method is as specific as the value because the value is applicable to arguments of the method's parameter types (case 1)
 - the value is as specific as the method (case 3)

If I'm wrong in reading the spec, it would be good to add an example to it explaining this case.
