Oh yea, its been my practice to ALWAYS include a default "catch-all"
case match in a match statement (unless case classes are being used) 

  case _ => throw exception with enough info to figure out what went wrong

The compiler code in question does not have a default case match and so
the MATCH_ERROR was thrown. Not including a catch-all case match, IMHO,
is bad coding (even thought I have no doubt that all the folks working
on the compiler are much better coder than I but I code enterprise 
applications where safety and understandability is critical in the
maintenance and evolution of the code).
