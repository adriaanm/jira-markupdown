> 3) In order to meet objective 2) am I able to provide a test case that requires running against ScalaCheck?

Preferably, the test cases do not require ScalaCheck. ScalaCheck-based tests are better than nothing, though. I can take a look and see whether we can easily integrate the tests with the standard Scala test suite.

> 4) I'd like to revise the submitted patch, since the Either that I use has evolved heavily from use in commercial project. Though, probably only minor changes from the patch, but still important. Is this OK?

Sure, just attach the new version of the patch. Sorry for the delay.
