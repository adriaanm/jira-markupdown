according to the specification -> Lexical Syntax -> Character Literals and String Literals, non-printable characters are not valid literals. However, the literal '\u000A' as well as a literal newline character are accepted by the lexer (the spec explicitly mentions  '\u000A' as being illegal)

In strings, the lexer also accepts "\u000A" though it doesn't accept a literal newline character
I'm not sure I understand. The relevant sentence in the spec (https://github.com/adriaanm/scala-ref-markdown/blob/master/03-lexical-syntax.md#character-literals) is:
> The character is either a printable unicode character or is described by an [escape sequence](#escape-sequences).

This explicitly allows  '\u000A' because it uses an escape sequence. Are you saying the Scala program
```scala
val c = '
'
```

is accepted somehow? I can't reproduce that interpretation
