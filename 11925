No exhaustiveness error is expected here unless you mark the case class {{CC}} as final.

However, even with that change to the test case, the warning is not emitted. I have a patch in https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.12.x...retronym:ticket/9630?expand=1 that fixes that problem, I'll add that to the list of patmat improvements that I'll discuss with [~moors] next week.
