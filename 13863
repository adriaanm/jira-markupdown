As some methods of RichString return new RichString objects, some unexpected behaviour may occur after Strings are converted to RichStrings implicitly. For example, "aba".reverse == "aba" will evaluate to false.

Other Rich* classes also return there base types, like ceil in RichFloat returning Float. So I think it would be consistent for methods of RichString to return String objects.
