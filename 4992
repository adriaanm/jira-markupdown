These two classes do seem to be a big mess. The behavior with regards to mutability should mirror that of more used classes, such as `ArrayBuffer`. If you want, I can come up with ScalaCheck tests comparing operations on both linked lists to operations on buffer, so that we know what's the scope of the fix required. Should I?
