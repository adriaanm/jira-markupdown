The issue is not specific to the REPL.  It is not specific to constructors and doesn't require an empty parameter list:
{code}
class B {
   def x(i: Int) = 3
   def x(implicit x: Int) = 5
}
{code}

The output of javap on B is:
{code}
public class B extends java.lang.Object implements scala.ScalaObject{
    public int x(int);
    public int x(int);
    public B();
}
{code}

In 2.7.7 a compile error is generated:
{code}
B.scala:4: error: double definition:
method x:(implicit Int)Int and
method x:(Int)Int at line 3
have same type after erasure: (Int)Int
        def x(implicit x: Int) = 5
            ^
{code}
