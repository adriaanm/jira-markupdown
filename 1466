Can you provide some guidance on using the command line tools to do this?  This is part of a large project; another member of the team has started working in Scala, and so now we have Scala code to compile, but I have never written a line of Scala code, nor have I ever run the Scala compiler outside of the build system.

We DO compile it all regularly with ant, and it seems to work there.

If you want to take a shot at this yourself

{code}
svn checkout https://projectfortress.sun.com/svn/Community/trunk PF
cd PF
ant compileAll
{code}

It is, in theory, also configured as an Eclipse project, ready to go with the scala plugin; however, Eclipse is not configured to do all the building, so the first step after checking out the project in Eclipse is {{ant compileAll}} in a console window, followed by "Project > Clean..." in Eclipse.  Before adding the scala plugin, a simple Refresh was sufficient, but now it isn't.  Another bug, perhaps?
