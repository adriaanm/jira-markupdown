I'm not sure in which phase a transformation from a `val` to `def` takes place (i.e. where simple constants get inlined into the getter accessor), but wherever it's done, the `accessed` field of the symbol should be reset to `NoSymbol`. After all, the method definition `x` below:
```scala
package <empty> {
  object A extends Object {
    final <stable> <accessor> def x(): Int = 123;
    def <init>(): A.type = {
      A.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

is no longer a getter.
