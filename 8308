I'm not sure in which phase a transformation from a {{val}} to {{def}} takes place (i.e. where simple constants get inlined into the getter accessor), but wherever it's done, the {{accessed}} field of the symbol should be reset to {{NoSymbol}}. After all, the method definition {{x}} below:

{code}
package <empty> {
  object A extends Object {
    final <stable> <accessor> def x(): Int = 123;
    def <init>(): A.type = {
      A.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
{code}

is no longer a getter.
