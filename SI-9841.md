Notably this works fine if you remove all instances of "private".
[~sethtisue] By closing this ticket are you implying that regressions in 2.11.x like this will not be fixed any more?
[~jrudolph] The last 2.11.x release is scheduled for Oct 24th. So the answer must either be "they will not be addressed" or "<pause> they will not be addressed."
[~jrudolph] It's impossible to generalize 100% about this, since if a particular issue is really severe enough, the rules change. (That's how 2.10.6 happened, and there are probably other examples in Scala history.)

I closed this ticket because I strongly suspect the core team won't be addressing it for 2.11.x, on the grounds that it isn't critical. It appears to me that in a real codebase, working around it wouldn't be that painful.

If you think the regression is important enough that we ought to reconsider whether we tackle this ourselves, go ahead and make your argument here.

Also, we could still accept a fix for 2.11.x that someone else submitted. Whether such a patch would be accepted for 2.11.9 would depend on the usual risk/benefit tradeoffs.
Thanks for the explanation, [~sethtisue]. IMO regressions always need some extra consideration as it is so easy to get stuck if the update path is obstructed by regressions. But I agree that this regression doesn't seem too bad as the workaround of not using `private object` is working fine.
