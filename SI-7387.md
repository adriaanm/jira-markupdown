In the following code example it is not immediately obvious what the error message means:

{code}
scala> class X(i: Int, j: Int) { def this(i: Int) = this(i, 0) }
defined class X

scala> class Y extends X
<console>:11: error: overloaded method constructor X with alternatives:
  (i: Int)X <and>
  (i: Int,j: Int)X
 cannot be applied to ()
       class Y extends X
               ^
{code}

First, the message should not point to the extends keyword but to the point where the constructor is called (at X). Secondly, while the error message is completely correct, it doesn't contain the information it should.

I like something like the following better:

{code}
error: multiple constructors for X available:
  (i: Int)X <and>
  (i: Int,j: Int)X
 you need to call one of them while extending X
       class Y extends X
                       ^
{code}

Because the empty parameter list is not part of the source code, I think it is useful not to mention it in the error message, for all other cases the following should be fine:

{code}
error: multiple constructors for X available:
  (i: Int)X <and>
  (i: Int,j: Int)X
 it is not possible to call one of them with (Int, Int, Int) while extending X
       class Y extends X(1,2,3)
                       ^
{code}
The caret is fixed in both scalac and repl.
{code}
scala> class Y extends X
<console>:12: error: overloaded method constructor X with alternatives:
  (i: Int)X <and>
  (i: Int,j: Int)X
 cannot be applied to ()
       class Y extends X
                       ^
{code}
The question about the empty parens is due to parens always supplied for ctor versus application.
