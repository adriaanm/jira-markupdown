The JVM spec states in Sec. 4.7.6 that for each `CONSTANT_Class_info` (constant-pool entry) which represents a class or interface that is not a member of a package an entry should be made in the class' InnerClasses JVM attribute.

According to the above, the mere fact an inner class is mentioned in, for example, an annotation wouldn't be reason enough for adding it to the InnerClasses JVM attribute.

However that's what GenASM (apparently?) does.

As an aside, this issue came up in the context of GenBCode, where `refreshInnerClasses()` in file [BCodeOpt.scala ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/GenBCodeOpt/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/BCodeOpt.scala) follows a literal interpretation of the spec.
