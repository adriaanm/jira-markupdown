In r24221 I made changes so that fsc would occasionally reuse a compiler instance as it is designed to do.  Unfortunately since then it quite enjoys hanging with no output.  An example sequence:
{code}
// you do this and it sits there indefinitely
% scala -e 'println("hi")'
// ctrl-C and do this, which nulls the cached Global instance
% fsc -reset
// this time it works
% scala -e 'println("hi")'
hi
{code}
This is not an improvement.  This behavior is "new" only because fsc has historically never reused a compiler instance for a new connection (which goes all the way back to ticket SI-84: see SI-1683 for an earlier manifestation.) I don't know what's going on internally with the Global because we don't get any output.  I should probably just disable the caching altogether.  At least we avoid jvm startup time I guess.

This should be figured out before 2.9 because scripts use fsc by default.

This can be assigned to me but I could use some input on what if anything I should expect to work with a cached Global.
I took a quick look at this.  The stack trace when it hangs is:
{code}
        at scala.tools.nsc.util.package$$$$anonfun$$waitingForThreads$$1.apply(package.scala:30)
        at scala.tools.nsc.util.package$$$$anonfun$$waitingForThreads$$1.apply(package.scala:30)
        at scala.collection.immutable.Set$$Set2.foreach(Set.scala:101)
        at scala.tools.nsc.util.package$$.waitingForThreads(package.scala:30)
        at scala.tools.nsc.ScriptRunner.withCompiledScript(ScriptRunner.scala:186)
        at scala.tools.nsc.ScriptRunner.runCommand(ScriptRunner.scala:274)
        at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner$$.process(MainGenericRunner.scala:71)
        at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner$$.main(MainGenericRunner.scala:32)
        at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner.main(MainGenericRunner.scala)
{code}

and there are two threads reading the output of the forked fsc.  This might be why it doesn't exit.  In fact, it looks like fsc shuts down when you do a ctrl+C on the first command.  The reason `fsc -reset` works might be that it starts up an fsc instance separately.

Perhaps the switch to using sys.process is the problem and not something related to a resident compiler instance?
(In r24330) Added daemonized() method to ProcessBuilder so I can do things like
start fsc without the jvm failing to exit.  More logging to fsc.
scala -e '5' now works again.  Closes SI-4254, review by harrah.
