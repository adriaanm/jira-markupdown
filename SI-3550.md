We end up imposing both inconvenience and confusion when we return collection.Map from standard methods, because you can't assign a collection.Map to an immutable.Map, which of course is what a plain old "Map "is.  There may be other places where this is an issue but this was the only one I saw on Traversable.

I already rewrote it like this:
{code}
  def groupBy[K](f: A => K): immutable.Map[K, Repr] = {
    val m = mutable.Map.empty[K, Builder[A, Repr]]
    for (elem <- this) {
      val key = f(elem)
      val bldr = m.getOrElseUpdate(key, newBuilder)
      bldr += elem
    }
    val b = immutable.Map.newBuilder[K, Repr]
    for ((k, v) <- m)
      b += ((k, v.result))
    
    b.result
  }
{code}
...and for now I will stack it up with my towering stack of patches waiting for 2.8 to ship.  But, as it brings a signature change, it'd be nice to do it now.
See also SI-2200.  When I first wrote toSet I returned collection.Set thinking that was the conservative choice, but it caused nothing but problems and it has been a happy immutable.Set ever since.  Same thing here.
Replying to [comment:2 eengbrec]:
> This problem bit me a while ago.  Fixing it now is a good idea.  My concern with your approach is that by returning an immutable map instead of a Map you're basically having to generate the map twice.

I think it's generated twice anyway, unless the compiler is currently being a lot more clever than I'm aware of.  The map which is built up incrementally is/was of type Map[K, Builder[A, Repr]] and the map which is returned is Map[K, Repr] created by mapping the first map.

I'll measure, but look at the existing code:
{code}
  def groupBy[K](f: A => K): Map[K, Repr] = {
    var m = Map[K, Builder[A, Repr]]()
    for (elem <- this) {
      val key = f(elem)
      val bldr = m get key match {
        case None => val b = newBuilder; m = m updated (key, b); b
        case Some(b) => b
      }
      bldr += elem
    }
    m map { case (k, b) => (k, b.result) }
  }
{code}
Independently of that, I don't think it matters that much if it's slower.  People who care can write their own.  The ship sailed when the decision was made to put immutable.Map in the default namespace.  It is more important to interoperate smoothly with your own choices for defaults than it is to deliver maximum efficiency.
(In r22260) Changed groupBy to return immutable.Map.  Closes SI-3550, review by odersky.
