= problem =

Collections have the methods

{code}
drop, dropWhile (from the left)
dropRight       (from the right)
{code}

but there is no {{dropRightWhile}}, no complete symmetry
of dropping from the left or from the right. why not?

The same is true for the method "take": {{take, takeWhile, takeRight}}, but no {{takeRightWhile}}

= suggestion =

SeqLike has the twins  
{code}
indexWhere( p: (A) => Boolean ) : Int
lastIndexWhere( p: (A) => Boolean ) : Int
{code}
so you could define

{code}
def takeRightWhile( p: (A) => Boolean ) = drop ( lastIndexWhere( !p(_) ) + 1 )
{code}
