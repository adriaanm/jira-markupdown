Unreachable Code Errors are currently only emitted for unreachable {{case}} statements in a pattern match (I hope I'm right). Should I close the ticket to "wontfix", or does anybody want to have a look at it?

{code}
  case class S(s: Int)
  val value = S(2)
  def m2: Unit = value match {
    case S(_) => println("an S")
    case S(2) => println("two")
  }


t0712.scala:9: error: unreachable code
    case S(2) => println("two")
{code}
