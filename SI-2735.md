I have to automatically create a lot of JNDI environment variables like the following: 

<Environment name={key} value={value} type="java.lang.String" override="false" />

Now no matter what I do, Scala will always put the "name" attribute last, i.e. change attribute ordering and also expand my empty tag. I searched the mailing list for a solution to the expanding problem, but in Snapshot 2.8.0 there doesn't seem to be an easy one. The end result is this:

<Environment value={value} type="java.lang.String" override="false" name={key}></Environment>

Now I'd love to have the attribute order preserved, as scanning  variables (with my human eyes :) ) by the "name" attribute in a jndi config file is a very common thing to do. I can live with the tag expansion, even though it adds a bit of bloat and wonder why Scala expands my empty tag in the first place: I would write down the expanded version if I wanted to.

Thanks guys!




I would love some information about the current state of this issue. My Scala world sort of revolves around XML documents, transforming XML into new XML or into HTML. I really need attribute ordering preservation desperately.

Anti-xml does not look to strive to backward compatibility so for my current projects I am afraid it is not an option. Is the XML handling by the compiler (literals, matching) pluggable at all?

To be honest, although the API is a bit odd at places scala.xml suits most of my needs. If only this issue would be fixed I would be quite happy to keep using it.

If I had to guess I would think it would take little more than replacing a HashMap with a LinkedHashMap or something like that. Is this issue currently assigned to anyone at all?

"Preserve attribute order" is done in inline xml, but the following code does not preserve attribute order: xml.XML.save("out.xml", xml.XML.load("in.xml"))
