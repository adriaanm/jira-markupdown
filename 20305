Trying to compile specified file results an error:
[error] The argument types of an anonymous function must be fully known. (SLS 8.5)
[error] Expected type was: ?
[error]   a.overloadedF[Int]{

If you omit type parameter in method invocation or remove second overloaded function, everything works fine.
