On ticket scala/bug#1801 the reporter noticed that there was code in the execute methods on Scheduler that detect if the call is made from an FJTaskRunner thread and, if so, use a optimized path to submit the task.  I think this logic is better placed in FJTaskScheduler2.  That way the tight coupling to the FJ* classes is more isolated, and if code uses FJTaskScheduler2 directly rather than through Scheduler it will still benefit from the optimization.
