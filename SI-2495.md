When using ``raw strings" (the ones starting and ending with three double quotes), the coloring doesn't work:

val s = """|Hi,
	   |freaks!""".stripMargin // Comment

Here, `"""..."""' should be displayed blue, `".stripMargin"' black, and `// Comment' green.

Summarizing, there are three Scala specialties that affect coloring, neither of which work:

1. Symbols

2. Nested Comments

3. Raw Strings
I must add a fourth specialty:

4. Verbatim identifiers in back ticks.

The following isn't correctly colored either:

val `a'a` = 2
