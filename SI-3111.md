Consider the following:

```scala
val bool: Boolean = false
bool match {
  case true => "true!"
}
```

Expectation:  I'd hope for a non-exhaustive match warning.
Actual result: run-time MatchError

Likewise for:

```scala
val bool: Boolean = true
bool match {
  case true => "true!"
  case false => "false!"
  case _ => "cats and dogs living together... mass hysteria!"
}
```

Expectation: I would expect to receive an unreachable code error. 
Actual: Silent, happy, deluded compiler.

Tested on 2.8.0 nightly as of Feb 26, 2010.
The new pattern matcher should deliver this. It already checks exhaustiveness for booleans, reachability isn't quite there yet.

Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val b: Boolean = false
b: Boolean = false

scala> b match { case false => true }
<console>:9: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: true
              b match { case false => true }
              ^
res0: Boolean = true

scala> b match { case true => true; case false => false; case _ => true }
res1: Boolean = false
```
