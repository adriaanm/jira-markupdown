zipWithIndex (just like map) should return an Option.

This is what I expected:
val x = Some("asdf")
val y: Option[(String, Int)] = x.zipWithIndex

This is what I got:
val x = Some("asdf")
val y: Iterable[(String, Int)] = x.zipWithIndex

The docs also state this:
zipWithIndex: Option[(A, Int)] 
This is a consequence of the implicit conversion from Option to a collection.  Zipping with an index is a pretty non-Option-like thing to do (it's equivalent to `x.map(y => (y,0))`), so it's not a bug that it isn't on Option itself.  Whether the implicit conversion itself is wise is another issue, but for *this* issue things are working as intended.
The ticket on the Scaladoc being wrong here is #8394.
