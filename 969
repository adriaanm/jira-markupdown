(In r23026) Fixed long standing annoyance which prevents the same source file
from being used as both a script and a program.  If a script has
only a single top level object with a main method, then that is
the object to which arguments will be passed.  (Contrast with the
current situation, where a wrapper object is wrapped around it and
the script will never do anything since there is nothing which can
reference the object.)

So now you can do this:

% cat script.scala
object FiddleDeeMain {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(args mkString " ")
  }
}
% scala -nocompdaemon script.scala a b c
a b c
% scala script.scala a b c
a b c
% scalac script.scala
% scala FiddleDeeMain a b c
a b c

Closes scala/bug#1173, review by community.
