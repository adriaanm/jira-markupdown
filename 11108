minimized (this one needs to be compiled without {{-optimise}} otherwise the bug is optimized away, but with {{-target:jvm-1.7}})
```scala
class C {
  def apply(x: Boolean) = new Tuple2(null, {
    while (x) { }
    null
  })
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = println(new C())
}
```

gives
```
  public scala.Tuple2<scala.runtime.Null$, scala.runtime.Null$> apply(boolean);
    Signature: (Z)Lscala/Tuple2;
    Code:
       0: new           #12                 // class scala/Tuple2
       3: dup           
       4: aconst_null   
       5: iload_1       
       6: ifne          5
       9: aconst_null   
      10: invokespecial #16                 // Method scala/Tuple2."<init>":(Ljava/lang/Object;Ljava/lang/Object;)V
      13: areturn       
```

the `ifne` is not allowed, because it jumps to a previous location, and the stack at this location contains an uninitialized object (the Tuple2 reference has been created with `new`, but its constructor has not yet been invoked). See last paragraph in http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.2.4.
