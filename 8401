This was fixed by the new completion in 2.11.8.

It used to appear under double-tab, null.<tab><tab> or "".<tab><tab>

The previous backend error, on an attempt to use $asInstanceOf, was
{code}
should have been unboxed by erasure: "".$asInstanceOf[Int]()
{code}
and is now
{code}
Erasure should have added an unboxing operation to prevent this cast. Tree: "".$asInstanceOf[Int]()
{code}
