if a parameter to a constructor has the same name as the field of a parent class, that fields getter doesn't show up in calls to {{Type.members}}:

{code:scala}
import scala.reflect.runtime.{universe => ru}
class A(var x: Int)
class B(x:Int, var y: Int) extends A(x)
scala> ru.typeOf[B].members.filter{_.name.toString.contains("x")}
res23: Iterable[reflect.runtime.universe.Symbol] = SynchronizedOps(value x, method x_=)
{code}

(notice that "method x", the getter, is missing.)

This only seems to be happening because the constructor for B has a parameter named "x" also.  Normally, {{members}} does return inherited getters.

Maybe it is trying to be broken in the same way as real life. See SI-3194, SI-4762, etc
And SI-6880, don't miss that one. It's not realistic to expect reflection to make much sense when the model upon which it is reflecting makes so little itself.
