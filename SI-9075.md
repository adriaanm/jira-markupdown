In Scala 2.11, the TracersableOnce[T].sum method is defined as follows:

   def sum[B >: A](implicit num: Numeric[B]): B = foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)

This might look well until you try to sum, say, durations. Summing durations is pretty legal, since there is a defined associative operation plus and there is a zero element, which is all what is needed in the sum method. However, scala.math.Numeric[T] requires to also implement some other methods.

This is not just a theoretical restriction, because I can't properly implement `(_: Duration).times(_: Duration): Duration`. When multiplying time duration by another time duration, I get a "square duration", whatever it means. As a result, I can either use an invalid implementation (e.g. `def times(d: Duration) = ???`) or I can completely resign on TraversableOnce[Duration].sum. None of these is ideal.

I suggest creating a more fine-grained hierarchy, e.g. scala.math.Monoid[T]. Requiring just a monoid seems to be enough for the sum method and removes the insane requirements.
