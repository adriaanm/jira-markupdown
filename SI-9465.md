I'm trying to get Apache Spark (written in Scala) {{org.apache.spark:spark-core_2.10:1.2.1}} to load properly in the javac compiler and I get a problem related to local classes and {{InnerClass}} attributes.

Here are the relevant bits of javap output to show the problem. This class says it's a local class, belonging to the constructor of {{Accumulators$}}


{noformat}
Classfile jar:file:/home/stephane/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.10/1.2.1/spark-core_2.10-1.2.1.jar!/org/apache/spark/Accumulators$$anon$1.class
[...]
  EnclosingMethod: #8.#11                 // org.apache.spark.Accumulators$.<init>
  InnerClasses:
       public static #2 of #38; //class org/apache/spark/Accumulators$$anon$1 of class org/apache/spark/Accumulators

{noformat}

Now, this class lists it as an inner class or {{Accumulators}}:


{noformat}
Classfile jar:file:/home/stephane/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.10/1.2.1/spark-core_2.10-1.2.1.jar!/org/apache/spark/Accumulators.class
[...]
  InnerClasses:
       public static #57 of #2; //class org/apache/spark/Accumulators$$anon$1 of class org/apache/spark/Accumulators

{noformat}

And this class too:


{noformat}
Classfile jar:file:/home/stephane/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.10/1.2.1/spark-core_2.10-1.2.1.jar!/org/apache/spark/Accumulators$.class
[...]
  InnerClasses:
       public static #156 of #159; //class org/apache/spark/Accumulators$$anon$1 of class org/apache/spark/Accumulators

{noformat}

The JVMLS says of the {{InnerClasses}} attribute (from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.6):

"outer_class_info_index
If C is not a member of a class or an interface (that is, *if C is* a top-level class or interface (JLS ยง7.6) or *a local class* (JLS ยง14.3) or an anonymous class (JLS ยง15.9.5)), *the value of the outer_class_info_index item must be zero*."

So I _think_ the {{InnerClasses}} attributes are wrong in specifying an outer class. It confuses javac at the very least, causing it to throw completion failures when introspecting the class.
