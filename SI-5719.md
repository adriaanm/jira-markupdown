Utilizing JTree within Scala (JTree is it's own problem!) and came across this issue.

Context: In Java, a class named jdcMutableTreeNode extends javax.swing.tree.DefaultMutableTreeNode (to solve an unrelated issue).  Then in Scala, the WrapTreeNode extends jdcMutableTreeNode (and provides most of the logic for the application).

This Scala code:
```
        val treeNodes = model.getPathToRoot(this)
        val path = new TreePath(treeNodes)
        tree.expandPath(path)

throws this Exception (at tree.expandPath):

Couldn't quite figure out where the **[Ljavax.swing.tree.TreeNode** type came from.  If I stop it in the Eclipse debugger, everything looks as expected (path is listed as a TreePath by Eclipse, but also shows [[Ljavax.swing.tree.TreeNode;@88fdaf] if you click on TreePath in the Value pane).

Anyway, as a workaround added this method in Java, invoked it instead of the above code, and it works as expected.  (The **tree.isCollapsed(path)** was omitted from the Scala code above just so I could force the Exception.  In the original Scala code it was present and worked OK.)

```
  /** From Scala kept getting a weird class case Exception                    */
  public void makeSureNodeExpanded(JTree tree, DefaultTreeModel model, jdcMutableTreeNode node){
    TreePath path = new TreePath(model.getPathToRoot(node));
    if(tree.isCollapsed(path))
      tree.expandPath(path);
  }
```

Some additional information.  Ran this code:

```
    val nodes = model.getPathToRoot(this)
    val pathBad = new TreePath(nodes)
    val pathTry = new javax.swing.tree.TreePath(nodes)
    val path = this.getTreePath(tree.getJTree, model, this)
```

and this is what appears in the Variables pane of Eclipse Debug:

```
this	WrapTreeNode  (id=53)	
nodes	TreeNode[1]  (id=54)	
	[0]	WrapTreeNode  (id=53)	
pathBad	TreePath  (id=62)	
	lastPathComponent	TreeNode[1]  (id=54)	
	parentPath	null	
pathTry	TreePath  (id=64)	
	lastPathComponent	TreeNode[1]  (id=54)	
	parentPath	null	
path	TreePath  (id=71)	
	lastPathComponent	WrapTreeNode  (id=53)	
	parentPath	null	

```

**nodes** has the value as expected (an array of 1 WrapTreeNode -- which is my extension of a TreeNode)

**path** at the end is correct.  getTreePath is a Java routine which does just **return new TreePath(model.getPathToRoot(node));**  Notice that the **lastPathComponent** is a simple WrapTreeNode instance

**pathBad** is executing the **new TreePath(nodes)** in Scala.  It sets up lastPathComponent as an **array** with one TreeNode element.

**pathTry** was to verify that we were getting the javax.swing.tree.TreePath constructor (instead of a similarly named TreePath from somewhere else) - but it results in the same thing.

Am I missing something here?  It seems to be a problem with the **new TreePath(...)** constructor when executed in Scala.  Am I missing a case or something?  (But no compiler warnings or errors were issued.)
Whoo-whee, that was interesting.

This is damage inflicted by a combination of lossy java interop and the insanity of constructors which take "Object", which isn't so hot in any language.

Notice that TreePath has two public constructors:

  TreePath(Object lastPathComponent)
  TreePath(Object[] path)

So what happens if you say

  new TreePath(Array("abc"))

Overloading resolution has to choose a constructor.  An Array[String] is not an Array[Object] (arrays are not covariant, not in this language) so it chooses the Object constructor, which of course an Array is.

Were there no Object constructor, the expression would not typecheck as Array[String] and the inferencer would choose Array[Object].  But as it is, it's just following orders.

You can work around this by specifying the type.

  new TreePath(Array[Object]("abc"))

or whatever the equivalent is in your code.
```
scala> val x1 = new TreePath(Array("abc"))
x1: javax.swing.tree.TreePath = [[Ljava.lang.String;@77c16c5f]

scala> val x2 = new TreePath(Array[Object]("abc"))
x2: javax.swing.tree.TreePath = [abc]
```
