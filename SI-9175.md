Seems `mutable.Queue` only has batch enqueuing:

http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.mutable.Queue@enqueue%28elems:A*%29:Unit

which tends to be slower than a combination of two enqueues, one for a single element and one for batches:

http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Queue@enqueue%5BB%3E:A%5D%28iter:scala.collection.immutable.Iterable%5BB%5D%29:scala.collection.immutable.Queue%5BB%5D

http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Queue@enqueue%5BB%3E:A%5D%28elem:B%29:scala.collection.immutable.Queue%5BB%5D

How do you feel about adding an enqueue to the mutable Queue?
I think it's really a shame that {{mutable.Queue}} doesn't have this, so if you can do it in a source-compatible way, that sounds good to me!  However, something like {{.enqueue(xs: _*)}} would still need to work to maintain source compatibility.  Adriaan is the one to ask if we want a performance vs. backwards compatibility tradeoff.  (I think an implicit will do the trick, but it's a bit ugly to have in the API...maybe better to just wait until 2.13 and fix it properly.)
[~ichoran], what about adding signatures like:

{code:scala}
def enqueue[B >: A](elem: B): Unit
@deprecated(...) def enqueue[B >: A](elem: B, elem2: B, elems: B*): Unit
def enqueue[B >: A](iter: Iterable[B]): Unit
{code}

Unless I'm not missing some corner case, that would keep source compatibility and pave the path to an unified API for enqueuing in 2.13 - a single-element enqueue and an iterator enqueue.

[~ruippeixotog] Well, there's the empty case, `enqueue()`, though I can't imagine why that would have been used.  And if anyone extended `mutable.Queue` this definitely requires a good bit of work to retain compatibility.  But it's not a bad idea.  Maybe worth moving it up to 2.12 and seeing who complains?  Maybe after we survey projects out there and see how often if ever we see `mutable.Queue` extended.
On a second look, my suggestion breaks also code that calls `enqueue` as `enqueue(elemSeq: _*)`. Maybe there is no way to do that without breaking source compatibility... how about defining `+=` for single-element enqueues?
