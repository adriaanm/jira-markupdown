 In interactive.Global, method `newRunnerThread` always waits for a `scheduler.waitForMoreWork()` before `pollForWork()`, which may causes all raised `except`s never have chance to be polled, if there is no more `WorkItem` in `todo` queue.

I can override askShutdown() and askReset() as following code to force the runner thread poll a awake action:

{code}
  /**
   * In interactive.Global, the `newRunnerThread` always waits for `scheduler.waitForMoreWork()`
   * before `pollForWork()`, which may cause raised `except`s never have chance to be polled, if
   * there is no more `WorkItem` in `todo` queue, so I have to post another Action to awake it.
   * @Ticket SI-2289
   */
  override def askShutdown() = {
    scheduler.raise(new ShutdownReq)
    scheduler postWorkItem {() => println("A action to awake scheduler to process shutdown except")}
  }

  override def askReset() = {
    scheduler.raise(new FreshRunReq)
    scheduler postWorkItem {() => println("A action to awake scheduler to process reset except")}
  }

{code}

But, for "shudown", the loop seems not working, I think the proper approach to stop a thread should be something like:
{code}
  /** Create a new presentation compiler runner.
   */
  def newRunnerThread: Thread = new Thread("Scala Presentation Compiler") {
    override def run() {
      try {
        while (true) {
          scheduler.waitForMoreWork()
          pollForWork()
          while (outOfDate) {
            try {
              backgroundCompile()
              outOfDate = false
            } catch {
              case ex: FreshRunReq =>
            }
          }
        }
      } catch {
        case ex: InterruptedException =>
          Thread.currentThread.interrupt // interrupt again to avoid posible out-loop issue
        case ex: ShutdownReq =>
          Thread.currentThread.interrupt
        case ex => 
          outOfDate = false
          compileRunner = newRunnerThread
          ex match { 
            case _ : ValidateError => // This will have been reported elsewhere
            case _ => ex.printStackTrace(); inform("Fatal Error: "+ex)
          }
      }
    }
    start()
  }
{code}
From the doc comment of askShutdown(): "Tell the compile server to shutdown, and do not restart again", that means, after the raised ShutdownReq Exception processed, the newRunnerThread should be stopped totally. 

But the original code will just catch this Exception and won't interrupt it, that is, the newRunnerThread's code loop will continue. 

On the contrast,  the patched code will call Thread.currentThread.interrupt to truly stop this thread.

Another:
{code}
case ex: InterruptedException =>
          Thread.currentThread.interrupt // interrupt again to avoid posible out-loop issue
{code}
is an usual way to ensure interrupt working even under some cases of out-loop.

The loop won't continue: the catch is outside the loop body.


The loop will continue, since the exception is **catched**, so nothing will happen. I also debugged these code carefully.
It's caught, so the following statements in try:

{code}
      while (true) {
          scheduler.waitForMoreWork()
          pollForWork()
          while (outOfDate) {
            try {
              backgroundCompile()
              outOfDate = false
            } catch {
              case ex: FreshRunReq =>
            }
          }
        }
{code}

won't be interrupted, it's still there and running, although it's named "ShutdownReq", there's no difference from throwing any other Exceptions.
You're mistaken. The exception is thrown from within the body of the loop and caught outside the loop, the thread then terminates ... there's no possibility of the loop being restarted within the same thread.

Compare with the following simplified but structurally similar example,

{code}
try {
  while(true) {
    throw new RuntimeException
  }
} catch {
  case ex : RuntimeException =>
}

println("Done")
{code}

The loop cannot and will not be reentered following the catch of the thrown exception. "Done" will always be printed.

It's possible that within your debug session you're seeing a subsequent incarnation of the runner thread, but that would be via a completely different mechanism.
You are right at the reenter scene. I evaluated and thought the code again, and found the issue is from a ResetReq followed by a ShutdownReq, below is a test code:

{code}
package interruptthread

import scala.util.control.ControlException

object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) :Unit = {
    newRunThread
    println("stopped")
  }

  var outOfDate = true
  def newRunThread: Thread = new Thread("running thread") {
    try {
      while(true) {
        println("running")
        reset
        shutdown
        while (outOfDate) {
          println("running inner loop")
        }
      }
    } catch {
      case ex : ShutdownReq =>
      case ex => 
        outOfDate = false
        newRunThread
    }
    
    start
  }

  def shutdown = throw new ShutdownReq
  def reset = throw new ResetReq

  class ShutdownReq extends Exception with ControlException
  class ResetReq extends Exception with ControlException

}
{code}

The above code won't stop. But the patched like code will stop properly.
Yup, I think we're on the same page at last :-)

I've looked at the logic here closely and in fact I can't see an obvious indication of a race between FreshRunReq and ShutdownReq.

Note that the catching and handling of either of these will be the last action of the current runner thread.

Since this is the only thread that is dequeuing exceptions, then if a ShutdownReq is handled, any pending FreshRunReq's will be ignored.

Alternatively, if a FreshRunReq is handled, then a new runner thread will be created and the old thread will terminate without dequeuing any further exceptions. So any pending ShutdownReq will still be on the queue, hence the new runner thread will eventually dequeue it and shutdown.

Your example code in comment SI-13 behaves different, because it doesn't exhibit the same queuing behaviour.

So if there is a problem with askShutdown, I'm fairly confident this isn't it.

Can you give me some more detail about the behaviour you're observing?
