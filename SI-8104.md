```scala
import scala.reflect.macros.WhiteboxContext

object Macros {
  def impl[T](c: WhiteboxContext)(implicit T: c.WeakTypeTag[T]) = {
    import c.universe._
    import definitions._
    val fields = T.tpe.declarations.toList.collect{ case x: TermSymbol if x.isVal && x.isCaseAccessor => x }
    val Repr = appliedType(TupleClass(fields.length).asType.toType, fields.map(_.typeSignature))
    q"new Generic[$T]{ type Repr = $Repr }"
  }
}
```

```scala
trait Generic[T] { type Repr }
object Generic {
  type Aux[T, Repr0] = Generic[T] { type Repr = Repr0 }
  import scala.language.experimental.macros
  implicit def materializeGeneric[T]: Generic[T] = macro Macros.impl[T]
}

object Test extends App {
  case class C(x: Int, y: Int)

  // does work: the implicit is materialized and Repr is successfully inferred as (Int, Int)
  def reprify[T, Repr](x: T)(implicit generic: Generic.Aux[T, Repr]) = ???
  reprify(C(40, 2))

  // doesn't work: can't find implicit value for parameter e: Generic.Aux[Test.C,(Int, Int)]
  // implicitly[Generic.Aux[C, (Int, Int)]]
}
```

upd. Note that the original bug report looked differently, involving an anonymous class that inherited from a class that takes an implicit of type Generic.Aux. However, it all boiled down to a very simple reproduction, so I decided to update the description. Therefore if initial comments look confusing to you, don't worry - it's okay. If you really wonder about what was going on, take a look at the issue's history.
Boy, I scratched my head a while before realizing there must be a macro involved. That is pretty uncool that it can so easily masquerade as normal source (although I guess that's a "feature".) The bug is in the macro code. When the compiler is inferring type arguments it widens anonymous classes for exactly this reason. 
```scala
object Generic extends LowPriorityGeneric {
  type Aux[T, Repr0] = Generic[T] { type Repr = Repr0 }

  // Refinement for products, here we can provide the calling context with
  // a proof that the resulting Repr <: HList
  implicit def product[T <: Product]: Generic[T] = macro GenericMacros.materializeForProduct[T]
}
```
By the way, anonymous classes don't have anything to do with this bug. Replacing `new A((1, 'b')) {}` with `class X extends A[(Int, Char),shapeless.::[Int,shapeless.::[Char,shapeless.HNil]]]((1, 'b'))` leads to the same compilation error

```scala

This is how this problem manifests itself in shapeless:

```
import shapeless._ 
object Test extends App { 
  implicitly[Generic.Aux[(Int, Char), Int :: Char :: HNil]] 
} 

[error] ~/Projects/shapeless-test/Test.scala:3: could not find implicit value for parameter e: shapeless.Generic.Aux[(Int, Char),shapeless.::[Int,shapeless.::[Char,shapeless.HNil]]] 
[error] implicitly[Generic.Aux[(Int, Char), Int :: Char :: HNil]] 
[error] ^ 
```

This happens because of [matchesPt](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/9f0594c57716ed551918e15be6da843982e8ba12/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Implicits.scala#L486) discarding [Generic.product](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/blob/dddf09f9d37aa29cbee90ef93c7fb57c0eed25af/core/src/main/scala/shapeless/generic.scala#L40) as an implicit candidate for a lookup for [Generic\[T1\] \{ type Repr = T2 \}](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/blob/dddf09f9d37aa29cbee90ef93c7fb57c0eed25af/core/src/main/scala/shapeless/generic.scala#L25) with both T1 and T2 being ground types:

```
matchesPt(
  => Generic[?]{type Repr <: HList},                     // signature of Generic.product
  Generic.Aux[(Int, Char), ::[Int, ::[Char, HNil]]], Nil // expected type
) == false
```

This is quite reasonable, because the Repr type member ruins the subtyping check underlying matchesPt. Repr's counterpart, the T type parameter of Generic, gets wildcarded for the matchesPt check (denoted by the question mark in the printout), whereas Repr does not.
I have no idea whether there's a principled solution here, since I have only superficial knowledge of how type inference is supposed to work, but luckily there's a very simple workaround that involves converting latent whiteboxity of Generic to explicit whiteboxity of Generic.Aux:

```
- implicit def materializeGeneric[T]: Generic[T] = macro Macros.impl[T]
+ implicit def materializeGeneric[T, Repr]: Generic.Aux[T, Repr] = macro Macros.impl[T]
```

This, however, requires 2.11 and is not going to work in 2.10, because fundep materialization was only merged into 2.11 (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2499).
