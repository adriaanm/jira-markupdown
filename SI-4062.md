With 2.8.1-final, code:

```scala
class A(val f : String)

class B(a : Option[String], f : String) extends A(f) {
  a match {
    case Some(`f`) => print(f)
  }
}
```

Causes the compiler to throw `scala.MatchError: B.super.f().asInstanceOf[java.lang.String]`

I think this code ought to compile. It seems to be upset that `Some(`f`)` refers to the constructor argument f which is shadowing the inherited val f.
I believe this bug is actually in superaccessors, in transformSuperSelect.
```scala
  if (sym.isModule && !sym.isMethod) {
    // the super accessor always needs to be a method. See SI-231
    superAccTpe = PolyType(List(), superAccTpe)
  }
```
It looks like this is being performed even on the pattern itself, but it isn't eliminated in uncurry and a TypeApply tree reaches the pattern matcher where it shouldn't.

I'll take it for now since I don't know who else would, but it won't fight anyone who tries to steal it.
(In r23694) Don't transform patterns during superaccessors: the matcher can't deal
with funny trees.  Closes #4062, review by dragos.
