While Finagle is primarily written in Scala, we support Java users as well. The lack of byte code support for JVM's protected visibility and default (package) visibility is limiting. 

We'd love support for these, perhaps via an annotation. A sketch of what it might look like:

```scala
import scala.annotation.{Modifier, Visibility}

@Visibility(Modifier.Default)
def method1(): Unit = ()

@Visibility(Modifier.Protected)
def method2(): Unit = ()
```
Yeah, this is something we should support. We're also limited by our lack of expressiveness in the bytecode visibility department, as that is how we define binary compatibility. Not sure I'd go with an annotation (since they're not supposed to influence semantics like that). It's a tricky design problem... We could provide something under a flag as a stopgap.

The problem in compiling visibility to bytecode modifiers when qualifying visibility with a package lies with our notion of package nesting, whereas Java does not consider packages `a.foo` and `a.bar` related in any way. For example, this compiles:

```scala
package a { private[a] class A }
// [fastforward ten years] you add:
package a.sub { private[a] class B extends a.A } // compiles
```

To be honest, we've kind of been hoping Java 9's module system would take care of this for us, but I would love to fix this if we can find a reasonable way.

Yep, I totally get that. And I think that is why Scala can't simply translate `private\[a\]` into default visibility. Thus my annotation proposal. If there is another keyword or way this can be indicated to Scalac, that'd be great. I'm not at all tied to using annotations. It was intended to be illustrative.

```
As for protected, aren't protected and protected\[this\] in scala at least as strict as protected in java?
So in those cases it would be possible to emit a protected modifier?
```

Agreed, I believe it orthogonal to default visibility. My annotation proposal was crafted in the interest of backwards compatibility. As mentioned above, I have zero attachment to it being done this specific way.

Perhaps I should have filed these as separate tickets, but I didn't know enough about the compiler to have a good sense.
