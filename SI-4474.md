currently Option only has flatten via implicit conversion to Iterable, so:
{code}
scala> Some(Some(3)).flatten
res4: Iterable[Int] = List(3)
{code}
I was hoping to get Some(3) back, not List(3).

flatten (or join, I don't have an opinion on the right name) seems like an essential operation to have on monadic types like Option.

see also SI-661. it was closed as wontfix, but I think that's because Tony was suggesting adding lots of methods, not just this one.

Is this expected behaviour?

Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0.r25217-b20110702020235 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_24).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val o = Some(Seq(1,2,3))
o: Some[Seq[Int]] = Some(List(1, 2, 3))

scala> o.flatten
<console>:9: error: Cannot prove that Seq[Int] <:< Option[B].
              o.flatten
                ^
{noformat} 


"workaround":
{noformat} 
scala> o.toList.flatten
res1: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)
{noformat} 
Pretty much expected.  It's within the realm of possibility that someday it will, after realizing that the flatten on Option is ineligible, find the flatten on Iterable available after implicitly converting Option.  But I wouldn't bet on it.  Option is never going to fit seamlessly in with the collections, since it isn't one.
