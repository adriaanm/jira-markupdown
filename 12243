This sounds like an `sbt` feature to me, rather than a `scalac` feature.

This is also a little risky -- to print the errors in reverse order, you'd have to buffer them all in memory until the compile run finished. If the process crashed or was killed, then you'd lose all diagnostic info. The current approach of printing errors as soon as they occur at least means that the compiler can be killed without losing info if the user doesn't want to wait for the run to finish.
