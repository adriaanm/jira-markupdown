would you agree this illustrates the same issue, but with less code?

```
class W[T <: AnyRef](val f: T) {
  type F = f.type
  type SelfW = W[T] { type F = W.this.F }
  def error(w: SelfW) = w.f: w.F
}

S.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : w.f.type (with underlying type T)
 required: w.F
    (which expands to)  W.this.f.type
  def error(w: SelfW) = w.f: w.F
                          ^
one error found
```

Hmm, now I'm wondering.... are you actually saying your original code should compile, or are you just reporting that the error message is confusing?

The error message is confusing, I'll give you that. But I very much doubt that your code is correct. I think you may have an incorrect idea of what it means to "override" a type in a type alias. Scala will let you write e.g.:

```scala
trait A { type T = Int ; def f: T = 3 }
type U = A { type T = String }
```

but that doesn't mean that in U, you have somehow changed the type of f. The type of f is still Int.

By the same token, in your code you write:

```scala
type Self = W { type F = outer.F }
```

but that doesn't mean that if I have a value w of type Self, def w.selfF is constrained to be outer.F!
The type `T` in your example is a concrete type, while the type `Self` and `F` in my original example are abstract types.

Scalac does change the type in expression `def f: T` so long as `T` is an abstract type. For example:

```scala
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_77).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> trait A { type T; def f: T }
defined trait A

scala> type U = A { type T = String }
defined type alias U

scala> new A { type T = String; def f = "f" }
res0: A{type T = String} = $anon$1@68f7aae2

scala> res0: U
res1: U = $anon$1@68f7aae2

scala> res1.f.substring(0, 1) // res1.f is a String 
res2: String = f
```
