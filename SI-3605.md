The classes in scala.util.parsing.json can only be used for parsing JSON into a domain object. It would be nice if there was a way to serialize JSONObject and JSONArray to a JSON string. Currently the .toString of those classes is a custom representation - I think it would be sufficient to change the .toString to output JSON.

Here's the smallest change possible to enable that. It's not too hard to pretty-print the JSON either - I'll work on this if there's any interest.

```scala
case class JSONObject (obj : Map[Any,Any]) extends JSONType {
  override def toString = "{" + obj.map({ case (k,v) => k + ": " + v }).mkString(", ") + "}"
}

case class JSONArray (list : List[Any]) extends JSONType {
  override def toString = "[" + list.mkString(", ") + "]"
}
```
(In r22648) Modified toString on JSONObject and JSONArray to print JSON

Closes #3605

Relatively minor change to get it working.
(In r23217) Made some adjustments to toString formatting of JSON

Closes #3605

Hopefully this is the last time I have to close this
ticket. In addition to default behavior, the end user
can specify their own JSON value formatting function
if they want to customize it.
