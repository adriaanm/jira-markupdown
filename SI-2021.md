Java documentation on clone method says:

The general intent is that, for any object x, the expression: 

 x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()

By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling super.clone. If a class and all of its superclasses (except Object) obey this convention, it will be the case that x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass().

All clone() implementation disobey this by not calling super.clone, thus it is possible that resulting class will differ. I mean, scala cloning is usually like '= empty ++ elements', but if someone will subclass some collection, the clone method will return an object of superclass.
Do you have a use case? Not doing this seems like a feature to me. The intended Java cloning semantics are dubious and error prone and not part of the contract of clone, merely suggestions. In particular you missed out an important chunk of the documentation:

```scala
The general intent is that, for any object x, the expression:

     x.clone() != x

will be true, and that the expression:

     x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()

will be true, but these are not absolute requirements. 
```
Replying to [comment:2 DRMacIver]:
> Do you have a use case?
For example:
```scala
scala> val m = new scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[String,String] { override def default(s:String) = "none" }
m: scala.collection.mutable.HashMap[String,String] = Map()

scala> m("a")
res1: String = none

scala> val c = m.clone
c: scala.collection.mutable.Map[String,String] = Map()

scala> c("a")
java.util.NoSuchElementException: key not found: a
```

Actually, in my alternative HashMap implementation http://github.com/alex14n/CompactHashMap java-style cloning is more convenient (I have many `private[this]` fields and I all need is to clone couple of arrays), and I'm afraid that having clone() defined in new 2.8 traits will break it.
Unfortunately, changing cloning convention at this point would be too risky because of the potential for very-hard-to-find bugs due to the change in semantics.
