According to the documentation, `receiveWithin` should block at most `msec` milliseconds
if no message matches any of the cases of the partial function passed as argument.

This is not correct if the function is not defined on `TIMEOUT` and if the msec argument
is > 0.

The function
```scala
def main(args: Array[String]){
	Actor.receiveWithin(0) {
		case str: String => println(str)
	}
}
```
throws an "unhandled timeout" `RuntimeException`, however 
```scala
def main(args: Array[String]){
	Actor.receiveWithin(1) {
		case str: String => println(str)
	}
}
```
blocks indefinitely. The `TIMEOUT` object is stored in the mailbox after the timeout, but it remains there as it is not consumed.
Actually a new `TIMEOUT` object is added to the mailbox after each additional `msec` milliseconds.

The function `receiveWithin` defines the local function `receiveTimeout` which checks, whether the function is defined at `TIMEOUT`, but this function is only called if `msec == 0L`.
