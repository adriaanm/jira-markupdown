```scala
sealed abstract class Resolution
case object FiveMinuteResolution extends Resolution
case object HourResolution extends Resolution
case object DayResolution extends Resolution
case object WeekResolution extends Resolution
case object MonthResolution extends Resolution

object Resolution {
  private val fiveMinute = "5minute"
  private val hour = "hour"
  private val day = "day"
  private val week = "week"
  private val month = "month"
  val possibleResolutions = Seq[String](fiveMinute, hour, day, week, month)

  def parseStringToResolution(str: String): Resolution = {   
      str match {
        case fiveMinute => FiveMinuteResolution
        case hour => HourResolution
        case day => DayResolution
        case week => WeekResolution
        case month => MonthResolution
      }
  }
}
```

The above code produces a compiler error on the match suggesting that there is unreachable code.  If I replace the match with the following code it works as expected.

```scala

    if (str == fiveMinute)
      FiveMinuteResolution
    else if (str == hour)
      HourResolution
    else if (str == week)
      WeekResolution
    else if (str == month)
      MonthResolution
    else
      throw new IllegalArgumentException
```
