Also, here's quote from [Java spec](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/classes.html#8.1.2):
```
It is a compile-time error if a generic class is a direct or indirect subclass of Throwable.
```

That's why code above compiles; `javac` doesn't even bother to check if an exception declared in `throws` is polymorphic because it assumes that can never happen.
