In an upgrade to 2.8.0, I noticed a bunch of errors where references to inner classes triggered errors -- despite being legal Java, despite not causing problems in an ant build using 2.8.0prebeta1.  Here is a small example, attached as a zip file of a small project (three Java files in a Scala project) demonstrating (I hope) how this goes wrong.

The offending file/line is GHashMap.java, line 104, with the reference to !WrappedKey "not found".  !WrappedKey is defined on line 38 (and F3 will take you there!).  Notice other mentions of !WrappedKey that do not cause problems to be reported.  Qualifying it explicitly did not help, at least for me.

Everything involved is up-to-date as of earlier today, March 2.

This is the most boring code I could find that would exhibit this problem.  It does not seem to be directly referenced from any Scala code in the larger project from which it was extracted.
I'm seeing the same problem in my project with:
Eclipse Version: 3.5.2, Build id: M20100211-1343
Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r21046-b20100303040037

Here's a more minimal error case (place in package test):
```scala
package test;

public class Test {
	public static interface TestInterface{}
	public Test(TestInterface ti){}
}
```

Note that if the constructor arg type is changed to Test.TestInterface, then the build completes properly.
I tried that fix in my example, I get (cut/paste from Eclipse)
```scala
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
type WrappedKey is not a member of object GHashMap	GHashMap.java	/Bug/src	line 104	Scala Problem
```
where the line in question reads
```scala
        this(hasher, new HashMap<WrappedKey, V>());
```

So your revised example, strictly speaking, is too minimal.
Scratch that previous "line in question", I copy/pasted the wrong one.  THIS line:
```scala
    private GHashMap(Hasher<K> hasher, HashMap<GHashMap.WrappedKey, V> map) {
```

I've tinkered with adding type parameters to GHashMap, no luck.
FYI, here's the workaround that works for me:
```scala
    private GHashMap(Hasher<K> hasher, HashMap map) {
        this.hasher = hasher;
        this.map = (HashMap<GHashMap.WrappedKey, V>) map;
    }
```
(Yuck.)
