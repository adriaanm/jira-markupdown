If we try to run an abstract class as a JUnit test, the JUnit launcher executes the class instead of reporting "No JUnit tests found" which is the expected behavior. This is problimatic, no only because it is incompatible with JDT, but because if we try to run multiple JUnit tests (by selecting a package or source folder) if there are abstract JUnit tests they fail with a java.lang.!InstantiationException.

Tested with: r29638.
(In r20674) Make sure Eclipse elements are marked as abstract where appropriate. Fixes SI-2962. Review by community.
Miles,

a HUGE thanks for fixing SI-2962 and SI-2952 so quickly!
