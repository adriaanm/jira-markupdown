This PR fixes quasiquotes by making them treat q"val (x: T) = v" the same as q"val x: T = v" (i.e. compile-time check). The primary parser stays unchanged but now both of them will agree on this matter even though it will stay broken in 2.11.

Change to the Scala parser scheduled for 2.12 is a different bug: scala/bug#8211.
