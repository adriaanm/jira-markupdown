I can't spot the connection between the change in Slick you linked to and this ticket.

Do we want to rename the class or refactor the code so it's not private anymore?

If it's true that c4341385629bd114b61c55103f1d83f26dce22f9 introduced regression how's possible that I report it 11 months later? Could it be that nobody tried to compile or never got to compiling sbt's {{main}} subproject during last 11 months?
