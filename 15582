While trying the new parallel collections i have discovered some inconsistencies in the results of foldLeft. This example code:

{code}
import scala.collection.parallel.mutable._
val a = ParArray(0 until 10: _*)
for(i <- 0 until 10) println("Should be: " + a.sum + " is: " + a.foldLeft(0)(_+_))
{code}

produces the following output:

{code}
Should be: 45 is: 45
Should be: 45 is: 43
Should be: 45 is: 38
Should be: 45 is: 38
Should be: 45 is: 41
Should be: 45 is: 40
Should be: 45 is: 21
Should be: 45 is: 45
Should be: 45 is: 45
Should be: 45 is: 45
{code}
