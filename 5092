There's only one B - it's B, not B$.  classOf[B] returns B already, that's pretty well fixed.  The problem is that now compilation fails because class B is unknown, because the earlier stage of the compiler isn't aware that genjvm is going to synthesize it.

As it stands, the same source will compile if you compile against bytecode (since the class will have been generated) but not if you compile with pure source.  That's no good.
