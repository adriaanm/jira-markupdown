It seems as if generated Scaladoc documentation doesn't include
comments for lazy vals.

This problem is included in Trac ticket SI-254, which was labelled
closed and fixed in August 2010, as of Scala build r22739.

I have tried generating scaladocs using scala-2.8.final, and a couple of nigthly builds, including r22805, which was the latest build on Aug 23, 2010. Still, the comments for lazy vals aren't included in the generated Scaladocs.

To reproduce, run scaladoc on the example class below. The comment for {{nonLazyString}} will be included in the docs, but there will be no comment for {{lazyString}}.

{code}
class Test {

 /**
  * A lazy String
  */
 lazy val lazyString = "lazy"

 /**
  * A non-lazy String
  */
 val nonLazyString = "non-lazy"

}
{code}
