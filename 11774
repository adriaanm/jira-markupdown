Here's a minimization:
```scala
val b = new scala.collection.mutable.UnrolledBuffer[Int]()
(1 to 15).foreach(i => b append i)
b.insert(0, 16)
b.remove(b.size - 1)
b append 17
b  // 17 appears at index 1 instead of at the end!
```

This works for the entire block from 15 to 32, then doesn't happen again.
