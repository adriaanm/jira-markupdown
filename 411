For the same reason that you can write Some() yet mean Some(()). There's an implicit tupling conversion going on. I don't see what can be done, except change toString
in Atom. I think it's an unfortunate overload (and btw it's not the first time this problem has come up). I refer back to you Burak to decide what to do (maybe dnothing).
