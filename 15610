this should compile:

{code}
object Test {
  type Point = Map[Symbol, String]
  type Points = IndexedSeq[Point]

  def makePoints2: Points = IndexedSeq[Point]()
  val spoints2 = util.Random.shuffle(makePoints2)
}
{code}

instead it gives an error (which itself is buggy):
{code}
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Test.Points
 required: ?CC[ ?T ]
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
{code}

(type variables should not occur in error messages)
