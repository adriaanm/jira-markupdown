It doesn't seem possible to use {{(=> A) => B}} in contexts requiring {{A => B}}:

{code}
scala> def log(a: => Any): Unit = println(a)
log: (a: => Any)Unit

scala> def apply[A, B](a: A)(f: A => B) = f(a)
apply: [A, B](a: A)(f: A => B)B

scala> apply("hello")(log)
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (=> Any) => Unit
 required: Int => ?
              apply("hello")(log)
                             ^
{code}

If you try to go the other direction, using {{A => B}} in contexts requiring {{(=> A) => B}}, the result depends on how you're trying to do it:

{code}
scala> def log(a: Any) = println(a)
log: (a: Any)Unit

scala> def apply[A, B](a: A)(f: (=> A) => B) = f(a)
apply: [A, B](a: A)(f: (=> A) => B)B

scala> apply("hello")(log)
<function0>

scala> apply("hello")(identity)
java.lang.ClassCastException: $anonfun$apply$1 cannot be cast to java.lang.String
{code}
=> is underspecified so I'm guessing, but to use (=> A) => B where A => B is expected would imply either that A <:< (=> A), which can't be the case, or that there is something which automatically converts values of type (=> A) => B to values of type A => B, which there isn't unless you make one.

But you can make one.

{code}
scala> implicit def upgradeByName[A, B](x: (=> A) => B): A => B = (p: A) => x(p)
upgradeByName: [A, B](x: (=> A) => B)A => B

scala> apply("hello")(log)
hello
{code}

The other way is buggy as is clear from the CCE.
Yeah... I'd assumed that the value type {{A}} and parameterless method type {{=> A}} were compatible or equivalent. The only thing in the spec that vaguely justifies that assumption is:

6.26.2: A parameterless method {{m}} of type {{=> T}} is always converted to type {{T}} by evaluating the expression to which {{m}} is bound.

This is talking about the semantics of expression evaluation, though, not the typing rules...
