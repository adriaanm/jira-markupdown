On a completely unrelated note, I think that `StringContext.s` will need to be converted into a macro, too, if we want to have a chance of replacing usages of `any2StringAdd` with string interpolation, due to performance and inlining/constant behavior.

Also, we should probably add `StringContext.r`, using som-snytt's amazing regextractor (https://github.com/som-snytt/regextractor) and get rid of `StringLike.r`.

Mhh, this has become more off-topic than expected ... I should bring this up on the mailing list ...
