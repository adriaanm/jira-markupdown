I saw this blog post...

http://www.advogato.org/person/connolly/diary/71.html

The specific example was

[error] /home/connolly/projects/rdfsem/src/test/scala/rdfstdtest.scala:137:
not found: value Graph
[error]     val manifest = Graph(WebData.loadRDFXML(args(0)))
[error]                    ^

I wonder how hard it'd be for the compiler to check for a class of type Graph is in scope, then report to the user that since somePackage.Graph is not a case class that the "new Graph" expression needs to be used?
Ah yes, I read the same article (but couldn't remember later) and reported that as #2999, as well.
I addressed this in r24308.  I didn't use the word "new" in the message, maybe I should.  The hint is pretty strong though.
```scala
      scala> scala.collection.mutable.MultiMap(1, 2, 3)
      <console>:8: error: object MultiMap is not a member of package scala.collection.mutable
      Note: trait MultiMap exists, but it has no companion object.
```
