Some bug fixes (for instance, #5975) depend on having tree attachements and cannot be backported to 2.9.x.

It would help to have the infrastructure, so this and other tickets will be easily backported.
This will also make it easier to rid the world of the `Apply` subclasses, in a 2.9.x-IDE-friendly way.

It would be still very useful, because we'd like to release a major IDE upgrade around the time 2.10.0 is out. That will be the last IDE release for 2.9. This backport enables fixing many spurious errors regarding default arguments, so even though it might not be useful for 2.10, it's still very important.

It does not need to be done by M6, or part of the 2.10 release cycle, but before 2.10 is out would be a major plus for IDE users.
