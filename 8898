Here is another one; it's a bit subtle that this is a bug because it does issue a deprecation warning. The problem is that it's the deprecation warning for scala.annotation.cloneable, not scala.cloneable. So again the type is being replaced too early.
```
scala> @scala.cloneable class Foo()
<console>:7: warning: class cloneable in package annotation is deprecated: instead of `@cloneable class C`, use `class C extends Cloneable`
       @scala.cloneable class Foo()
                              ^
defined class Foo
```
