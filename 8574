I hadn't realized how easy it is to hit this:
{code}
scala> case class Foo(clazz: Class[_])
<console>:7: warning: inferred existential type Option[Class[_$1]] forSome { type _$1 }, which cannot be expressed by wildcards,  should be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.existentials visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.existentials'
or by setting the compiler option -language:existentials.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.existentials for a discussion
why the feature should be explicitly enabled.
       case class Foo(clazz: Class[_])
                  ^
defined class Foo
{code}
