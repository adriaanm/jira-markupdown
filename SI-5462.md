On Oracle JDK:

{code}

scala> object State extends Enumeration {
     |   val IDLE, STARTED = Value
     |   var x = IDLE
     | }
defined module State

scala> State.x
res0: State.Value = IDLE

scala> State.IDLE
res1: State.Value = IDLE 
{code}

On OpenJDK, it prints "x" instead of "IDLE" because the name of the var is accidentally picked up instead of the intended field name. This is implementation-dependent: "The elements in the array returned are not sorted and are not in any particular order" ([http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getMethods()]).

There's probably not much we can do about this unless we can use Scala reflection instead of Java reflection to get the fields in the correct order.
