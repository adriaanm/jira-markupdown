Hi, I'm pretty happy that the issue has been reopened, I'm wondering if the language specs regarding implicit resolution has been reinterpreted. Initially the reproduction
case was judged to be coherent with the language spec, so Hubert, when you say you have
a fix, do you interpret the language specs differently ?
