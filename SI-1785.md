I cannot call generic apply call for new instances. But according to spec it must run well:
```scala
class A {
  def apply[T](x: Int) = 1
}

(new A)[Int](1)
```
Presumably he thinks "(new A)[Int](1)" ought to say "res0: 1" instead of "<console>:1: error: ';' expected but '[' found."

I agree in principle, and trunk already has several fixes allowing for apply methods to be called more flexibly, for instance this doesn't work in 2.7.3:
```scala
scala> def foo(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
foo: (Int,Int)Int

scala> (foo _)(5, 10)
res0: Int = 15
```
However this would represent a rather more significant change to the parser and I'm not really convinced it's a good idea given that it works if you let the type argument be inferred or if you call apply explicitly.
```scala
scala> (new A)(1)
res0: Int = 1

scala> (new A).apply[Int](1)
res1: Int = 1
```
So I recategorized to enhancement.
