There isn't much we can do.  See scala/bug#4214 among many others in the 4000s.  Putting java.lang.Long there is a lie (there is no method which returns java.lang.Long) and it breaks things.  Primitive types can't appear in the signature: that breaks things even worse.  There is no choice left but Object.

You can (and will have to) get the information out of the scala signature.  Clearly our motivation to make this easy with a scala reflection library has gone way up recently, but it's not imminent.  There is code out there somewhere to dredge the info out, and/or you can look at scalap.
