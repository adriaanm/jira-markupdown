When the Scala Eclipse plugin is installed, EclEmma  ( http://www.eclemma.org/ ) fails to display text highlighting, vertical ruler annotations, and overview annotations in the Java Editor Area. 

(EclEmma's Label decorations in Package and Outline view work well, as does the Coverage view. Only the Java Editor Area is affected.)

When I uninstall the 2.7.3 plugin and restart Eclipse (and re-run a Coverage run), I can see EclEmma's Java Editor annotations. When I reinstall the 2.7.3 plugin (and re-run a Coverage run), I cannot see EclEmma's Java Editor annotations.

I see this problem in the Java Perspective, where I'd expect the Scala plugin would not be touching anything.

I have no idea why these two plugins interfere.

I'm seeing this behavior on Mac and Linux Eclipse 3.4 Ganymede.


I can test the latest build sometime later this week.

I have not used Scala SVN repo before. Can you give me a direct link to the location to download the plugin build?

Thanks!
Thanks!

I'd recommend simply installing from the nightly build update site as described in "Trunk version => Installation Issues" here,

The new plugin (2.8.0 nightly) is not working at all for me.
I'm getting so many strange errors that I think I need to re-install Eclipse before proceeding further.

I notice that the nightly plugin is based on the new AspectJ-style plugin, so I guess I need a clean start.

Also, if the nightly plugin is using Scala-2.8.0, Im going to have problems. My project is mixed Eclipse + command-line Ant, and the Ant side is running off of stable Scala 2.7.3. I need to run builds in both command-line scalac-2.7.3 and in Eclipse.  I imagine that's not going to be compatible with a Scala-2.8.0 eclipse plugin.

If someone else can verify this bug and fix (or maybe I can try again on machine with a clean Eclipse/Scala-2.8.0 setup), that would help. Then the answer for users will be to work with only 2.8.0+ language/tools.
I installed 2.8.0.r17137-b200902180022844 on another machine with Eclipse and EclEmma,
and now I am seeing EclEmma's highlights in Java editor view.

So that's good.

I tried to uninstall 2.8.0 and re-install 2.7.3, to re-verify the bug and fix on this machine, but now Eclipse is dieing on Startup.

I suspect the general Eclipse problems are not Scala-specific, just general instability around Eclipse and plugin management.

So, 2.8.0 nightly seems to resolve the EclEmma problem. If anyone else can verify the fix and not see other Eclipse problems, consider this bug fixed.

Thanks, Miles!

I have successfully completed this test:

Uninstall Scala
Run EclEmma tests -> highlights work
Install Scala 2.7.3 
Run EclEmma tests -> highlights do not work
Uninstall Scala 2.7.3 
Install Scala 2.8.0
Run EclEmma tests -> highlights do work

I consider this fixed!
