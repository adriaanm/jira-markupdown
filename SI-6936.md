Type projections used in type members are rendered wrong in scaladoc. For instance

```scala
trait Sys[S <:Sys[S]] {
  type Tx
  type Var[A] <: stm.Var[S#Tx, A]
  ...
}
```

In Scala 2.9.2, the projection was simply 'lost', so the doc showed `Var[A] <: Var[Tx, A]`. Scala 2.10 improved the situation, but strangely displays the projection with a period instead of a hash symbol, as if it was a dependent type: `Var[A] <: stm.Var[S.Tx, A]`.
