Someone wanted to import packages on the command line. I said put it in a -i file.  Hey, he didn't give me the green check!  Anyway, I noticed this throws `CNF: Main`:

{code}
scala -e "import util._"
{code}

when it would actually be friendlier to handle the imports and drop into interactive mode.

It might be nice to have a way to do arbitrary -e exprs and drop into interactive mode.  I guess we can't use -i for interactive.
