It appears that way back in r17288 (march 2009) I introduced a bug in Settings, and here I am reporting on my own crimes.

{code}
// choice setting  
% scala27 -Ylinearizer:normal
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.7.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).

// correct behavior: the error message is poor because it's the same one given
// on totally unrecognized options, but at least it's an error
% scala27 -Ylinearizer
bad option: '-Ylinearizer'

// but since r17288
% scala28 -Ylinearizer
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
{code}
It's just assigning the default to the setting, so it's not like it's pulling any rabbits out of hats.
(In r24533) [I'm laptop only so there's some chance this will incur temporary
breakage, but it needs committing.]

Heading off gratuitous complications which haven't yet shipped, I
eliminated the -jar startup option in favor of doing what we already do,
figuring it out.  So now all these things work.

  scala foo/bar.scala // if file is a script or has one main method
  scala foo.Bar       // if it has a legal main method
  scala foo.jar       // if it has a legal MainClass attribute

Also changed "-savecompiled" to "-save" and given scala source
called foo.scala, generate foo.jar rather than foo.scala.jar.
Cleaned up a bunch of related code and further polished the
scala startup message.  And unbroke choice settings and improved
that error too, which closes SI-3849.

While trying to write a test for the choice setting, was reminded
that partest just discards invalid flags files.  Made it fail instead,
which closes SI-3712.  Fixed the new failures that revealed.  No review.
