Attempting to use the Guava cache package without the JSR-305 and JSR-330 annotations in the classpath results in some rather strange error messages:

```

At a minimum, the compiler should explain that compilation against Java class files with missing annotations is not allowed, and not emit all of those other strange messages.

It would be preferable, however, for the compiler to proceed without the missing annotations, like the Java compiler does.

It seems that [others have run into this problem as well](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13856266/class-broken-error-with-joda-time-using-scala), but I couldn't find any mention of it in the issue tracker.
Perhaps related to #7551
I've cobbled together a test case, which has indeed progressed in 2.11.

I've just encountered same issue with Spring 4.0.1.RELEASE, Spring-Scala 1.0.0.RC1, Scala 2.10.3, sbt 0.13.1 and JDK 1.7 update 45. Spring 4.0.x is using a JDK 8 annotation `java.lang.annotation.Repetable` (see [here](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-11086)). Compilation with Scala, of class which makes use of Spring annotation annotated with `@Repeatable`, fails:
```
...
[info] Compiling 15 Scala sources to C:\foo\bar\target\scala-2.10\classes...
[error] Class java.lang.annotation.Repeatable not found - continuing with a stub.
[error] Caught: java.lang.NullPointerException while parsing annotations in C:\Users\stevo.slavic\.ivy2\cache\org.springframework\spring-context\jars\spring-context-4.0.1.RELEASE.jar(org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.class)
[error] two errors found
[error] (compile:compile) Compilation failed
```
FWIW I am also seeing apparently the same problem in the following situation, and I have a work-around for the situation, which might help others or highlight a possible improvement to the scala compiler:

- Project depends on hadoop-client
- hadoop-common depends on commons-logging
- We exclude commons-logging dependency from hadoop-client and instead replace it with SLF4J's shim jcl-over-slf4j, a drop-in API replacement

We get:

```scala
[WARNING] Class org.apache.commons.logging.Log not found - continuing with a stub.
[ERROR] error while loading FileInputFormat, class file '/Users/srowen/.m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/hadoop-core/1.0.4/hadoop-core-1.0.4.jar(org/apache/hadoop/mapred/FileInputFormat.class)' is broken
```

The class is available in jcl-over-slf4j, but is marked as "runtime" dependency since it is not used directly, and not needed -- by the likes of javac at least -- at compile time.

Changing the scope to "compile" makes it work, presumably because then scalac sees it, and it seems that without seeing it, this error occurs. I don't know if it's realistic, but ideally the behavior would match that of javac, which does not need knowledge of a dependency like this.
I found the change I was thinking of. It is #7439, which is fixed in 2.10.4.

Our "stub symbol" handling regressed badly before that fix. We still run into problems with it, but I would be interested to hear how your scenario is handled in 2.10.4-RC2.
It has occur in 2.10.3, 2.10.4, 2.11.0  in compile time.

I use spring 4 @Scheduled that use @Repeatable in JDK 8
I also fixed #8442 in the upcoming 2.11.1 / 2,10.5 which manifests in the same way.
~~Ran into this with Scala 2.11.8. Regression?~~ [-A workaround- Compiler warnings are solved by including Google's JSR-305 library|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8978?focusedCommentId=71168&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-71168] (as described in #8978) ~~fixes this~~ which may be helpful to projects with `"-Xfatal-warnings"`.
@retronym, I looked before I leapt. It's while I was making a sample project I noticed my error came from `"-Xfatal-warnings"`. So… non-issue. Sorry for the noise!
