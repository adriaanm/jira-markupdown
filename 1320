After some discussion the conclusion is that the specced behaviour for this is broken.

The suggested fix is that stable identifier patterns defined behaviour will be modified so that something matches it if and only if it is equal to that stable identifier *and* is an instance of the static type of that identifier. Thus in this case L() will not match the pattern N because it is not an instance of N.type.
