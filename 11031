```
But your translation is equivalent to requiring that Node has a member of type A
```

Yes, very true. In fact, that's how I  would intuitively read this GADT definition in the presence of `sealed` -- A `Node[A]` must be an `L[C,D]` for some `(C => D) =:= A`, and an `L[C,D]` has a member of type `C => D` aka `A`.

To me, it is more surprising that that intuitive reading turns out not to hold.
