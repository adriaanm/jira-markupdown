See [http://www.nabble.com/Newbie-question-about-existentials-td15083731.html#a15083731 this thread] for details.

Consider the following:
```scala
class Type[T]
val TInt = new Type[int]()

type Ret = (Type[T], T => String) forSome { type T; }

val r1 : Ret = (TInt, {(x : int) => x.toString()})

// the following both fail, why?
// val r: Ret = if (true) r1 else r1
// val r: Ret = if (true) r1: Ret else r1: Ret

// the following works, why?
val r: Ret = if (true) r1: Ret with Ret else r1: Ret with Ret 
```

What is the type "Ret with Ret" necessary, and what does it even mean? Here is my original guess:

  ...I don't see why it should work either. The type "Ret with Ret" seems patently absurd to me. Unless it's needed to trick the compiler into instantiating Ret twice with different skolemizations?? Seems bizarre...

This seems very strange. If it's not a bug, I would love to know the real explanation.
I believe this is as it should be. Ret is an existential type. r1 has this existential type. Using r1 twice will give two different instantiations on T. I slightly changed the type disgnostic to make this clearer:
```scala
t0519.scala:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Test.Type[_1] forSome { type _1 >: T with T }, (T with T) => String) where type T, (some other)type T
 required: Test.Ret
val r2: Ret = if (true) r1 else r1
              ^
one error found
```
Aside: This is exactly the reason why dependent types are ``better_ than existential ones: Equalities don't get lost just by opening up a type of a value twice.
