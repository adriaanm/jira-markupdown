when i do this in the REPL
```scala
import annotation.static
@static var x = 42
```
I get a stacktrace and at the end
```
That entry seems to have slain the compiler.  Shall I replay
your session? I can re-run each line except the last one.
[y/n]
```

btw
```
import annotation.static
@static val x = 42
```
does that too

but

```
import annotation.static
@static def x = 42
```

not

This works in the REPL
```
import annotation.static
object Test {
  @static
  var x = 42
}
```

This crashes the REPL and compiler:
```scala
import annotation.static
class Test {
  @static
  def x = 42
}
```
