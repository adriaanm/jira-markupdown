Given the following test code:
{code}
trait a {
  object foo {
    def bar = List(1,2).map(_*2)
  }
}

trait b {
  object foo {
    def bar = List(1,2).map(_*2)
  }
  class foo { }
}
{code}

...the generated bytecode for a$$foo$$ contains references to the non-existent a$$foo, as does the anon function generated for the map.  In the case of b (which defines a class of the same name as the object) the references incorrectly point to the class instead of the object.  This can be seen by way of reflection:

{code}
scala> Class.forName("a$$foo$$").getDeclaredClasses
res0: Array[java.lang.Class[_]] = Array()
scala> Class.forName("a$$foo").getDeclaredClasses
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: a$$foo

scala> Class.forName("b$$foo$$").getDeclaredClasses
res1: Array[java.lang.Class[_]] = Array()
scala> Class.forName("b$$foo").getDeclaredClasses 
res2: Array[java.lang.Class[_]] = Array(class b$$foo$$$$anonfun$$bar$$2)
{code}

I came across this attempting to use proguard on the scala jars. It objects to processing them because of inconsistent InnerClasses attributes due to the above issue - for instance there are references to the non-existent class scala/tools/nsc/symtab/Definitions$$definitions .
Sorry, I should better have demonstrated the other direction.
{code}
scala> Class.forName("a$$foo$$$$anonfun$$bar$$1").getDeclaringClass
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: a$$foo
	at java.lang.Class.getDeclaringClass(Native Method)
scala> Class.forName("b$$foo$$$$anonfun$$bar$$2").getDeclaringClass
res2: java.lang.Class[_] = class b$$foo
{code}
Here is some more information on this issue, to add to the information already provided:

I see two problems here in the generated class-files:
 * Incorrect !InnerClasses attributes
 * Incorrect Method Signature attributes involving Scala.Nothing and Scala.Null

More details below:

== Problem 1 - Incorrect !InnerClasses attributes ==
This code demonstrates the problem:

{code}
object OneLevelOuter {
    def bar = List(1,2).map(_*2)
}

object TwoLevelOuter {
  object Outer {
    def bar = List(1,2).map(_*2)
  }
}  
{code}

Here, !OneLevelOuter$$.class has an !InnerClasses attribute with the following information:[[BR]]
inner_class_info: !OneLevelOuter$$$$anonfun$$bar$$1[[BR]]
outer_class_info: !OneLevelOuter. This looks incorrect. It should be: !OneLevelOuter$$. In this case, !OneLevelOuter actually does exist, so outer_class_info points to the wrong class.

!TwoLevelOuter$$Outer$$.class has an !InnerClasses attribute with the following information:[[BR]]
inner_class_info: !TwoLevelOuter$$Outer$$$$anonfun$$bar$$2[[BR]]
outer_class_info: !TwoLevelOuter$$Outer. This looks incorrect. It should be: !TwoLevelOuter$$Outer$$. In this case, !TwoLevelOuter$$Outer does not exist, so outer_class_info points to a non-existant class.

== Problem 2 - Incorrect Method Signature attributes involving Scala.Nothing and Scala.Null ==

This code demonstrates the problem:

{code}
object MethodSig {
  val Empty = new collection.immutable.Stack[Nothing]
  def m1: Nothing = {
    throw new RuntimeException()
  }
}
{code}

This translates to the following in the classfile for !MethodSig$$:

A method called Empty with:[[BR]]
Descriptor: ()Lscala/collection/immutable/Stack;[[BR]]
Signature: ()Lscala/collection/immutable/Stack<Lscala/Nothing;>;[[BR]]

A method called m1 with:[[BR]]
Descriptor: ()Lscala/runtime/Nothing$$;[[BR]]
Signature: none, because this is not a generic method.

As you can see, Nothing is referenced correctly in the Descriptor for m1, but not in the Signature for Empty.

I vaguely remember having tried to set the outer class to be the current class, so `Outer` for the mirror class, and `Outer$$` for the module class, and getting runtime exceptions on the JVM. I don't think the spec talks about the same thing. I understand it as the outer name might not exist as a class on the class path. What I was hinting at, is having two different, loaded and linked classes, `Outer` and `Outer$$`, which have different outer entries for the same inner class. Maybe it was this bug: SI-1167.

I think this is quite easy to hack, but I am a bit short on time until next week. If someone here is ready to do it, I can point out relevant pieces of code. 

> With respect to this issue, I would say anytime "using scala from java" comes into conflict with other reasonable goals, "using scala from java" should lose out, especially if it's just "using scala from java with pretty names." (I do think "using java from scala" should be a high priority.)

Agreed. So you would make inner classes member of the module class, and live with '$$' names in Java? That was the way it worked some time ago, then it was 'fixed' to support nicer names for inner classes. I don't remember all the arguments, but we should check at least SI-1126 before doing the change.
Replying to [comment:13 dragos]:
> I change the way InnerClasses are reported for inner objects, but kept the old scheme for top level objects. That should not be a problem: in the case when there's a companion class, the reference is correct. If there's no companion, that the compiler generates a mirror class, and again the reference is 'bound'. I think this way we get the best of both worlds.

While I've been using ProGuard 4.5Beta3 with no problems with Scala 2.8Beta1, switching to recent nightly builds of Scala 2.8 (re)introduces the problems of bytecode references to non-existant classes.

It is not limited to the Scala library, but shows up for user classes:

[proguard] Warning: com.test.app.abc.data.QueryDtl$$: can't find referenced class com.test.app.abc.data.QueryDtl$$$$anonfun$$apply$$1
