To be able to create use site and declaration site compiler warnings. Currently only the former can be hacked by using a deprecation warning, but this is inelegant.

The purpose is to flag up temporary code in development that needs to be replaced. So it is not forgotten and can be found quickly.
This is possible with macros, which can issue arbitrary warnings.

{code}
scala> import language.experimental.macros
import language.experimental.macros

scala> import reflect.macros.Context
import reflect.macros.Context

scala> def warnImpl(c: Context)(msg: c.Expr[String]): c.Expr[Unit] = {
     |   import c.universe._
     |   val Literal(Constant(msgString: String)) = msg.tree
     |   c.warning(c.macroApplication.pos, msgString)
     |   c.literalUnit
     | }
warning: there were 2 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
warnImpl: (c: reflect.macros.Context)(msg: c.Expr[String])c.Expr[Unit]

scala> def warn(msg: String): Unit = macro warnImpl
defined term macro warn: (msg: String)Unit

scala> warn("Achtung!")
<console>:12: warning: Achtung!
              warn("Achtung!")
                  ^
{code}

Given that this is possible, I'm closing this ticket as "out of scope". Please comment if there is a use case this doesn't cover.
