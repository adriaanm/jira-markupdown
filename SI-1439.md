If you compile this with -unchecked you get:
{code}
/home/odersky/scala/test/files/new/hkpatterns.scala:5: warning: non variable type-argument _[A] in type pattern is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
    case v: View[_] =>
            ^
one warning found
{code}
fixed as duplicate of SI-2517 (but that ticket needs an improvement, see SI-2606)
Both SI-2517 and SI-2606 are closed but the original problem still persists with 2.8.1 and 2.9.0.r24458-b20110315020117:

(extempore in [r25075|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25075]) Don't issue unchecked warnings on higher-kinded types.
Closes #1439, review by moors.
