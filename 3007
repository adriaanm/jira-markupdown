This bug is very annoing, so I watch the thread and hope for fix.
I used annotations for AOP(aspectj) in one of my scala projects for android. 
Here is workaround that working for me. Maybe, it will help you.

- declare annotation Cacheable in Java
https://github.com/ezh/android-DigiLib/blob/master/src/main/java/org/digimead/digi/ctrl/lib/aop/Cacheable.java

There is no URL because this part of code is not public.

- use annotation Cacheable in Scala
@Cacheable(namespace = Cache.web, examination = true)
protected def httpGetFunc[T](force: Boolean, url: String)(implicit m: scala.reflect.Manifest[T]): Option[T] = try {

Cache.web as simple as

object Cache {
  // pregenerated random
  final val web = 123456
  final val marketItem = 654321
  object Period {
    final val ever = -1
    final val default = 0
  }
}

King Regards
