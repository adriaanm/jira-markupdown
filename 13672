I was verifying the fix for ticket scala/bug#1186 and it seems to solve the PartialFunction problem. Unfortunately, a small modification to the test file causes javac to fail again.
```scala

javac -cp /home/ijuma/src/scala/dists/scala-2.7.1.r15813-b20080817230306/lib/scala-library.jar:. Test.java 
Test.java:5: Internal error: stack sim error on 
void foo() {
    new HashMap();
}
  void foo() {
```

As can be seen, the library was compiled from svn revision 15813.

Test.java:
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable.HashMap;

public class Test {

  void foo() {
    new HashMap<String, String>();
  }
}
```
