ActorGC allows the scheduler to be implicitly shutdown when all the actors associated with it have either exited or become unreachable.  While this is very convenient for many applications, the added complexity and inherent non-determinism caused by relying on the garbage collector in some cases make it more trouble than it is worth.  Also, many applications have well defined lifetimes, so explicitly shutting down the scheduler isn't a big deal.

Actors directly interact with ActorGC in three ways:
1. Notifying ActorGC that they have started
2. Notifying ActorGC that they have exited
3. Registering a function to be run on termination

These all can be moved into IScheduler as follows:
{code}
  def registerActor(actor: Actor): Unit
  def unregisterActor(actor: Actor): Unit
  def addUnregisterHook(actor: Actor)(f: => Unit): Unit
}}
and in cases when ActorGC is used, the scheduler can basically forward the calls onto it.  In other cases, they can be no-ops or perform other tasks.

The behavior for using ActorGC can also be extracted into a mixin so that it can be easily added to any scheduler implementation:
{code}
trait SchedulerGCSupport extends IScheduler {
  protected val actorGC = new ActorGC
  def registerActor(actor: Actor): Unit = actorGC.newActor(actor)
  def unregisterActor(actor: Actor): Unit = actorGC.terminated(actor)
  def addUnregisterHook(actor: Actor)(f: => Unit): Unit = actorGC.onTerminate(actor)(f)
}
{code}

I implemented this in r17806 (trunk) with some changes, though. The most important ones are:

  * I used the existing method names `newActor`, `terminated` and `onTerminate`, instead of
    adding the ones you proposed; they have the exact same meaning anyway.

  * I turned `ActorGC` into a trait, replacing `SchedulerGCSupport`.

  * I moved the logic to configure the thread pool using the `actors.corePoolSize` and
    `actors.maxPoolSize` Java properties into the separate `ThreadPoolConfig` object.
    Therefore, using the configuration won't result in initialising the `Scheduler` object.
