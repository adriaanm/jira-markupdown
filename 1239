As a final followup to this ticket, I should clarify that we only encountered the issue as submitted by the original poster; no actual files were ever removed during our tests.

The issue apparently stems from a "feature" of the IzPack installer package. In short, rather than keeping track of the files and directories that were created during the installation, the uninstaller just removes all of the installed files first, and then perform a cleanup phase by removing the empty directories that are left around.

If the installation directory chosen for the installation is not empty, however, then some unrelated empty subdirectories of the same directory may be erroneously purged when the uninstaller is used, due to the aforementioned behavior. This issue may only arise on *nix or OS X machines on which the jar installer was used for the installation; Windows systems are not affected. A workaround and various improvements were added to the IzPack installer in Scala 2.7.7.RC2 and later.
