That's good.


>  * I of course wrote a few tests to reproduce the problem and verify that it was corrected after the change. I sadly found no description/hint on how to write unit-tests that can be integrated in the Scala build. I actually found an entry in the scala-incubator google-group that lead me to think that no unit-test framework has yet been defined/chosen for unit testing in Scala. Therefore I do not offer any unit tests for the change - which doesn't make me happy...

Have a look at the tests in test/files directory. Usually you would be interested in pos/neg/run (meaning files that should compile, shouldn't and should be run, respectively).
It would be indeed crucial to have tests for that.

Every contribution is appreciated. Usually reassigning the bug to scala_reviewer will do the job and someone will pick the patch from there.
