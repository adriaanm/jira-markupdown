The compiler crashes, when using lazy values inside assignment expressions of class, object or trait member variables. The following code crashes the compilers: 2.7.2.-final and 2.8.9.-r16886.

{code}
object Red {
  var foo = {
    lazy val bar = None
    bar
  }
}
{code}

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: symbol variable bitmap$$0 does not exist in Red.bar$$1
{code}
