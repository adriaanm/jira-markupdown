Actually, this looks like a progression, it is now consistent with a non-overloaded method in a package object and an example with nesting:
```scala
// Fails uniformly on 2.10 and 2.11
object Enc {
  def sqrt(x: Double): Double = Math.sqrt(x)
  def sqrt(x: String): Double = Math.sqrt(0)
  object FastComplex {
    import java.lang.Math.sqrt

    sqrt(0d)
  }
}
```
