Hardlinks are not an option either:
2009-10-17 00:53:28.752  :bash: karolrvn@karolrvn-laptop : ~/adfadf/programming/eclipse/workspace $$ ln /home/karolrvn/adfadf/programming/verknowsys/codadris/ide_projects/* .
ln: `/home/karolrvn/adfadf/programming/verknowsys/codadris/ide_projects/codadris.binblocklang': hard link not allowed for directory
...
So it seems like I have to wait for Scala Eclipse Plugin 2.8.0 stable version...
When is it expected to be released (can be a dumb question in IT, i realize) ?
It will force scala-lib 2.8.0 which will make it necessary to change scala version in all our modules, right?
