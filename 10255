"Open question whether that inefficiency has any benefit; it doesn't try to nuance anything."

Having tried, I'll tell you it's harder than it looks to incrementally improve on the current approach, because it's tricky to be sure you can omit an import entirely. Wildcard imports with lower scope, implicits, renames, and then there is the little feature where a name might be shadowed in only one namespace, like this:
```scala
object Foo {
  class Bar
  object Bar
}
object Quux {
  class Bar
}

object Test {
  import Foo.Bar

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    import Quux.Bar
    new Bar
    Bar
  }
}
```
