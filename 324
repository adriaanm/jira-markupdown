Ah! I see, dropWhile/takeWhile are implemented using drop/take and are type inferenced, so we probably forgot to update the types. I should go in and annotate the types in BoxedArray.scala, then make sure they correspond to the annotated types in Array.scala, to prevent these kinds of problems from arriving. Then things should work.
