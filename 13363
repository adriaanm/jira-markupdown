Current scala compiler has some magic, so field

{code}
var table: Array[Entry]
{code}

of trait !HashTable is compiled to !BoxedAnyArray, because Entry is a generic type. For performance reason "table" field should be plain array. Patch attached.

I'm trying to speed up Scala compiler. After applying patch compilation of simple

{code}
class A
{code}

sped up for about 1% (Sun JDK 1.6).
