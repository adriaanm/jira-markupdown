Current scala compiler has some magic, so field
```scala
var table: Array[Entry]
```

of trait !HashTable is compiled to !BoxedAnyArray, because Entry is a generic type. For performance reason "table" field should be plain array. Patch attached.

I'm trying to speed up Scala compiler. After applying patch compilation of simple
```scala
class A
```

sped up for about 1% (Sun JDK 1.6).
