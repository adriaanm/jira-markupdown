When an abstract type is bound by several super types then the order of the super types influences the information that is used for the abstract type. It seems that only the first super type does count.

In the following example the abstract types Element and Document behave differently if the super type "Node" is given first or is given last.

```scala
  trait Nodes {

    trait INode
    trait IElement extends INode
    trait IDocument extends INode

    type Node <: INode
//    type Element <: IElement with Node
//    type Document <: IDocument with Node
    type Element <: Node with IElement
    type Document <: Node with IDocument

  }
```

If "Node" is given first then in the following match expression the first case matches instance of type Document:

```scala
  def apply(node: Node): Unit = node match {
    case n: Element => println("element")
    case n: Document => println("document")
  }
```

If "Node" is given last when defining the abstract types then the match expressions works as expected.

The attached test program output "element element" or "element document" depending on whether "Node" is given first or last.

I think the situation could be improved by using the most specific type that is available as an upper bound for an abstract type.
actually, erasure has already been refined with a similar use case in mind, except it's different from yours

since `Node` is an abstract type, the traits are not considered more specific (since `Node` could be ANY subtype of `INode`)

this set of bounds

```scala
type Element <: INode with IElement
type Document <: INode with IDocument
```

yields the same output as these:

```scala
type Element <: IElement with INode
type Document <: IDocument with INode
```

I would argue the current behaviour is the correct one, but I'll leave the ticket open because it's the weekend
In my example I had

```scala
type Element <: Node with IElement
type Document <: Node with IDocument
```

which seems to get interpreted as

```scala
type Element <: INode
type Document <: INode
```

i.e. the second parts of the bound ("IElement" and "IDocument") seem not to be considered.

I am not sure if this behaviour can be called correct.

Note that there is an unchecked warning on each of those typed patterns, so it shouldn't be too surprising that it might not work as expected.

I think it is more the implementation of `isInstanceOf` and not necessarily erasure in general that is in question.  For example, `isInstanceof[A with B]` works as expected for class types `A` and `B`, so `isInstanceOf` is already a bit more specific than erasure.

I made a patch as a proof of concept that makes `isInstanceOf[T]` check the upper bound of T if it is an abstract type:

  http://github.com/harrah/scala-starrless/commit/236b4bf4c56

With the patch, the original example prints the same thing in both examples.

In any case, I think this is a duplicate of #329.
