I've tried: 
{code}
<scalac srcdir="src" destdir="${build}" classpathref="netlogo.classpath" force="changed" addparams="-g" deprecation="on" encoding="us-ascii" target="jvm-1.5"> 
  <include name="**/*.scala"/> 
  <include name="**/*.java"/> 
</scalac> 
{code}
but when I run "ant -v" I see a bunch of lines like: 
{code}
  org/nlogo/agent/Agent.java skipped - don't know how to handle it 
  org/nlogo/agent/Agent3D.java skipped - don't know how to handle it 
  org/nlogo/agent/AgentSet.java skipped - don't know how to handle it 
{code}

and so on... the Java files get skipped (and I get a compile error whenever Scala code refers to Java code). I looked at the source code for the task and saw code that explicitly rejects any filename that doesn't end in .scala.

(fwiw, I don't need a fix for this myself since I have now ditched Ant â€” but it seems like missing basic functionality for one of 2.7.2's new features)
