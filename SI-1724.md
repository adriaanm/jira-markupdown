Outline does not select the definition at cursor position when "link with editor" is enabled. Only when switching to a different source file, the oultine switches to the first (?) class of that file.

The same is true for the breadcrumbs.

Another problem is that I can't disable the breadcrumbs anymore. Shift-Alt-B doesn't work (on Mac at least), and the symbol to toggle Breadcrumbs is disabled. which I got by right-clicking the source file and selecting "Show in Breadcrumb".

I'm working on the compiler sources, using eclipse plugin 2.8.0-20090210.
The toggle breadcrumb icon works as expected with the current trunk build. It's quite possible that that's a change since the 10/2/2009 you're using so please could you try it again with something more recent.

Nb. if you can't see the toggle breadcrumb icon on the toolbar it's,

  Window => Customize Perspective => Commands

and select Jave Element Presentation.
Right, toggling breadcrumbs now works, thanks.

Yep, it took me some time to find that :)
