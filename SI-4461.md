=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
    import scala.collection.mutable._
    import scala.collection.script._

    val buf = new ArrayBuffer[Int] with ObservableBuffer[Int]
    buf.subscribe(new Subscriber[Message[Int], ObservableBuffer[Int]] {
      def notify(pub: ObservableBuffer[Int], event: Message[Int]) = println(event)
    })
    
    buf += 1 // works
    buf ++= Array(2) // works
    buf ++= ArrayBuffer(3) // fails
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
I expect to see three messages printed to the console:
{code}
Include(End,1)
Include(End,2)
Include(End,3)
{code}


=== What do you see instead? ===
Only the first two messages are printed:
{code}
Include(End,1)
Include(End,2)
{code}


=== Additional information ===
Comes from the overloaded ++= in ArrayBuffer, which handles IndexedSeqs differently. Maybe other overloaded methods prevent the ObservableXXX decorators from notifying property in other circumstances, too.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_24-b07-334-10M3326
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.7
Background info:


The overrides in {{ObservableBuffer}} currently do not include {{++=}}. They currently are: 

{code}
  abstract override def +=(element: A): this.type

  abstract override def +=:(element: A): this.type

  abstract override def update(n: Int, newelement: A): Unit

  abstract override def remove(n: Int): A

  abstract override def clear(): Unit
{code}

(some of these overrides are for {{BufferLike}}, others for {{Growable}}, and others for {{SeqLike}}). 

In the example, the following callsite is not "observed" 

{code}
 buf ++= ArrayBuffer(3) // fails
{code}

because the override in {{ArrayBuffer}} that gets picked is: 

{code}
  /** Appends a number of elements provided by a traversable object.
   *  The identity of the buffer is returned.
   *
   *  @param xs    the traversable object.
   *  @return      the updated buffer.
   */
  override def ++=(xs: TraversableOnce[A]): this.type = xs match {
    case v: IndexedSeq[_] =>
      val n = v.length
      ensureSize(size0 + n)
      v.copyToArray(array.asInstanceOf[scala.Array[Any]], size0, n)
      size0 += n
      this
    case _ =>
      super.++=(xs)
  }

{code}

It would be great if a patch were provided (and tests run!). Additionally, are there any other mutator methods that don't get "observed"?



(In r24885) Fixes and closes SI-4461. No review.
According to {{BufferLike}} ScalaDocs, also {{insertAll}} needs to be overridden, but it's not in [trunk|https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk//src//library/scala/collection/mutable/ObservableBuffer.scala]. Not only that method is affected - it's called also by {{++=:}} and {{insert}}. I've attached a runnable testcase+fix (IssueSI4461.scala). It compares the behavior trunk ObservableBuffer with another trait which also overrides insertAll correctly, confirming that the bug occurs - look at the console output and notice the difference between notifications of the two buffers. The implementation of insertAll could be added to ObservableBuffer directly.

Moreover, your implementation disables any optimized implementation. Would you consider a different fix? I'm giving it a shot.

An unrelated question - {{ArrayBuffer}} duplicates this definition of {{++=:}} from BufferLike, and that's bad. Is the duplication needed because of some weird reason? If yes, I'd like to know, because it should be addressed.

{code}
override def ++=:(xs: TraversableOnce[A]): this.type = { insertAll(0, xs.toTraversable); this }
{code}
