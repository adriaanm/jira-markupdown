A slightly tweaked error message in lambda lift indicates the problem is that r's owner was not changed to the new $anonfun$1#27117:
```scala
error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not find proxy for case val x1#23793: Tuple2#1518 in List(value x1#23793, method apply#27718, anonymous class $anonfun$1#27717, value <local ScalaCompilerKiller>#12215, class ScalaCompilerKiller#6974, package <empty>#3, package <root>#2)  (currentOwner= List(value r#16190, value $anonfun#16186, value <local ScalaCompilerKiller>#12215, class ScalaCompilerKiller#6974, package <empty>#3, package <root>#2) )
```
