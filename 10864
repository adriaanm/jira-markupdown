Thanks a lot or reporting.

As weird as this seems, it is actually according to the Spec. 

Private fields are not inherited. So you can't select them from a value of the derived type. 

You can upcast and select the member, however.

{code}
object A extends A
class A {
  private var a: Boolean = false
  def run { (A: A).a = true }
}
{code}

This was changed under SI-7475. We double checked with Martin, and with the behaviour of Javac, which does the same thing. (Java doesn't have companions, but you can emulate the same thing with nested classes)
