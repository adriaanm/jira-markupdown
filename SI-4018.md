Type Constructor inference doesn't behave consistently across method calls and constructor invocations.

{code}
trait M[V[_]]

class Cls[V[_]](c: M[V])

object Cls{
  def apply[V[_]](c: M[V]): Cls[V] = new Cls[V](c)
}

object test {
  val c: M[Option] = new M[Option] {}
  new Cls(c)         // does not infer.
  new Cls[Option](c) // okay
  Cls(c)             // okay
}
{code}

Tested with Scala 2.8.1

this gets really nasty also with method invocations which do perfect inference until you introduce higher-kinded type arguments.

in the attached file you can see that for the first-order case this works:

{code}
def test( implicit sys: KSys, c: KCtx ) {
   val p = Factory.test( "Test" )
}
{code}

in the second-order case, the implicits are not found. if i add them explicitly, the compiler complains:

{code}
<console>:38: error: no type parameters for method test: (implicit sys: Sys[A,B],implicit c: A)Proc[A,B] exist so that it can be applied to arguments (KSys, KCtx)
 --- because ---
argument expression's type is not compatible with formal parameter type;
 found   : KSys
 required: Sys[?A,?B]
          val p = Factory.test( "Test" )( sys, c )
                              ^
{code}

so i need to annotate all types. this is a real show stopper for a larger generified library.
