Code:

{code}
class A(val x : Int)
class B(x : Int) extends A(x)
class C extends B(0) { def foo = x }
{code}

results in:

{code}
error: not found: value x
class C extends B(0) { def foo = x }
                                 ^
one error found
{code}

Class C should compile without error, with foo referring to the 'x' member of A.

Incidentally, no error is shown in the interpreter.

example works with
{code}
class B(y : Int) extends A(y)
{code}
