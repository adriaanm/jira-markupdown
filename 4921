This is a manifestation of scala having to guess whether TopLevelParent.I1 is a static class or not.  It guesses wrong.  See SI-3567 and r23284.  If the code can be believed it is supposed to realize this has happened and try the other way - or maybe "can be" means "...if someone implements it."
{code}
// Select nodes can be later
// converted in the typechecker to SelectFromTypeTree if the class
// turns out to be an instance ionner class instead of a static inner class.
{code}
