In section 10.1:
- `CharRef` is used in the production for `AttValue`, and not defined anywhere. Should be added to the production defining nonterminals to be "as in W3C XML".
- `CharNoRef` is used in the production for `CharData` in section 10.1, and not defined anywhere. It should be replaced by `Char1`. (Aside: the XML spec uses regexps such as [^&<"] to represent character classes `CharQ` and `CharA`. It would make sense to do the same here.)
- `CombiningChar` is defined in the production "as in W3C XML", but not used anywhere.
* {{XNameStart}} is defined to include {{BaseChar}} -- which contradicts the annotation "(as in W3C XML, but without ':'" and is incorrect, since {{BaseChar}} includes e.g. digits, which can't start names neither in XML or in Scala. Should be either copied from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameStartChar removing the initial ":" or defined as "{{NameStartChar}} _without_ {{':'}}" and {{NameStartChar}} included to the "as in W3C XML" production.
Terminals PI and CDSect are not defined either, but since the text states that Processing Instructions and CDATA Sections are not supported, this is a different subject -- see #5109.
Sorry I forgot this one in my initial report:

In section 10.2:
  * {{ElementPattern}} appears once in full (in the first production) and twice abbreviated as {{ElemPattern}}. For consistency with the rest of the non-terminal names in the section, I would just rename both to {{ElementP}}
Discovered one more -- again in section 10.2:

- ContentP1 is defined and never used. The production can be deleted, as the compiler really doesn't support processing instructions, CData sections, comments, or even references in patterns.
