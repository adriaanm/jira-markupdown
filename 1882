The return type you see is in fact an Iterator[String], so the documentation is correct.  There is no requirement that the return type of a method be exactly what is stated in the documentation, only that it conform to it.  (Were that a requirement, a very high percentage of methods would fail that test.)
{code}
scala> val x: Iterator[String] = "abc" linesWithSeparators 
x: Iterator[String] = non-empty iterator
{code}
