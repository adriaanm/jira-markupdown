The following code compiles and results in a ClassCastException at runtime (using scalac 2.6.1).
{code}
trait Comparator[T] {
  def compare(t1: T, t2: T): Boolean
}
val c = new Comparator[String] {
  def compare(t1: String, t2: String) = t1 <  t2
}
def cmp[T](ls: List[T], cmp: Comparator[_ >: T]) = cmp.compare(ls(0), ls(1))
val ls = 1 :: 2 :: Nil
cmp[Int](ls, c) // should not compile
{code}
This should not compile, as it is clear that String is not a supertype of Int. This is a severe bug, as it results in a circumvention of the type system.
