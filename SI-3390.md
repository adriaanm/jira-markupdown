r21791 caused the build to fail because closure elimination is unhappy, the diff seems to point in the direction of the named argument (keep clean)

```scala
MatchError: Deref(Field(Record(class Typers$$Typer$$$$anonfun$$noMetaAnnot$$1$$1,Map(value keepClean$$1 -> Deref(LocalVar(variable keepClean$$10)))),value keepClean$$1))
at ClosureElim.valueToInstruction(ClosureElimination.scala:191)
at ClosureElim$$$$anonfun$$analyzeMethod$$1$$$$anonfun$$apply$$1.apply(ClosureElimination.scala:172)
```
(In r21811) revert the revert of r21791 (fix constructor parameter annotations). close #3390. together with a new starr it builds. no review.
