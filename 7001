with Paul's recent experiments of priming type vars with the parameter's bounds, maybe a tweak to how we compute the "direction" in which we solve type vars based on the variance positions in which they occur could suffice for inferring Bar instead of Nothing in code like:

{code}
def foo[T <: Bar]: T = ...
foo // Nothing inferred, could infer Bar
{code}
