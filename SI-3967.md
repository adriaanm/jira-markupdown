{code}
scala> case class Foo(i: Int, j: Int)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(1,2)
res50: Foo = Foo(1,2)
{code}

It would have been more readable for Foo's toString to print something like:
{code}
Foo(i=1,j=2)
{code}
I tried looking back and found this: https://chara2.epfl.ch/r/515/

"The problem with the current implementation is that it adds a rather heavyweight method to every case class. This is a lot of additional code for not a lot of appreciable gain"

But I think toString has 2 differences:
 1. it is already a method implemented for the case class
 2. it is less heavyweight than productElementName (which switches according to an index). 

So if I have:
{code}
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
{code}

the toString can be:
{code}
public String toString() { return ScalaRunTime..MODULE$$._toString(this, "name", "age");}
{code}

where _toString is:
{code}
def _toString(p: Product, names: String*)
{code}
./partest --update-check --failed

Closing. Even if we wanted to, we can't change this in a backwards compatible way.

With 2.10.0 you will be able to add:

{code}
  override def toString = myCaseClassToString(this)
{code}

Where {{myCaseClassToString}} is a macro that can see the parameter names.

If the research into macro annotations bears fruit, you could shorten this to:

{code}
@myCaseToString
case class Person(...)
{code}

But we can't make any promises about that feature.

Unfortunately that reflection/macro API is still marked as experimental for 2.10.x, but you might find this sort of use case compelling enough to live with the possibility of a little flux.
Here is a [solution|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-user/lo_OXRluQEQ/oZSeNLsUWvMJ] given by Jason on the mailing-list, using macros in Scala 2.11:
{code}
import scala.reflect.macros.blackbox._
import scala.language.experimental._

object ToString {
  def toStringWithNames: String = macro toStringWithNamesImpl
  def toStringWithNamesImpl(c: Context): c.Tree = {
    import c.universe._

    
// class for which we want to display toString

    val klass = c.internal.enclosingOwner.owner

    
// we keep the getter fields created by the user

    val fields: Iterable[c.Symbol] = klass.asClass.toType.decls
      .filter(sym => sym.isMethod && sym.asTerm.isParamAccessor) // we should do more filtering here


    // print one field as <name of the field>+"="+fieldName
    def printField(field: Symbol) = {
      val fieldName = field.name

      q"""${fieldName.decoded.toString}+${"="}+this.$field"""
    }
    val params = fields.foldLeft(q"${""}")((res, acc) => q"${printField(acc)} + $res")

    
// print the class and all the parameters with their values

    q"this.productPrefix + ${"("} + $params + ${")"}"
  }
}
