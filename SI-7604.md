It is common, when using cygwin + jline, to set the -Djline.terminal=<terminal class> property.  While Scala supports jline 2.x where you can instead use the string "unix" or "windows" here, it does not support the same class names as standard jline.    Jline 1.x **only** supported custom terminals via class name, forcing users cross between jline 1.x and 2.x to use class names.   HOwever, if you wish to use the scala REPL in an environment with other jlines, you are now unable to specify "jline.UnixTerminal" as the terminal for cygwin, while jline 2.x vanilla handles this perfectly.

SO, what it comes down to is that if Scala is going to "shade" the classes, it should NOT break the the canonical settings of jline.  I see one of two options:

(1) Provide a hack so that unshaded settings that may be class names are shaded and attempted.
(2) Use a shaded property name (scala.jline.terminal) for configuring Scala's terminal.
I agree the correct move would be #3.  I'd even be willing to just accept regressions from moving to jline 2 and push users that need features to contribute upstream.  

they independently fixed e.g., https://github.com/jline/jline2/pull/13, https://github.com/jline/jline2/pull/15
Or maybe this is why.
```
/r/jvminfo/bin/dump-class jline |& grep jansi.internal
  call  jline.WindowsTerminal.getConsoleMode                  org.fusesource.jansi.internal.WindowsSupport#getConsoleMode
  call  jline.WindowsTerminal.getWindowsTerminalHeight        org.fusesource.jansi.internal.WindowsSupport#getWindowsTerminalHeight
  call  jline.WindowsTerminal.getWindowsTerminalWidth         org.fusesource.jansi.internal.WindowsSupport#getWindowsTerminalWidth
  call  jline.WindowsTerminal.readByte                        org.fusesource.jansi.internal.WindowsSupport#readByte
  call  jline.WindowsTerminal.setConsoleMode                  org.fusesource.jansi.internal.WindowsSupport#setConsoleMode
```
So sbt and scala will now use the same jline 2.x? Or sbt will continue to use jline 0.9.x/1.x and scala use jline 2.x? 

Will there be any issue with the fact that jline1 and jline2 have class name collisions?

I tested dist.tgz on

- Mac OSX 10.8.4
- Win7 64 bits
 - with cmd.exe
 - with cygwin inside cmd.exe
 - with mintty/cygwin
- Ubuntu 10.10 VM

All console stuff works fine (line wrapping, backspace, history, paste, arrows, reverse search). For completeness I'll try a win 32 bits when I have time.

I started to browse the recent commits in jline2 and was reminded that it has an ["expand event"](https://github.com/jline/jline2/blob/master/src/main/java/jline/console/ConsoleReader.java#L635) feature that defaults to true. So !! recalls the previous line and in general anything starting with ! may cause IllegalArgumentException.

For instance try typing `1 != 1` with this 925 build.

You may need to [call](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/a49722990655633c2c97ddf5699adf25bc8bea76/src/jline/src/main/java/scala/tools/jline/console/ConsoleReader.java#L92) `ConsoleReader.setExpandEvents(false)`.

Excellent point, I'd gladly see src/jline disappear in 2.11.x and 2.12.x
