It seems very strange that `mapValues` and `filterKeys` are not strict: Scala's collections are usually strict unless you request a view. This unexpected behavior seems like a recipe for subtle, unexpected bugs. However, [~meirmaor]'s suggestion to at least have a strict serialization mechanism seems like a reasonable workaround if fixing `mapValues` isn't in the cards.
