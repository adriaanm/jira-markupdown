I have just installed the 2.7.2 RC1 plugin. 

If I create a Scala class in a single file, I can use it without problem in Java. Great - thank you!

However, if I put a few Scala class definitions in a single file, then I get lots of problems highlighted in the Java editor (in the margin). Usually, it complains that the name of the class "cannot be resolved to a type". Also, I have had "method is undefined for ...". Confusingly, these errors don't get listed in the "Problems" view. if I go ahead and run the Java program, then it works.


Miles, the issue I mentioned about Organize imports seems related to this. From what I can gather the problem is not caused by having multiple Scala classes in the same file. It's caused by not having a Scala class with the same name as the file. It gets a bit more complicated though, so I will explain.

For example, assume a S.scala:

{code}
package stest
class S
class S1
class S2
{code}

The following Java works without issues (including Organize imports):

{code}
package test;
import stest.S;
import stest.S1;
import stest.S2;
public class J {
  public J() {
    S s = new S();
    S1 s1 = new S1();
    S2 s2 = new S2();
  }
}
{code}

If I remove "S s = new S();" it still works fine (assume no save actions):

Invoke "Organize imports" causing the "import stest.S;" to be removed and I get the errors in the editor as reported in the bug (but not in the Problems view and the code is actually compiled OK).

So, the class with the same name as the file name has to be imported for things to work correctly. If you don't even have a Scala class with the same name as the file name, then there's no chance of avoiding the bug even if you have a single Scala class defined in the file.

Finally, if you call "Organise Imports" when a given type has the red underline, then the import will be removed if it exists causing real compiler errors (shown in the Problems view).

If anything is unclear, please ask. (I am available in #scala as usual too)
