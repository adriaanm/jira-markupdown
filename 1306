Are you suggesting that:
{code}
(implicit i : Int) => {...}
// Or with type inference: implicit i => {...}
{code}
should be equivalent to:
{code}
(i : Int) => { implicit val _ = i; ... }
// Or with type inference: i => { implicit val _ = i; ... }
{code}
If so, I think it's a valuable addition to the language.
