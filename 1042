There are two separate issues at play:
* type `Nothing`, which has no Java equivalent. All Scala types involving `Nothing` will be awkward or unusable from Java.
* generic signatures for forwarders (static methods added to companion classes of top level objects) may contain unbound type variables (defined in super classes).

The second issue is more pressing, since it is plainly a bug. I opened another ticket, SI-1822, and link back to this ticket, to be revisited when SI-1822 is fixed.
