```scala
package week4
trait Expr//{
  case class Number(n: Int) extends Expr
  case class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr
//}
object exprs {
  def show(e: Expr): String = e match {
    case Number(x) => x.toString
    case Sum(l, r) => show(l) + "+" + show(r)
  }
  show(Sum(Number(1),Number(2)))                  
}
```
It doesn't work if the curly braces are uncommented
Please, see the attached file
There is no evidence of a bug from your screenshot; introducing the curly braces defines the subtypes of `Expr` in a scope that is not visible from the place you do the pattern match.

You can organize your code as:

```scala
sealed abstract class Base
case class Number(n: Int) extends Base
...

object test {
  def foo(b: Base) = b match {
     case Number(n) =>
  }
}
```

Or, if you prefer:

```scala
sealed abstract class Base
object Base {
  case class Number(n: Int) extends Base
}
...

object test {
  import Base._
  def foo(b: Base) = b match {
     case Number(n) =>
  }
}
```

The first option is probably easier to start with; some prefer the second to avoid introducing so many names at the top level.

But please direct followup discussions to the Coursera forums or to scala-user; JIRA is only for confirmed bugs.
