I conclude after briefly implementing this there's no sensible way to do it.  The spec says "A reference to any other member of the “null” object causes a NullPointerException to be thrown." It's hard to imagine anyone lobbying for that behavior as an improvement over the present behavior of pretending Null has no members beyond eq/ne etc.

But we can't pretend Null has no "===" method, which its type clearly indicates it does, and then immediately allow it to be implicitly converted to something else as if it's just another innocent Type minding its own business.  Therefore, I say: wontfix.
