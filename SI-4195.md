Test case:

{code}
  object Test_1 {
	var id0 = 5
	var ids = List(id0, id1)
	var id1 = 5
	
	//Error: Prints 50 instead of 55 
	ids foreach print
	
	def main(args : Array[String]) {}
  }
{code} 



Above test case should print 55, but it prints 50 instead, as second variable is not initialized at the time when, it is referenced.

 - Scala: 2.8.1
 - Java:  1.6.0_20
 - Operating system: Windows XP

Isn't it an error in every case? I mean maybe it is expected, but it is error prone and should be verified by default...

Thanks for suggestion, I will ask on mailing list next time :-)

Actually it's a duplicate of SI-399.
Well, argumentation in SI-399 seems to me very unconvincing. As far as I know compiler should do flow analysis and just issue an error when variable is used before declaration. This is not anything special, and in fact it works for normal functions:

{code}
class Foo {
  println ( this.foo )
  val foo = 1
  
  def fn {
	  //Error: bar used before declaration
	  //println ( bar )
	  //val bar = 1
  } 
}
{code}

I mean problem should not have anything to do with JVM - it's a matter of flow analysis in compiler.

Here, this is an excerpt from the most recent of the dozens of mailing list threads on the subject (in which I was asking someone else not to open this same ticket, because closing the same tickets over and over is not how things improve.)  Nothing is going to change here without an extremely well thought out proposal which encompasses mixin order, inheritance, abstract members, early defs, and all the many other complications.

This is not true.  Not that I design a lot of classes like this, but:
  
trait NotWeird {
  val a: Int = b + 1
  val b: Int = a + 1
}                                                                               
  
object OK extends { override val a = 5 } with NotWeird
object AOK extends { override val b = 5 } with NotWeird

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(List(OK.a, OK.b, AOK.a, AOK.b) mkString " ")
  }                                                                             
}                                                                               
// prints: 5 6 6 5

A "forward reference" may or may not be a forward reference.  We have
inheritance and overriding here.

You say that there is a lot of discussion about this issue on mailing lists. It clearly indicates that current behavior cause problems.

You also mentioned that it is very difficult to find solution. It is probably true, exactly as you said.

Anyway IMHO this issue still should stay open, till someone will find  a way to handle it cleanly. It's real issue as it can cause real problems in user code. Probably it will also be easier to redirect people to this issue (or earlier one) than explain everything over and over again.

I think you should consider to reopen issue.

Leaving a ticket open won't stop anyone from opening another one.  If there's one thing I've learned... and you did not exactly provide counter-evidence in this case.

I agree with you that the situation should be improved.  And indeed it is open: SI-4152.
