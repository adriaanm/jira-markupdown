I don't think it's directly related to overloading,  and implicit search seems completely in the clear for this one.
This is the smallest failure I think is representative:
```scala
class Bippy { trait Foo[A] }

class Implicits(val c: Bippy) {
  def f[A](x: A)(implicit ev: c.Foo[A]): Int = 2
}
 
class Test {
  val c = new Bippy
  (new Implicits(c)).f[Int](5)(null: c.Foo[Int])
}
```
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Test.this.c.Foo[Int]
 required: _23.c.Foo[Int] where val _23: Implicits

         (new Implicits(c)).f[Int](5)(null: c.Foo[Int])
                                          ^
```

adding the overloaded f produces a different error that indicates we got the existential's scope wrong:
```scala
 error: method f of type 
([A](x: A)(implicit ev: _25.c.Foo[A])Int) forSome { val _25: Implicits }
does not take type parameters.
         (new Implicits(c)).f[Int](5)(null: c.Foo[Int])
                             ^
```
