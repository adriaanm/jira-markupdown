Funny story.

I was working on getting the port of the FJBG reading code working (it at least compiles and appears to read method signatures correctly now, although it doesn't handle everything correctly yet). Once it compiled I started to put it under test. First thing I tested: Create a class, write it to a byte array, read it back again, make sure you've got something that looks about right.

Didn't work. For some reason the code array was coming back apparently empty. After staring at the Scala code and the Java code I really couldn't see any difference that would cause this. So I tried the same thing on the Java code and it broke in exactly the same way.

Looking through it in more detail: The constructor for ByteArray that takes an InputStream is broken. It doesn't set the position index correctly. Consequently if you read a ByteArray then write it it will write zero bytes. I've attached a test case that demonstrates this.

I think all you need to do to fix this is to 

{code}
  pos = size;
{code}

At the beginning of the constructor.
