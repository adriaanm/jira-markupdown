scala.plugin_2.6.1.B3

Eclipse menu Window / Preferences... / Scala / Scala Editor Preferences. [[BR]]
Checkboxes are hidden behind the list (that is, behind the select with options "comment", "keyword", "literal", etc). [[BR]]
I've uploaded screenshot [http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgsc2rjm_1gpwzdc there].
Is this still a problem on Windows? The preference dialog looks pretty ugly on Linux/GTK, but at least the checkboxes are visible.

Volunteers to tidy this up would be very welcome.

Just uploaded a patch which should take care of layout flaws.  I do a lot of SWT at work and this should look quite nice.
