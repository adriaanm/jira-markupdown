In the following example (I'm afraid I haven't been able to significantly reduce it further), the equivalence of `si.Out` and `si.instance.Out` has been lost at the call sites of `direct` and `indirect`.

Notice that in `direct` the type `si.Out` is known in the second parameter block at the call site, and so the expression typechecks. However in `indirect` the type `si.instance.Out` is unknown or, at least, is sufficiently opaque to prevent the second expression from typechecking. 

`si.Out` is defined in terms of the implicitly summoned `i`, so if `si.Out =:= i.Out` is available at the call sites of `direct` and `indirect` then intuitively it seems that `si.instance.Out =:= i.Out` (where `si.instance: i.type`) should be available too.

```scala
package si

import scala.language.{ higherKinds, implicitConversions }

trait Foo[T] { type Out }

object Foo {
  implicit def mkFoo1: Foo[Boolean] { type Out = Int } =
    new Foo[Boolean] { type Out = Int }
}

trait SI[TC[_]] {
  type T
  val instance: TC[T]
  type Out
}

object SI {
  implicit def conv[TC[_] <: { type Out }, T0](t: T0)
    (implicit i: TC[T0]): SI[TC] { type T = T0 ; type Out = i.Out } =
      new SI[TC] {
        type T = T0
        val instance: i.type = i
        type Out = i.Out
      }
}

object Test {
  def direct(si: SI[Foo])(v: si.Out) = v

  val v1: Int = direct(true)(23)    // OK

  def indirect(si: SI[Foo])(v: si.instance.Out) = v

  val v2: Int = indirect(true)(23)  // Fails
  // test.scala:35: error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : Int(23)
  //  required: si.instance.Out
  //   val i: Int = indirect(true)(23)
  //                               ^
}
```
I think you are looking at #6161. There are a billion examples of it.
Here it is with no use of implicits. It's pretty well killing my project.
```scala
trait CC[A]
trait HasElem[Repr] { type A }
object ccInt extends HasElem[CC[Int]] { type A = Int }

object Test {
  final class View[Repr, AIn](repr: Repr, val tc: HasElem[Repr] { type A = AIn }) {
    // For a time it's completely convinced AIn and tc.A are the same type.
    def equivalence1[B](implicit ev: B =:= AIn) = true
    def equivalence2[B](implicit ev: B =:= tc.A) = true
    def evidences = List(equivalence1[tc.A], equivalence1[AIn], equivalence2[tc.A], equivalence2[AIn]) // 4 out of 4

    // Foreshadow.
    def f1(p: AIn): AIn = p
    def f2(p: tc.A): tc.A = p
  }

  def xs: CC[Int] = ???
  val view = new View[CC[Int], Int](xs, ccInt)

  // No longer equivalent, transitivity lost.
  def g0 = List(view.equivalence1[Int], view.equivalence2[Int])
  // b.scala:33: error: Cannot prove that Int =:= Test.view.tc.A.
  //   def g0 = List(view.equivalence1[Int], view.equivalence2[Int])
  //                                                          ^

  def g1 = view f1 5  // compiles
  def g2 = view f2 5  // fails
  // b.scala:31: error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : Int(5)
  //  required: Test.view.tc.A
  //     (which expands to)  AIn
  //   def g2 = view f2 5  // fails
  //                    ^
}
```

I believe this provides a better look at Miles' reported problem:

```scala
import scala.language.{ higherKinds, implicitConversions }
 
trait Foo { type Out }
 
trait SI {
  val instance: Foo
  type Out
}

object Test {
  def test {
    def indirect(si: SI)(v: si.instance.Out) = v
   
    val foo: Foo { type Out = Int } = ???
    def conv(i: Foo): SI { type Out = i.Out; val instance: i.type } = ???
    
    val converted = conv(foo)

    val v1: Int = indirect(converted)(23)  // Okay (after refining the return type `instance` in the return type of `conv`)
    /*
    indirect(converted){(v: converted.instance.Out)converted.instance.Out}(
      23{Int(23)}
    ){converted.instance.Out};
    */

    val v2: Int = indirect(conv(foo))(23)  // Fails.
    /*
    indirect(
        conv(foo){si.SI{type Out = foo.Out; val instance: si.Test.<refinement>.type}}
    ){(v: si.instance.Out)si.instance.Out}(
      23{<error>}
    ){<error>};
    */

  }
}
```

First of all, I needed to refine `instance` in the return type of `conv`. Without that, I don't believe that one could expect this example to work.

However, after doing that, we can still see a difference between the case when the first argument to `indirect` is a stable value vs when it is a method call to `conv`. I've annotated the computed types in those expressions above.

```
actuals = SI{type Out = foo.Out; val instance: Test.<refinement>.type}
params =  value si
actuals.head.isStable = false
```

The unstable type of the argument is intentionally **not** substituted for `si`. This behaviour is a fix for a soundness hole, #3873.

My conclusion is that this isn't a bug. I'm going to mark it as such, but feel free to reopen if you think I've got it wrong.

I'll move Paul's test case over to #8177. It is a bug in as-seen-from.
Jason, I disagree with your analysis here. The reason for the soundness hole in #3873 is not that `new A` as argument for parameter `a` is unstable, but rather that it's not the same prefix as `val a`. Let's try replacing `new A` in the #3873 code fragment with a stable reference (and fixing it a little bit so we don't have bare methods and vals):
```scala
class A { 
  class B
  def b: B = new B 
}

class B {
  def f(a: A)(b: a.B): a.B = b

  val a = new A
  f(a)(a.b)
  f({ val fresh = new A; fresh: fresh.type })(a.b) // doesn't compile
}
```

You would find that the code still wouldn't compile, since `a-the-val.type#B` does not conform to `a-the-argument.type#B` (which is actually `fresh.type#b`). This is not analogous to what's going on over here in #7753 (at least in your example). The first way to test this is to make a similar substitution:
```scala
import scala.language.{ higherKinds, implicitConversions }
 
trait Foo { type Out }
 
trait SI {
  val instance: Foo
  type Out
}

object Test {
  def test {
    def indirect(si: SI)(v: si.instance.Out) = v
   
    val foo: Foo { type Out = Int } = ???
    def conv(i: Foo): SI { type Out = i.Out; val instance: i.type } = ???
    
    val converted = conv(foo)

    val v1: Int = indirect(converted)(23)

    val v2: Int = indirect({ val fresh = conv(foo); fresh: fresh.type })(23)  // Works now

  }
}
```
You will find that the code compiles now. But then, of course it does: this basically comes to the same thing as what you already had above with `val converted`! Anyway, I do think that there is enough constraint here to make the call soundly, and that you should reconsider your position. Oh, and something else you should try: turn `v2` into `indirect(conv(foo))\_` and you'll find that you get an `Int => Int`. *hmmmm*... Inconsistency in Scalac? That could never happen! Anyway, feel free to refute *my* analysis, as I could easily be missing some other factor that leads to unsoundness here.

While I'm at it, though, I'm extremely _unconfident_ that the "stability lambdas" above ({{\{val fresh = \_; fresh: fresh.type\}}}) should work (I actually only kept them in so I could make this point). They seem to be letting part of the type (namely its stability) escape into an outer lexical scope, which definitely seems iffy. What do you think?
Thanks for looking into this, Chris.

I tend to agree that the restrictions placed by #3873 didn't get to the essence of the unsoundness.

I also agree that the "stability lambda" (nicely coined!) is pretty dubious.

As you point out, this has an ill-scoped reference to `x` in the type of the block. Maybe it should be `x.type forSome { val x: String }`.

Here's an analagous situation where block typing widens to a structural type to avoid leaking a locally scoped type:

```scala
scala> {class A { def foo = 0 }; new A }
res1: AnyRef{def foo: Int} = A$1@23905e3
```

With regards to eta-expansion, that's no surprise as you currently can't express dependently typed functions in scala.
"They seem to be letting part of the type (namely its stability) escape into an outer lexical scope, which definitely seems iffy."

Why is that a problem? The "lexical" in "lexical scope" tells you what scopes are about: names. When properties of the value which can be expressed in the type without reference to its name are visible outside of the defining scope, that is the type system doing its job. That's what a type system is for.
retronym: regarding the ill-scoped x in that output, I'm having trouble making sense of it. Is it the type of the expression which is carrying an explicit type ascription, before the type ascription has been applied? In which case you're really seeing an implementation artifact.

I say that because the types look right when I do good old -Xprint:typer for both these cases. Looking at the positions where Singleton is shown for f, I see no way x could possibly be escaping. And in g it is given the correct existential type.
```scala
object Test {
  def f = { val x = ""; x: x.type }: Singleton
  def g = { val x = "" ; identity[x.type] _ }
}
// def f: Singleton = ({
//   val x: String = "";
//   (x: x.type)
// }: Singleton);
// def g: x.type => x.type forSome { val x: String } = {
//   val x: String = "";
//   {
//     ((x: x.type) => scala.this.Predef.identity[x.type](x))
//   }
// }
```
Here's one solution: create a refinement from the (unstable) type argument, and the singleton type over the parameter:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3486

That seems to get this ticket and #8223 to workingville without compromising safety in #3873.
To continue the escaping stability side-discussion, I will say that what you've said here and on #8223, I'm convinced not only that the stability *can* safely escape the scope, but that it would be a problem if it didn't. Obviously, the current implementation is still slightly "wrong", but at this time it doesn't seem all that pressing to fix it.
