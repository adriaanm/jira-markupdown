=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
  (new { def field = 0; def field_=(i: Int) = () }).field = 5 // compiles as expected
  (new { def field(implicit i: Int) = 0; def field_=(i: Int) = () }).field = 5 // compiles even with implicit params on getter
  (new { def field = 0; def field_=[T](i: Int) = () }).field = 5 // compiles with type param on setter
  (new { def field[T] = 0; def field_=(i: Int) = () }).field = 5 // DOESN'T COMPILE
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
According to the standard, "If x is a parameterless function defined in some template, and the same template contains a setter function x_= as member, then the assignment x = e is interpreted as the invocation x_=(e) of that setter function. Analogously, an assignment f .x = e to a parameterless function x is interpreted as the invocation f.x_=(e)".

I would expect the fourth case to compile as the getter has no parameters.
If I'm allowed to add type parameters to the setter and it still works, I'd expect to be able to add type parameters to the getter as well.


=== What do you see instead? ===
The fourth case doesn't compile and fails with "error: reassignment to val".

=== Additional information ===
Bug is possibly in method typedAssign in Typers.scala

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.6
the spec language means that the type parameter case should work as well, so it's a bug
(extempore in [r25048](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25048)) A getter with type params is still a getter.  Closes #4237.
There were two distinct bugs in here, which if I ran the world
would be a wakeup call that robust software cannot emerge from
thousands of lines of low-level AST matching.  In case you are
frozen in suspense: I do not run the world.  Review by moors.
