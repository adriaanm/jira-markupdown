Using Scala from Java, or from another language (like [http://velocity.apache.org/ Velocity] or [https://scripting.dev.java.net/ other scripting language]) is currently very troublesome: one have to forfeit Scala-aware types in favor of java.util.* Collections.
I propose for the scala.collection.jcl.* classes to implement corresponding java.util.* APIs, so that JCL collections can be used together with Java or any Collections-aware JVM language, while still being directly usable from Scala.
Retracted by OP in #67.
