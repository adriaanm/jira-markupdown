- remove ClassfileAnnotation (and the warning)
- introduce ConstantAnnotation do to exactly what ClassfileAnnotation does now, but without a warning
- make SerialVersionUID extend ConstantAnnotation

as discussed in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1924
Reading this actually clarified things a lot, and now I think the name's fine:

```
I'm not sure if we should follow java here. Scala has only two levels: The default (same as SOURCE in java) and persisted (StaticAnnotation, same as RUNTIME in java). All persisted annotations are visible in (Scala) reflection (and of course in the compiler). I think this works well and I don't see much reason for adding a third level.

The thing we are discussing here is completely orthogonal: it's is about enforcing constant arguments. It's just a tool we give to annotation writers. They should be able to use it with normal and with static annotations.

Java compatibility (i.e. writing java-compatible annotations), finally, is yet another orthogonal issue. To emit java annotations we'd need to enforce constants, and on top of that we might also want to support the three java persistence levels. The latter could be achieved with meta-annotations. But let's not confuse things here.
```

There's another question though. Why do we need a hardcode into the compiler to verify that something's a constant, when we have macros? Unfortunately unless we have type macros, it's out of the question though :(
