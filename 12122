What about the general Java interop issue? (Java methods of 0-22 parameters areÂ first-class in Scala, but methods of >22 aren't, right?)

I understand that this it's been discussed and accepted, but I wonder if folks continuing to ask about it might in itself be a reason to discuss it again.  Being forced to macros (experimental?) is a little scary/unlikely.  Did the previous discussion indicate a different future solution to the issue of not being able to interop with systems with >22 fields or >22 parameters?  

Cheers
