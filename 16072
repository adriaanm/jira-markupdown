= enhancement recommendation =

In both cases it may be OK to have both an individual entry "Deprecated" and "@deprecated" listed in "Annotations", duplicating the deprecation message (or displaying "..." which is even more useless") should be avoided.

Ideally, "@deprecated" should be shown without parens, message or ellipsis and the deprecation message should be shown in the separate "Deprecation" entry like it currently does.
