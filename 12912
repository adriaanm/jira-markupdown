change [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/changeset/13246 13246] does break method `Symbol.isAnonymousClass`.

Eg. in the following code:
```scala
class Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
  println((x: Int) => x * 2)
}
```
the anonymous class now gets a symbol with name `main$$anonfun$$1`, which is not detected
by `isAnonymousClass` anymore.
