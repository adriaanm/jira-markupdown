The error still occurs in the latest version of the plugin (2.7.0.14321-final_0).  To reproduce:

1. Extract the attached zip into an empty scala eclipse project.
2. Open the NaiveHeap.scala files in a window in eclipse.
3. Close eclipse.
4. Start eclipse.
5. On opening, it will show the NaiveHeap.scala window and give the error attached.
