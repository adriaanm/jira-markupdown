Running
```scala
import scala.actors._
//Actor.self
val channel = new Channel[Unit]
channel ! ()
```

results in
```scala
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at scala.actors.Channel.$$bang(Channel.scala:61)
        at Main$$$$anon$$1.<init>((virtual file):9)
```

This is probably because of how Channel.recv is initialised.
```scala
private[actors] var recv: Actor = {
  // basically Actor.self, but can be null
  Actor.tl.get.asInstanceOf[Actor]
}
```

If you uncomment `Actor.self` in the example snippet then the code works fine.

This error occurrs in 2.8.0.r17285-b20090312020918, but I'm pretty sure it's been around for a while.
