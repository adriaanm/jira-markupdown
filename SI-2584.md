fsc command in a command prompt produces this message.
scala and scalac work.
I set SCALA_HOME, JAVA_HOME, and added scala bin to a path in system properties and verified in using set command.
I also tried setting the same in a command prompt - fsc produces the same message.
The same scala version works on a different computer, also Win XP.

I use version 2.7.7 on Windows with Sun JDK 1.6.0_17.

Because of this problem, Netbeans plugin does not work.

Eclipse plugin works, though.

Hello, I tried a recent 2.8.0 nightly with Sun JVM 1.6.0_15, and all works here; that was without setting SCALA_HOME. We have not received any other reports of difficulties with fsc on Windows.

Fsc relies on the ability to establish a network connection with the local machine: it first starts a compilation server, which is left running in the background, and then it contacts that server via a socket connection with every new invocation of fsc. If you have a particularly strict firewall software installed on your machine, that may prevent fsc from contacting its own daemon.

If you are still experiencing this problem, you might try to adapt the firewall configuration so to allow local connections, or temporarily switching it off and try again. We are unable to reproduce this problem here, therefore we will close the ticket for the moment. Please reopen if you still encounter this issue.
