We have rather universal agreement on deprecating view bounds. We are missing a person who has time to deal with the whole deprecation process which in this case would include:

- writing a mini guide which includes rationale for deprecating view bounds and outlines migration strategies (examples discussed in this thread are a good start)
- write a code which warns about view bounds being used
- migrate our own code base so we don't have new deprecation warnings when compiling the library and the compiler
- update the spec

The following idea should probably be in the scala-internals thread, but since I'm far away from being a Scala committer I decided to post this here.
In advance, please forgive me any potential ignorance or lack of some fundamental knowledge if this idea is stupid.

In the scala-internals thread, Adriaan proposed a replacement for view bounds:

```
Given `class Has[To] { type Conversion[From] = From => To }`

`def foo[T <% Int](x: T) = (x: Int)`

can be rewritten to:

`def foo[T: Has[Int]#Conversion](x: T) = (x: Int)`
```

I think this could look a lot nicer if Scala had multiple type parameter lists:

```
Having: `type HasConvTo[To][From] = (From => To)`

`def foo[T <% Int](x: T) = (x: Int)`

can be rewritten to:

`def foo[T: HasConvTo[Int]](x: T) = (x: Int)`
```

Maybe this could be a good motivation for implementing multiple type parameter lists?
