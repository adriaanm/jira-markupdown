Joshua Bloch, when asked about backward compatibility and things he would like to change (Devoxx 2008):

> "It would be totally delightful to go through [Java] Puzzlers, 
> another book that I wrote with Neal Gafter, which contains all 
> the traps and pitfalls in the language and just excise them - 
> one by one. Simply remove them.

> There are things that were just mistakes, so for example ... 
> [misspeaks] ... int to float, is a primitive widening conversion 
> and happens silently, but is lossy if you go from int to float 
> and back to int.
> You often won't get the same int that you started with.

> Because, you know, floats, some of the bits are used for the 
> exponent rather then the mantissa, so you loose precision.
> When you go to float and back to int you'll find that you didn't

> So, you know, it was a mistake, it should corrected, it would

Locke would call that "Argument from authority" :-)
