After typechecking, we have `Test.this.orange.apply`. The position of the Test.this.orange is marked as “transparent” (since https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/3415436b67ae7889a11ce2537576ca49b328aecc), which means when we look for smallest tree that encloses the cursor we consider this ineligible, and instead focus on `Test.this.orange.apply`. The exception comes from the fact that the cursor is not in the name apply.

Seems to me that the outer, synthetic tree ought to be the “transparent” one, rather than the inner one. I’ll change that and see what breaks.
Will also see how this works in the IDE.
