I'd like to exclude certain packages and/or classes from Scaladoc's output, but I see nothing in its options that looks like it will satisfy.

For example, if my project consisted of:

foo.bar.Baz
foo.bar.Bif
foo.bar.BifImpl
foo.bar.impl.Bing
foo.bar.impl.Bang

I might like to exclude all of foo.bar.impl and foo.bar.BifImpl specifically.

I can control which source files are sent to Scaladoc, but that is insufficient for my purposes, both because AFAIK Scaladoc wants to actually compile things, in which case it needs all the source code. And in the project in question, the main author has chosen to put all source files in one top-level directory, instead of breaking them out by package. This makes excluding everything in the, for example, foo.bar.impl package more cumbersome.
You can now use 

{{scaladoc -skip-packages <pack1>:<pack2>:...:<packN> files.scala}}

or the ant {{skipPackages}} property to skip package expansion in scaladoc.
