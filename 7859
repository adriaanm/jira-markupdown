If that's supposed to mean me, you are absurdly out of line.  One of us spends half his morning diagnosing the other one's issues, not to mention having put at least a week into it prior to this. It's not like it's my personal bug - it's just one of those very difficult problems nobody else cares to tackle.

Meanwhile the other of us thinks reporting issues via mailing list chatter is good enough, and then when imposed upon to open tickets like everyone else, somehow has the nerve to completely omit the products of said morning's work.  If this is your usual mode of operation, your time must be valuable indeed.
