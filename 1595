OK, I've found the issue ... it's the Java Formatter which is controlling this behaviour.

I'll disable that, but as an immediate workaround got to Preferences => Java => Code Style => Formatter => New ... then enter a name for the new profile, then select "Tabs only" for Tab policy, select "Use tabs only for leading indentations" and set "Tab size" to 2.
