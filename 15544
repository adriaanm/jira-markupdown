I wanted to try the Scala actors and found a documentation which isn't very helpful. Some diamonds I found:

{code}
def   getState: Value
Returns the execution state of this actor.
returns the execution state 
{code}

That's what I could guess from the name. But which states are possible and how do they change?

or

{code}
def link(to: AbstractActor): AbstractActor
Links self to actor to.
to
the actor to link to
returns
    the parameter actor 
{code}

Is the link not used by the actor itself? If yes, for what? What happens if I link the same actors multiple times?

My questions were:[[BR]]
- How to build a robust network of actors that continues to work even if an actor crashes[[BR]]
- Can the receiver find the sender of a message?[[BR]]
- How can the sender determine if the receiver still works? Or does the framework restarts the receiver automatically?[[BR]]

The documentation wasn't very helpful!
