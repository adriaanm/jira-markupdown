Mixing pattern matching and continuations causes an surprising warning in 2.10.0-RC5, though the code compiles fine in 2.9.2

$ /usr/local/scala-2.10.0-RC5/bin/scalac -P:continuations:enable bug1.scala
bug1.scala:7: warning: expression matchEnd6(x: Int){
  x
} is cps-transformed unexpectedly
    x match {
    ^
one warning found

When the case analysis appears in a catch statement, the warning becomes a compiler crash that has a lot to say about itself.  I've attached the output of

$ /usr/local/scala-2.10.0-RC5/bin/scalac -P:continuations:enable bug2.scala
