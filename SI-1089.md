object Test extends Application {
  val l1 = List(1, "2")
  val l2 = for (i: Int <- l1) yield i+1

yields
{code}
Test.scala:3: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Int) => Int
 required: (Any) => ?

The method {{TypeBuilder.makeGenerator}} should transform the generator {{x: Int <- l1}} to
{code}
x: Int <- l1.filter {case x: Int => true; case _ => false }
{code}
since pattern is not irrefutable for type {{Any}} (the list's element type).
I am closing as a duplicate and consolidating under ticket SI-900.  See also SI-1673.
