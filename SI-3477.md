Had trouble dreaming up a one line summary on this one.
{code}
object Test {
  class J1 {
    def f[K, V](x: Map[K, V]): Map[K, V] = error("")
  }
  class J2 {
    def f[K, K1 <: K, V](x: Map[K1, V]): Map[K, V] = error("")
  }
  class J3 {
    def f[K, K1 >: K, V](x: Map[K1, V]): Map[K, V] = error("")
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    (new J1).f(Map[Int, Int]())   // ok
    (new J2).f(Map[Int, Int]())   // ok
    (new J3).f(Map[Int, Int]())   // not ok
    
    // error: inferred type arguments [Int,Int] do not conform to method f's type parameter bounds [K1 >: K,V]
    //      (new J3).f(Map[Int, Int]())
    
    ()
  }
}
{code}

There may be two distinct bugs, in that it fails to compile for some reason and then there is an error reporting bug which drops a type parameter.  I say that partly because it fails in 2.7 as well, but the error message has the right arity:
{code}
scalac27 b.scala 
b.scala:15: error: inferred type arguments [K,Int,Int] do not conform to method f's type parameter bounds [K,K1 >: K,V]
    (new J3).f(Map[Int, Int]())    
             ^
one error found
{code}
I can't see why it shouldn't compile when the constraint is trivially satisfiable, but I accept that limitation if it exists.  Still, the arity being wrong is the kind of thing that strikes fear into my heart about what else might be happening.  (That also applies to those HK messages which say things like "error: expected 1 type parameter, found 1", though maybe those are gone now.)
Mark, right, that's what was happening. The problem, though, is that all would be well if we inferred Nothing for K, but we were excluding it because Nothing is also used to indicate failure of type inference... mmh...

I have a [http://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commit/3937d0b4c5fda27d3c2f44dd36b01ae0c7f72c20 tentative fix] for this, but need to investigate the relation to SI-3152, which was fixed in r21128
Replying to [comment:5 moors]:
> Paul, I agree, let's look into that for 2.8.x

See also SI-1570.  (I think there are more floating about but I ran into that one by happenstance.) (Happenstance, that's a funny word.)
(In r22514) closes SI-3477. type arguments that were inferred to be Nothing should be included in checkBounds. wonder why they weren't in the first place

note that all type parameters must be reported in error messages about failing type inference, but only type parameters that were inferred successfully should be substituted

the idea of mapping type parameter symbols to the corresponding type ref in order to make substitution the identity does not seem to work, leading to errors like:

        src/library/scala/collection/immutable/SortedMap.scala:38: error: type mismatch;
          found   : scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap[A,B(in method empty)]
          required: scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap[A,B(in trait SortedMap)]
           override def empty: SortedMap[A, B] = SortedMap.empty
                                                           ^

(I guess that's why they were retracted before, but that wasn't done consistently, leading to SI-3152 -- my first attempt at fixing the latter lead to this bug... I've assigned  SI-3152 to you Martin, as I can't decide how to fix it.)

review by odersky
(In r22523) cleaned up the mess that resulted from cobbling together fixes for see SI-3477 and see SI-3152
adjustTypeArgs and methTypeArgs now return a LinkedHashMap[Symbol, Option[Type]]
TODO: check that type inference is still just as lightning fast as before
