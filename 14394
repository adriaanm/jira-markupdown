The compiler currently reports a single error for
```scala
abstract class A {
  def f: Int
  def g: Int

  val x: Int
  val y: Int
}

class C extends A {}
```
```scala
class C needs to be abstract, since value y in class A of type Int is not defined
```

If the developer iteratively addresses compilation errors, four compilations are required before the developer is sure that all required members are defined.

If the compiler reported
```scala
class C needs to be abstract, since method f in class A of type => Int is not defined
class C needs to be abstract, since method g in class A of type => Int is not defined
class C needs to be abstract, since value x in class A of type Int is not defined
class C needs to be abstract, since value y in class A of type Int is not defined
```
the developer could be sure after a single compilation.
