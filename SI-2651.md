Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19673-b20091116132603 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

In A.scala, B.scala, C.scala, and D.scala:
```scala
trait A[T]
trait B[T] extends A[T]
object C {
	new A[Int] {}
}
object D {
	def x[T](a: A[T]) = a
}
```

 1. Compile.
 1. Remove [T] from A
 1. Mark A.scala modified.  Only A.scala is recompiled, missing compile errors.
 1. Recompiling B,C,D produces compile errors in all three sources about not taking type parameters
 
(In r20376) Closes #2793, #2651, #2650, #2653. Review by dragos.
A class with type parameters is always considered to have changed, even if it isn't modified.

 1. Compile A.scala and B.scala above.
 1. Mark A.scala as modified.  B.scala is recompiled.

Using !BuildManagerTest:

```scala
$$ scala scala.tools.nsc.interactive.BuildManagerTest A.scala B.scala
compiling Set(A.scala, B.scala)
Changes: Map()
builder > A.scala
compiling Set(A.scala)
Changes: Map(trait A -> List(Changed(Class(A))[ tparams: List((type T,type T))]))
invalidate B.scala because parents have changed [Changed(Class(A))[ tparams: List((type T,type T))]]
compiling Set(B.scala)
Changes: Map(trait B -> List(Changed(Class(B))[ tparams: List((type T,type T))]))
builder >
```
Renaming a type parameter marks the class as changed in r20598.  For example:
```scala
class A[T]
```
to
```scala
class A[S]
```

causes clients of A to be recompiled.
Yes, that case now works, but this one doesn't (r20777):

A.scala, B.scala
```scala
trait A[T, S] {
  def x: T
}
class B[T] extends A[Int, String] {
  def x = 3
}
```

 1. Compile
 1. Switch order of `S`,`T`:
```scala
trait A[S,T] {
  def x: T
}
```
 1. Mark A.scala modified.  B.scala should be recompiled, but isn't.
I now think that the change wasn't suitable. For example this code should fire the change (with r20735 it doesn't):
```scala
trait A[T, S] {
    def x: T
}
```

changed to: 
```scala
trait A[T, S] {
    def x: S
}
```
(In r20854) Closes #2651
In r20855, renaming method type parameters and higher kinded dummy parameters mark the source as changed.  For example:

Change
```scala
 trait A[T[S], S]
```
to
```scala
 trait A[T[R], S]
```


Change
```scala
 trait A {
   def x[B](b: B): B
 }
```
to
```scala
 trait A {
   def x[C](b: C): C
 }
```
