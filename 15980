The following file compiles nicely with scalac, but makes scaladoc complain about an error (tested with Scala 2.8.1 and the 2011-02-24 nightly):
```scala
package org.example

// A randomly chosen Java annotation with corresponding enum:
import java.lang.annotation.{Retention, RetentionPolicy}

// The enum used as a constant in this annotation will be make
// scaladoc signal an error.
@Retention(value=RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)
object Dummy {}
```


The scaladoc output says that it found one error:
```scala
$$ scaladoc Dummy.scala 
Dummy.scala:8: error: annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: RetentionPolicy.SOURCE
@Retention(value=RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)
                                 ^
model contains 0 documentable templates
one error found
```

As the annotation+enum used here is part of the JDK, and not something I've whipped together myself, I don't think this is a duplicate of bug scala/bug#2764 (especially considering comments 30 and 31 in that bug).
