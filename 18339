Under certain circumstances, queriying {{knownDirectSubclasses}} from a sealed trait from within a macro yields an empty list. It seems to be related to compilation order. Perhaps related to SI-7567, SI-7046.

Minimised test case, to reproduce:

- {{git clone -b knownDirectSubclasses git@github.com:Sciss/play-json-sealed.git}}
- {{cd play-json-sealed}}
- {{sbt clean compile}}

*Observed behaviour:* Compilation fails with

{code}
[info] Compiling 3 Scala sources to /Users/hhrutz/Documents/devel/play-json-sealed/test/target/scala-2.10/classes...
[error] exception during macro expansion:

*Expected behaviour:* Should find the respective sub classes.
