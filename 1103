Another example of case classes only meeting half the equals contract:
```scala
scala> case class Foo(xs: Int*)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(1,2,3) == Foo(1,2,3)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> Foo(1,2,3).hashCode == Foo(1,2,3).hashCode
res1: Boolean = false
```
Equal objects must have equal hashcodes! I think this is a serious bug.
