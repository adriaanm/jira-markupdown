The null assignment in the following snippet is removed when compiled with -optimise which leads to different behavior and can result in memory leaks. It seems to be a bit of an edge case, since obj is a local var, but it is surprising nonetheless. I actually encountered this in a unit test testing for leaks, where a setup like below can be common.

```
object WeakBug {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    var obj = new Object {}
    val ref = new java.lang.ref.WeakReference(obj)
    obj = null
    System.gc()
    //Thread.sleep(500)
    assert(ref.get == null)
    println(ref.get)
  }
}
```
Basically I don't think we can eliminate any local stores to reference types because of gc and/or weak/phantom observability. For instance

```scala
def foo = {
  var x = new HumungoObject
  // use x
  x = new SmallObject
  blah()
}
```

The reassignment to x frees up the reference to the HumungoObject, making it elligible for gc and freeing up memory for blah() to work.

Maybe there are some heuristics we could use like eliminating a local store that's the last instruction of a method before a return or some such. But whatever we come up with is bound to catch relatively few cases and probably won't be worth the effort.
