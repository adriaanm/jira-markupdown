Attached is an already-simplified version of the framework used in my previous post. I use it to figure out what causing the compiler error. This framework is about marshalling and unmarshalling. The attached file contains 2 packges 'binding' and 'json':

binding:
  F.java (interface, stands for Marhsaller Finder)
  Af.java (an abstract implmentation of F)
  M.java  (marshaller)
  Mc.java (marshalling context)
  Mc.Sc (inner class within Mc, stands for Sub-context)

json:
  M.java (marshaller specific for json marshalling)
  Mc.java (marshalling context specific for json marshalling)


With the following code in scala, scala compiler gives me the illegal cyclic reference error:

  import json._
  val mc = new Mc

However, if I change the inner class Mc.Sc to be static nested class, the error is gone.
