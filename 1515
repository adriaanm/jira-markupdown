I think you need to synchronize on the `Timer` creation, to avoid a possible race where multiple `Timer` threads are created.

An alternative option might be to initialise the `Timer` as a daemon thread and just never cancel it. You can do this by using the Timer's other form of constructor.

This would mean the Timer thread lives forever, but that's already a possibility anyway. It will currently live forever if the `Actor` object is initialised, but the `Scheduler` is never started - admittedly an unusual situation!
