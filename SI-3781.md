I suppose we're in unspecified land here, but I think it'd be nice if we could say implicit methods don't move one in multiple directions away from non-implicit ones (by which I mean, make it implicit and now THIS works but THIS doesn't...) because it's rather tedious trying to push all that toothpaste back into the tube.
The behavior is as specified, and I would not know how to change the spec.
That said there's one sore point: The behavior of f _: You would expect that
{code}
   f _ == f(_) == (x => f(x))
{code}
But only the second equality holds. The reason lies i the parser. It eta-expands
`f(_)` immediately, but expands `f _` to something like `(f: ? -> ?)`. It can't do the eta expansion for f _ because it does not know how many parameters `f` has. So that's how the code paths diverge.

What to do about it? The proper thing to do would be to force eta-expansion
of `f _` in the typer. But I have been uncompfortable with `f _` anyway for a long time. It feels redundant with all the other possibilities we have for expressing
function values. So how about deprecating `f _` altogether?









Good point. That one is not covered by the alternative use of (_). You'd have to write
() => f which is a bit less nice. But It's still only a minor inconvenience and writing () => f might atcually help comprehensibility.

I would miss f _.  I use it a lot, although maybe there are other ways to do things.  Is there another way to turn a method into a function without knowing the arity first? Maybe that seems like a trivial thing but I get a lot of mileage in the repl, especially with java's ridiculously long everything.
