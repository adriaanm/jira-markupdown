Take the class
{code}
public class Fisk {
    public static class A {
    }
    public static A A = new A();
}
{code} 

When calling it from Scala:
{code}
    val fisk = new Fisk.A()
    val strupp: Fisk.A = Fisk.A
{code}

The compiler fails compiling it:
{code}
error: A is already defined as object A
public static A A = new A();
{code}

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1

This is hard to fix, because the Scala compiler considers all static members of `A` as part of a (fictive) companion object `A`. Adding a field called `A` makes the definition ambiguous. Even if you compile this with javac first, you won't be able to access members of A from Scala. For instance:

{code}

public class Fisk {
    public static class A {
        public static void foo() {
            System.out.println("foo");
        }

        public int bar = 10;
    }
    public static A A = new A();

    public static void test() {
        int x = Fisk.A.bar;
        Fisk.A.foo();
    }
}
{code}

{code}
class Foo {
  Fisk.A.bar
  Fisk.A.foo()
}
{code}

you get:

{code}
isk.scala:2: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both variable A in object Fisk of type Fisk.A
and  object A in object Fisk of type object Fisk.A
match expected type ?
  Fisk.A.bar
       ^
Fisk.scala:3: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both variable A in object Fisk of type Fisk.A
and  object A in object Fisk of type object Fisk.A
match expected type ?
  Fisk.A.foo()
       ^
two errors found
]}}
But this JAVA-code works (of course):
{code}

	public void stuff() {
		Fisk.A a = new Fisk.A();
		Fisk.A b = Fisk.A;
		int i = Fisk.A.bar;
		Fisk.A.foo();
		b.foo();
		i = b.bar;
	}
{code}

This strikes me as strange as Scala is supposed to be, at least to my knowledge, 100% compatible with JAVA, but surely isn't as we've demonstrated here.

Is this something you Scala-guys will take a note of and plan to address, or will it end up on the infamous incompatibility-list?

I've attached simple single-line usecase project, that depends on play-framework 2.3.
It compiles on scala-2.10.x without problems, but fails on 2.11.x with messages mostly similar to this issue.

Steps to reproduce: download, unpack, sbt compile. The only source code file is conf/routres. Sbt will download deps, generate router source code into target/scala-2.11/src_managed/main and take a try to compile it. It will fail with:
{code}
[info] Compiling 4 Scala sources and 2 Java sources to /target/scala-2.11/classes...
[error] conf/routes: routes is already defined as object routes
[error] conf/routes: routes is already defined as class routes
[error] conf/routes:6: ReverseAssets is already defined as class ReverseAssets
[error] GET  /assets/*file                      controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)
[error] conf/routes:6: ReverseAssets is already defined as class ReverseAssets
[error] GET  /assets/*file                      controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)
[error] conf/routes:6: ReverseAssets is already defined as class ReverseAssets
[error] GET  /assets/*file                      controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)
[error] conf/routes: Routes is already defined as object Routes
[error] 6 errors found
[error] (compile:compile) Compilation failed
{code}

target/scala-2.11/src_generated/main contains java-source (in controllers/ subdir) with final static variables and inner static classes. Scala files contain inner classes, but DO NOT calling java-variables and inner-classes directly. So, this usecase slightly differs from original issue description.
