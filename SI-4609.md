Would be great to have, on Iterator[A]
{{{
  def nextOption() : Option[A] = if (hasNext) Some( next() ) else None
}}}

Often I want to get the possibly-first item from an Iterator
You mean well, but this should have been a mailing list discussion, with support gathered there, before becoming a ticket.

The bar for adding new methods to collections (Iterator isn't a "collection", but you know what I mean) is actually now quite high, as explained by Martin at http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language/msg/17c1769bd50adb0d and Paul at http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language/msg/98fbb9f0f145c0b8 .

You need to put together more of a case, much more, than "I wanted this the other day, can you add it for me, after all why not?"  The presumptive answer to "Can we have...?" is very much NO.  The collections API already has about a billion methods. That means "enough already", not "one more won't hurt."

On the other hand, if you have a time machine and you set the controls to 2005 or so, you can sneak all sorts of questionable stuff in that will still be there in 2011 ;-)

By the way, do you know about BufferedIterator? That's what I use if I want to peek at the next item. Or, maybe BufferedIterator wouldn't be helpful in your particular use case. I don't know, because you haven't shown us your use case yet, either on the list or here...!

And anyway I try to avoid Iterator, because it's stateful and this leads to much confusion and woe, as discussed at http://groups.google.com/group/scala-internals/browse_thread/thread/f9048e8fd9e0264 . Adding more methods to Iterator specifically (as opposed to the ones that flow down from TraversableOnce) is like throwing good money after bad. If I found myself wanting nextOption, my first response would be to back up and rethink.

Or perhaps I'm wrong and your use case is really compelling!  If you think it is, you should post it to the list and see what people say.
