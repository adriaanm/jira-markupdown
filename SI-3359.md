It looks like there's some code that was commented as Temporary in the forkjoin Actors library, but it hasn't been updated/fixed; this code causes an instant crash on Android when calling start().

Relevant code: https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/forkjoin/scala/concurrent/forkjoin/ForkJoinTask.java#L1010

Backtrace: http://paste.pocoo.org/raw/oAoOMWIpracd4a6BJOJ9/

There are at least two ways to work around this problem. One way is to disable the fork-join pool (falling back to a thread pool that does not use `Unsafe` intrinsics) by setting the `actors.enableForkJoin` JVM property: `-Dactors.enableForkJoin=false`. Another way is to re-configure the global actors scheduler:

{code}
import scala.actors.Scheduler
import scala.actors.scheduler.ResizableThreadPoolScheduler

Scheduler.impl = {
  val s = new ResizableThreadPoolScheduler(false)
  s.start()
  s
}
{code}

Schedulers can also be overridden on a per-actor basis:

{code}
import scala.actors.scheduler.ResizableThreadPoolScheduler

object MyConfig {
  val scheduler = {
    val s = new ResizableThreadPoolScheduler(false)
    s.start()
    s
  }
}

trait MyActor {
  override def scheduler = MyConfig.scheduler
}
{code}

I tested Actors on my device running {{Android 1.5}} and on an emulator running {{Android 1.6}}. 
The dalvik VM on these OS versions isn't capable of ignoring missing methods when loading a class. You will always be greeted with a crash just by loading the {{scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinTask}} class.

On android 2.1 dalvik is a little bit more resilient:

As the current actors implementation depends on the forkjoin library (calling Actor.start() will load the {{ForkJoinTask}} class) it doesn't work at all on {{Android}} 1.5 and 1.6 devices.

I will not change the status of this ticket as I think you guys should decide whether targeting 1.5 and 1.6 devices is worth the effort.


Thanks for testing, igorrumiha. After more digging I think the reason Dalvik is being forced to validate and initialize ForkJoinTask is because ActorTask inherits from ForkJoinTask indirectly via RecursiveAction, and ActorTask is instantiated regardless of which scheduler is being used.

So far, the only place I've seen where this inheritance matters is in ForkJoinScheduler.scala, line 121, where a Runnable is cast to a RecursiveAction.

Eliminating this inheritance looks like it prevents the crash on Android 1.5 but it also breaks a bunch of tests.
