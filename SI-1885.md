The display view is a really useful part of the Eclipse Debugger. It lets one type in bits of code and evaluate them in the context of the current program state.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for Scala at the moment. If I try to evaluate an expression I get:

Evaluation failed. Reason(s):
		String index out of range: 0

This happens even for really simple expressions like "1", or "1+2".
