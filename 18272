Just recently, `ExecutionContext` was edited with this:
```scala
  def reportFailure(@deprecatedName('t) cause: Throwable): Unit
```

Since then, it is taken as having a member, `name: String`.
```scala
  /code/scala cat sandbox/name.scala
trait T extends scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext { val name = "" } // false "needs override modifier" error
```

Analysis by Johaness Rudolph (thanks!)
```scala
class strangeTest(x: Symbol) extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

object X {
  val T = 't
}

trait A {
  @strangeTest(X.T) def test(x: String): Unit
}

// compile separately
// trait B extends A { val test = 12 }
```
