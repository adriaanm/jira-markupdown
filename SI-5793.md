Including a definition in a for comprehension works if the comprehension is using Option, but the compiler complains about a for comprehension with Either (RightProjection).  

Using for comprehensions makes for very readable code, and flowing though errors via Either seems like it ought to be the right thing to do.  

Example:

```scala
def opt:Option[Char] = Some('e')
def f(c:Char):String = "ha"
def either:Either[Int,Char] = Right('r')

val optComprehensionWithAssignment:Option[Int] =
  for {
    c <- opt
    x = c.toInt
  } yield x

val eitherComprehensionNoAssignment:Either[Int,String] = 
  for { 
    c <- either.right
  } yield {
    val s = f(c)
    s
  }

val eitherComprehensionWithAssighment:Either[Int,String] = 
  for { 
    c <- either.right
    s = f(c)                // doesn't compile
  } yield s


val workaround:Either[Int,String] = 
  for { 
    c <- either.right
    s <- Right(f(c)).right       // workaround's a bit awkward
  } yield s

```
You are essentially trying to call:

```scala
scala> either.right.map(x => x).map(x => x)
<console>:9: error: value map is not a member of Either[Int,Char] with Product with Serializable
              either.right.map(x => x).map(x => x)
                                       ^

```

But `Either#RightProjection#map` returns an `Either`, which doesn't have a `map` method.

You can enrich `Either` to have a right-biased set of `map/flatMap/foreach` methods, along these lines (I'm using Scala 2.10 implicit classes for brevity, but the same is possible in 2.9.x with a class and an implicit conversion):

```scala
scala> implicit class RightBiasedEither[A, B](val e: Either[A, B]) extends AnyVal {
     |   def foreach[U](f: B => U): Unit = e.right.foreach(f)
     |   def map[C](f: B => C): Either[A, C] = e.right.map(f)
     |   def flatMap[C](f: B => Either[A, C]) = e.right.flatMap(f)  
     | }
defined class RightBiasedEither

scala> 

scala> def f(c:Char):String = "ha"
f: (c: Char)String

scala> def either:Either[Int,Char] = Right('r')
either: Either[Int,Char]

scala>   for { 
     |     c <- either
     |     s = f(c)
     |   } yield s
res0: Either[Int,String] = Right(ha)
```
Thanks Jason.  That's very helpful.  I understand the flaw in Either now.  Your solution is nice both to explain and to try out.

That the stock unbiased Either requires a bit more syntax to use the RightProjection/LeftProjection is apparent from the api, but because of this design flaw it's hard to recommend Either.  

Is there an open issue on fixing Either?  Or a consensus that it's not fixable?  Seems like the standard lib should get some combination of a fix, interim documentation, or a replacement.
