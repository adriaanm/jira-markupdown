Please see attached file for example. it is true for all scala versions,
Sorry, but the attached source is not valid Scala.

Using a Java API in Scala doesn't mean you can also write Java-in-Scala.

If you write it in Scala, it works correctly:

```scala
myList
  .stream()
  .filter(s => s.startsWith("c"))
  .map(_.toUpperCase)
  .sorted()
  .forEach(println)
```
