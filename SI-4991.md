The following code compiles, but gives NullPointerException when foo.Foo.bar is called in REPL.

package object foo {
  type Foo = Int
}

package foo {
  object Foo {
    def bar = 1
  }
}

- Case 1
scala> import foo._
import foo._

scala> import Foo._
import Foo._

scala> bar
java.lang.NullPointerException

- Case 2
scala> foo.Foo.bar
java.lang.NullPointerException

- Case 3
Running "println(foo.Foo.bar)" as a single Scala script gives the correct result and does not crash the compiler.
Same example {foo => t4991}.  One source file.

Under separate compilation of a client using 2.10, scalac emits the same class file error; but compiling together works.

```scala
# footnote, 2.9.1 is unhappy compiling pkg obj after 2.10 without cleaning
$ scalac t4991.scala
??? base trait ScalaObject not found in basetypes of object t4991

# 2.10

We need a determination on what's supposed to happen when there is a type alias with a name which would be an object's companion class if it had one.  Right now there are a bunch of ways for it to fail, because none of the code which hops between related classes was written to take this into account.  It is made yet buggier by the fact that the type alias and object have different owners (the package object class and the package class.)
Martin: only classes can be companions, type alias should not be considered
top-level type aliased (in package objects) conflict with the top-level class that's created speculatively before parsing a class file

synonymous class and type alias in the same scope is not allowed -- can we delay creating the class symbol without knowing we need to? 

object and type alias should be allowed to co-exist (however, class and type alias is not allowed)
