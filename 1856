Great! Thank you very muck for such a quick responce!
Just in case, code to reproduce this bug. Now it is fixed, I confirm it.

import scala.actors._
import scala.actors.Actor._

object Ticket1948 {
  def main (args: Array[String]) {
    val actors = (1 to 1000).toList map { x => actor { loop { react {
      case x: Array[Int] => reply ("OK"); exit }}}
    actors foreach { x => x !? new Array[Int] (1000) }
  }
}
