with 2.7.1final and also 2.7.0 and using Java 5 on solaris 10
there is a compiler assertion failure related to importing and using attached .class file

the error starts with 

   1  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed
   2    at scala.Predef$$.assert(Predef.scala:87)
   3    at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.ClassfileParser.parse(ClassfilePar
ser.scala:59)

Scala code is very simply:

     1  import org.jboss.cache.Fqn;
     2  object X {
     3  val fqn:Fqn[String] = null
     4  }

note that the Fqn class is part of 3rd party jboss-cache 2.1 in the jbosscache-core.jar so i did not compile this file.

Also the java version of the above scala code does compile with java 5 javac on solaris.

i attache a zip file with just the Fqn.class
