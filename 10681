This is a change in behavior in comparison with 2.10.x (regression?).

FreeTypeSymbol is now designated as volatile, which prevents: 1) pattern matching against vals of such type, 2) extension methods that return such type. If I change `FreeTypeSymbolApi with Symbol` to `Symbol with FreeTypeSymbolApi`, it makes everything work fine, but then erasures of Symbol and FreeTypeSymbol start clashing.

I have several questions actually:
1) Is the change in volatility correct? FreeTypeSymbol transitively extends AnyRef, so why is it volatile?
2) Why do we disregard extension methods that return volatile types?
