without toString: can't existentially abstract over parameterized type K[Int]
This seems similar to #7645 (especially the [2nd comment|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7645?focusedCommentId=68798]).
Or #5252. I just noticed that quick search on "duplicate field" doesn't yield the results I expected. That is duplicate resolution.
