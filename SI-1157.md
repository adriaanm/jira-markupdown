CVS decorations are doubled in package explorer.
r15653 is in use.
The only way I can get this effect is by having multiple {outgoing_change_flag} entries configured as text decorations. Please reopen if you're able to provide a reliable way of reproducing this problem.

Some things it would be helpful if you would investigate ... Is it possible that you've managed to get an {outgoing_change_flag} duplicated somehow?

Also, I'm using the built in CVS Team provider along with Subclipse rather than Subversive ... could you check if the behaviour you're seeing is present with no Subversion plugin installed, or with Subclipse?
I have scanned all the .metadata dir for outgoing_change_flag - the only file with the context (org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui.prefs) is shown below - nothing doubling.

And, Miles, this is an additional info which probably is a good reason to reopen the issue: _ **only** Scala files has the problem_. Decorations of all other file types are fine. Sorry, have missed this important nuance on opening the ticket.

r15731 is in use currently.
