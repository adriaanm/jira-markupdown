It's actually using `Chars.isLineBreakChar` to count lines, so embedded '\r' also is counted.

Since the clients of `pos.line` really are interested in the source line in the usual sense, the fix is to count lines using line endings in the restricted sense.  Then `pos.lineContent` should conform, too.

It would be kind of neat if `pos` meant the Scala view (after Unicode escapes) so that `pos.finalPosition` would yield the "raw" position.  But there doesn't seem to be any demand (or use case).  The scanner knows about line breaks, but after that, `line` returns to its quotidian connotation.
