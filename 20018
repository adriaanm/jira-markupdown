Given the following source:

{code:scala}
package m

object Thing {
  /**
    * Demonstrates a scala issue in which the closing link tag is duplicated
    * <a href="https://very-link">much title</a>
    */
  def apply(args: List[String]): Unit = {
  }
}
{code}

Scaladoc outputs the following code (formatted and annotated):

{code:html}
<p class="shortcomment cmt">Demonstrates a scala issue in which the closing link tag is duplicated
  <a href="https://very-link">much title</a>
  </a> <!-- this should not be here and is invalid -->
</p>
<div class="fullcomment">
  <div class="comment cmt">
    <p>
      Demonstrates a scala issue in which the closing link tag is duplicated
      <a href="https://very-link">much title</a>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
{code}
