Are you really getting different answers for tpe.dealias.typeSymbol and tpe.typeSymbol? How? Calling typeSymbol normalizes!

Just to throw some cold water on this: you should not be inspecting typeSymbols directly, that's what leads to all these aliasing bugs; you should definitely be scared to call rawInfo; and when did dealias turn up on Symbol...
