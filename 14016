This appears related to the use of internal exceptions to handle flow control logic.  While that may (or may not) be necessary, the compiler should really be buildable with assertions disabled.  In a related matter, there are many spots in the code that catch either "case _: Throwable" or simply "case e" and both of those will get involved with everything they see, whether or not they ought to.  This situation is masking bugs and impeding debugging.

Here is the failure I get attempting to build scalac.
```scala
[scalacfork] Compiling 405 files to /scala/trunk/build/quick/classes/library
