Here's a workaround for a few of those cases where you have control over the call-sites:

Put a definition like at a place where it can be seen from the call-sites of `map` etc.

{code}
implicit def possiblyParallelCanBuildFrom[Elem]: CanBuildFrom[GenSeq.Coll, Elem, GenSeq[Elem]] =
  if (isPar)
    ParSeq.canBuildFrom[Elem].asInstanceOf[CanBuildFrom[GenSeq.Coll, Elem, GenSeq[Elem]]]
  else
    GenSeq.canBuildFrom[Elem]
{code}

You can, of course, only use it if you manage to pass isPar around, as well. Overall not very usable in the end but it did work for us in one place because we configured isPar globally anyways.
