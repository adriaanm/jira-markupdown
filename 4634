  6.6.5 Example: Default-Access Fields, Methods, and Constructors

  If none of the access modifiers public, protected, or private are specified, a class member or constructor is accessible throughout the package that contains the declaration of the class in which the class member is declared, but the class member or constructor is not accessible in any other package.

  If a public class has a method or constructor with default access, then this method or constructor is not accessible to or inherited by a subclass declared outside this package.
