The following compiled with Scala 2.8.1:

```scala
@annotation.tailrec
def lazyFilter[E](s: Stream[E], p: E => Boolean): Stream[E] = s match {
  case h #:: t => if (p(h)) h #:: lazyFilter(t, p) else lazyFilter(t, p)
}
```

In 2.9.0 and 2.9.0.1, I get:

```scala
  error: could not optimize @tailrec annotated method lazyFilter: it contains a recursive call not in tail position
```

To my understanding, the method is tail recursive, as the first occurrence of "lazyFilter" is not a call, but a closure that is passed to cons.

I'm not sure if this only a bug in the evaluation of @tailrec, or if the 2.9 compiler really cannot apply tailrec optimization here anymore. In the latter case, it would affect the Stream class as well.

Could you please clarify about this.

Thanks.
