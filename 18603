Sometimes I'm forced to use a deprecated method.  I need to filter these case by case, so that the warnings remain useful generally.  I do appreciate these warnings and act on them when I can, but if my build output becomes overrun with warnings I can do nothing about, I will eventually just ignore them all.

I've open this but to clarify scala/bug#1781
