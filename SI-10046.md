Here is a snippet to illustrate the problem:

{code}
class Foo[A] {
  def compose(a: Foo[A]): Foo[A] = new Foo[A]
  def compose(b: Bar[A]): Bar[A] = new Bar[A]

  // non overloaded method
  def composeBar(b: Bar[A]): Bar[A] = new Bar[A]
}

class Bar[A] {
  def compose(a: Foo[A]): Bar[A] = new Bar[A]
  def compose(b: Bar[A]): Bar[A] = new Bar[A]
}

object Test {
  val fooS = new Foo[String]
  val barS = new Bar[String]
  def barA[A] = new Bar[A]

  // foos and bars compose together
  fooS compose fooS
  barS compose barS
  fooS compose barS
  barS compose fooS

  // here it fails with the following error
  // error: overloaded method value compose with alternatives:
  // (b: Bar[String])Bar[String] <and>
  // (a: Foo[String])Foo[String]
  // cannot be applied to (Bar[Nothing])
  fooS compose barA
  
  // but it works if you add a type annotation or a non overloaded method
  fooS compose barA[String]
  fooS composeBar barA
}
{code}

This issue is particularly important for monocle because all optics (Iso, Lens, Prism, ...) compose together which means we need to define 8 different compose methods instead of a single method overloaded 8 times.
In case this could be an incentive to fix this issue, the test case compile just fine in java:
{code:java}
class Test {
  static class Foo<A> {
    Foo<A> compose(Foo<A> a) {
       return new Foo<>();
    }
    Bar<A> compose(Bar<A> b) {
      return new Bar<>();
    }
  }

  static class Bar<A> {
    Bar<A> compose(Foo<A> a) {
      return new Bar<>();
    }

    Bar<A> compose(Bar<A> b) {
      return new Bar<>();
    }
  }

  static <A> Bar<A> barA() {
    return new Bar<>();
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Foo<String> fooS = new Foo<>();

    // Compile just fine:
    fooS.compose(barA());
  }
}
{code}
This kind of limitations means that the scala user-experience (of java 8 libraries in particular) can be inferior to the java user-experience. Resolving regressions vs Java 8 should, imo, be given major priority (at least from a marketing pov ;-)).
Maybe the missing param type exception for function literals can be extended to this case, so that a single missing type param is inferred from the type args of the candidate expected types.

Problem statement:
{code}
scala> class D[A] ; class C[A] { def f(x: C[A]): C[A] = new C[A] ; def f(x: D[A]): D[A] = new D[A] }
defined class D
defined class C

scala> def d[A]: D[A] = new D[A]
d: [A]=> D[A]

scala> new C[String]().f(d)
<console>:14: error: overloaded method value f with alternatives:
  (x: D[String])D[String] <and>
  (x: C[String])C[String]
 cannot be applied to (D[Nothing])
       new C[String]().f(d)
                       ^
{code}
This is not a workaround.
{code}
scala> class D[A] ; class C[A] { def f(x: A => C[A]): C[A] = new C[A] ; def f(x: A => D[A]): D[A] = new D[A] }
defined class D
defined class C

scala> def d[A]: D[A] = new D[A]
d: [A]=> D[A]

scala> new C[String]().f(x => d)
<console>:14: error: overloaded method value f with alternatives:
  (x: String => D[String])D[String] <and>
  (x: String => C[String])C[String]
 cannot be applied to (String => D[Nothing])
       new C[String]().f(x => d)
                       ^

scala> new C[String]().f(x => d[x.type])
<console>:14: error: overloaded method value f with alternatives:
  (x: String => D[String])D[String] <and>
  (x: String => C[String])C[String]
 cannot be applied to (String => D[_ <: String with Singleton])
       new C[String]().f(x => d[x.type])
                       ^
{code}
At the moment, I can see one way to fix the issue but I am very unfamiliar with the internal API. Here is what I found so far:

In Typers -> preSelectOverloaded, we could try to remove overloaded candidates that cannot match, e.g. there is no way that a Bar[A] can be a Foo[String]. If we can do that then the issue would be resolved because there would be only one alternative. However, it seems that the Tree barA hasn't been type checked in preSelectOverloaded, so I don't know how to access type information.
