Given the following Java class:

```scala
package jfiles;
public abstract class DataView<T> { protected DataView(T id) { } }
```

When trying to extend this class in Scala with

```scala
package sfiles
import jfiles.DataView
class myDataView extends DataView( "String" )
```

I get the following error:

```scala
sfiles/myDataView.scala:3: error: constructor DataView cannot be accessed in package sfiles
class myDataView extends DataView( "String" )
```

If the Java class has a public constructor, this works without a problem!

To get the above Scala source compiling with the protected version, I need to give a hint on the type:

```scala
package sfiles
import jfiles.DataView
class myDataView extends DataView[String]( "String" )
```

Hmmm.  When you supply the type parameter, here's what the superconstructor access check looks like:
```scala
checkAccessible(
myDataView.super.<init>,
constructor DataView,
myDataView.super.type,
myDataView.super)
```
When you leave it off, here's what it looks like:
```scala
checkAccessible(
new [<deferred> <param> <java> T]jfiles.this.DataView[T][T].<init>,
constructor DataView,
jfiles.this.DataView[T],
new [<deferred> <param> <java> T]jfiles.this.DataView[T][T])
```
In other words it looks like if the type parameter is still unknown, the access check it performs is whether it can instantiate the superclass rather than extend it, which will naturally fail in this very case - the protected superconstructor.  (I don't know why it shows [T][T] or whether that's indicative of anything important.)

This is not caused by #1240 like #1840 is, but it is well within the range of the issues I'm talking about in my comment to #1840.
