It is quite bad implementation in "size" method of scala's LinkedList.

{code}
trait LinkedListLike … { self =>
  
  override def length: Int = if (isEmpty) 0 else next.length + 1
{code} 

This way leads us to linear stack growing while algorithm iterates over collections. Every call of "next" goes to stack and after thousands or hundreds elements we have StackOverFlow error. 

And time consumption is too large even with small number of elements.

It would be better to realize "length" and "size" methods without recursion (now it's not tail-recursion!). Something straitforward like Java's one:

{code}
trait LinkedListLike … { self =>
  
  override def length: Int = {
    //Pseudocode!!!
    if (isEmpty) 0 {
      var iter = this.iterator
      var counter = 1
      while(!iter.next.isEmpty) {
        counter += 1
      }
      counter
    }
  }
{code} 

It's not so compact as now but it will work 10 000 times faster and without StackOverflow.
