I have a PR that failed in the parallel collections scalacheck.  The test would work for result size < 512 because it would fall back to sequential.  This was my first time using scalacheck in anger and despair, and I am persuaded.

Looking forward to the new tool. Should we propose names on scala-debate? Scoff-laws for scala collection f-in' laws.
