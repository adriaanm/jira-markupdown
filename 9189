In 3, what's T? Do you mean type X = B? If so, it makes sense; I proposed to have this *as an option*, because sometimes allowing C and making the hierarchy less GADT-like makes sense.
I'm missing some details, but it's not clear why there's no answer with unchecked Variance and without variant aliases. Gotta look at newBuilder.
