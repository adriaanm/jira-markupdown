And by the way. The same strange thing goes with Range object. Inside its 'foreach' method has written
```scala
    if (fullLength > 0) {
      val last = this.last
      var i = start
      while (i != last) {
        f(i)
        i += step
      }
      f(i)
    }
```

but it goes 8-10 slower than the same while-loop wrote outside.
