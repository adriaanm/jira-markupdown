= problem =

Main problem is that it's hard to find the actors documentation located at http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/actors-api/actors_api_guide.html#

This patch includes a link in the package scaladoc

Patch also includes a lot of minor tweaks to make things consistent.  Added a few examples of things and converted some stuff to a newer wiki syntax.  This package could use a *lot* more TLC, but I'm not super familiar with this library to write some better docs.  This is a decent cleanup.
