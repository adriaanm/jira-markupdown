Navigate to http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/scala/collection/immutable/HashMap.html .  Click the link to HashMap.scala, near the top of the document.  If you are using Internet Explorer (I'm using IE 7) you get taken to http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/api/scala/collection/immutable/ .  In Firefox (I'm  using 2.0.0.11) you get taken to http://scalasvn.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashMap.scala?view=markup
Actually a redesign isn't necessary; it just requires some time to fix the Javascript incompatibilities between IE and other browsers is (after several attempts I gave up with IE because of its missing debugging support).
