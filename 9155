One might say that this behavior is warranted by SIP-17: http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/type-dynamic.html. Here's a relevant excerpt:

* If qual.sel is followed by a type argument list \[Ts\] (optionally) and an argument list (arg1, …, argn), where none of the arguments argi are named, and argn is not a sequence argument, i.e., of the shape e: _* (the argument list is required, though it may be empty), as in: qual.sel\[Ts\](arg1, …, argn), rewrite the expression to: {{qual.applyDynamic\[Ts\](“sel”)(arg1, …, argn)}}

* If qual.sel is not followed by arguments or an assignment operator: {{qual.selectDynamic\[Ts\](“sel”)}}.

If we follow the letter of the SIP, then {{x.bippy}} in {{x.bippy("arg")}} is followed by an argument list, hence it should get desugared into applyDynamic, not selectDynamic. Do you agree?
