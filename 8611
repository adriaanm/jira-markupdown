Thanks for taking time to investigate this.

It appears that any fix for this will take at least two releases--one to introduce a fix behind a flag and then make that flag default. If this doesn't get any kind of fix in 2.11, it will be at least another couple of years before there is a final fix. Given how long this has stayed open (and the original scala/bug#4214 that was reported three years back) with no definitive approach in sight and backwards compatibility argument only getting stronger with (hopefully) increased Scala adoption, come 2.12, I fear it may not have any better chance of getting fixed.
