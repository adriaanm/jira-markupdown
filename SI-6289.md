1) Create a directory `myBug` in `neg` in Partest with:

file_1.scala:

```scala
class Const { val x = 1 }
```

file_2.java:

```scala
public class file_2 {
    public static void foo() {
        Const c = new Const();
        c.x = 2;
    }
}
```

Running:

```scala
test/partest --show-log test/files/neg/
```

gives:

```scala
Testing individual files
test/files/neg/myBug/file_2.java:4: error: x has private access in Const
        c.x = 2;
         ^
1 error
testing: [...]/files/neg/myBug                                        [  OK  ]
All of 1 tests were successful (elapsed time: 00:00:02)
```

although there is no `check` file with the produced output.


2) Also, there are no compilation errors being printed out for `run` tests.
The problem is that javac writes errors to stderr which is not checked in RunnerManager#runCommandImpl().

I have a fix which redirects stderr to stdout, but the implementation is a hack as I don't see how to do the redirection when using scala.sys.process._. I'm gonna spend some more time on it. (Another solution could be the -Xstdout option of javac, but it's non-standard, so I'd rather avoid it.)

Or maybe stdout and stderr should be handled separately? E.g. stdout is checked against **.check and stderr is checked against **.check-err
My partest refactor from last summer (which collided with the other partest refactor) used javax.tools to run javac and collect errors, and does fail the example.

I dimly recall that other useful messages include: are all my compile groups free of deprecations, or whatever.  I had ambitions for using all the outputs.

This code had a small performance boost, but not a killer feature. I guess this would be a minor feature.

```scala
Testing compiler (on files whose compilation should fail)
testing: [...]\files\neg\mybug                                        Error! x has private access in Const

I just read that the computer keyboard is one of the top ten germiest spots in the house, after the kitchen sponge but before the kitchen sink.

One reason is the people drooling over partest in color:
