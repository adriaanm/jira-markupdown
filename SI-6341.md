When parsing XML and then writing it out again, the order of attributes is reversed.

This prevents certain use cases where one wants to modify an XML file and have a minimal amount of changes. E.g. adding a new element to a file causes all existing attributes to get reversed.

The cause is here:

https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/81e3121eb09010375783d13e8c4c853686a34ffd/src/library/scala/xml/parsing/MarkupParser.scala#L302

aMap: MetaData is built by prepending new attributes to the linked list, causing the reversal.

The attached patch adds a failing test case. (It failed when I wrote it originally, now I can't test it because the build fails).
This is a duplicate of #3441 and #2735, except that there are a few different parsers at issue: the compiler's MarkupParser for literals, the library's MarkupParser, and the utility methods that use xerces, IIUC.
```scala
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val input = """<elem one="test" two="test2" three="test3"></elem>"""
    val doc = XML.loadString(input)
    println(doc)
    
    val cpa = ConstructingParser.fromSource(io.Source.fromString(input), preserveWS = true)
    val cpadoc = cpa.document()
    val ppr = new PrettyPrinter(80,5)
    println(ppr.format(cpadoc.docElem))
  }
```
I remember this issue from the first Scala code I ever wrote, but I haven't used XML since then, so bear with me.  My solution was a hook in PrettyPrinter for formatting attributes:
```scala
      // in leafTag and startTag; but also Utility.toXML/serialize
      //n.attributes buildString sb
      formatAttributes(n, sb)
```
I realize now this was my first fold ever:
```scala
  override protected def formatAttributes(n: Node, sb: StringBuilder) {
    //n.attributes.toList.reverse.foldLeft(sb) { (a,b) => a.append(' '); b.toString1(a); a }
    (sb /: n.attributes.toList.reverse) { (r,v) => r.append(' '); v.toString1(r); r }
  }
```
And maybe the last time I used /: except as an emoticon.  I see toString1 is protected now, so cut/paste that, too.  I don't know if such a formatAttributes hook is worth it?
Yes, this is about the library's MarkupParser, see description. #2735 was about the compiler's literal parser, so this is not a duplicate. But it's a similar issue.

The above is merely a workaround, but thanks anyway.

It should really be fixed so that round-tripping does not change things around needlessly.
I have raised a copy of this in the new space as https://github.com/scala/scala-xml/issues/65
