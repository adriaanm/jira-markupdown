There is no defense for having a "standard" option which is only useful for compiling the scala library.  A -X or -Y option would be better, but that just clutters the next set.  It should be a "-Z" option, only for guys like ourselves.

    It's not giving a path and telling the compiler to compile everything in there.

    Basically, sourcepath allows you to compile the standard library without anything
    on the classpath. The compiler will create class symbols for source files based
    on their path and name.


Oh, ok. I think it would be good to somehow make this setting less visible. If you go here: http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/tools/scalac.html
-sourcepath <path>
Specify where to find input source files. 


This description gives no clue what this option is about.
-sourcepath is also used in the presentation compiler. And it seems pretty standard:
{code}
$ javac -help 2>&1 | grep sourcepath
  -sourcepath <path>         Specify where to find input source files
{code}

EDIT: regarding the -sourcepath semantics clash in scalac vs scaladoc, the meeting decision was to disable the bootstrapping semantics from sourcepath when running scaladoc. So (still) WON'T FIX, sorry.
It does something sensible for end users in javac.  It does not appear to do the same thing for scalac, which is why it should be hidden behind -X or -Y.

a/A.scala:

{code}
package a
trait A {
   def x: a.B
}
{code}

a/B.scala:

{code}
package a

class B {
        val x = 3
}
{code}

Run:

{code}
$ scalac -sourcepath . a/A.scala 
a/A.scala:4: error: type B is not a member of package a
	def x: a.B
                 ^
one error found
{code}

It doesn't find a/B.scala like javac would.  This is why the original report quoted:
