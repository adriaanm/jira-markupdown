Hi, I can't confirm as I don't know which file it is anymore and I haven't reproduced it again, but it's very possible. I thought it might be related when you filed your issue (I intended to mention it, but let it slip), and I think it would make sense to mark one of them as duplicate.

Even though this was filed earlier, yours has more and better information, so I'll mark this as a duplicate following the approach that Miles has used in the past.

Duplicate of SI-3078.
