The following code shows erroneous errors in the Scala plugin:
{code}
package foo

case class Foo(v: Int) {
}

object Foo {
}
{code}

both class and object Foo are underlined and hovering reveals that 'Foo is already defined as object Foo' (even for the object itself). When opening the file for the first time, no error is shown. This happens only when editing. 

The 'Problems' panel is empty, so this is not a proper error (exists only in the annotated source).
