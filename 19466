According to SLS, a type in value definition(in method definition, too) is not determined by the local type inference, so

{code}
scala> val p = "hello"
p: String = hello

scala> val v = p : p.type
v: p.type = hello
{code}

seems ok, but

{code}
scala> def v = p : p.type
v: String
{code}

. Or SLS is wrong?
