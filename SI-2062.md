scala.Ordered defines

{code}
def compareTo(that: A): Int = compare(that)
{code}

which is the same signature as java.lang.Comparable#compareTo

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T)

So if I have a class that mixes in scala.Ordered it would be nice
not to also have to mix in java.lang.Comparable.
