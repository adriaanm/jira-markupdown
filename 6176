So first thing I learned from your transcript is that 1.6.0_24 is out on OSX.  I find that for whatever reason my java preferences kept 1.6.0_22 around and were still using that.

Switching to 1.6.0_24 made no difference, I still see ctrl-D working.  I mention it because next I tried openjdk and then I saw what you see.  So this I cannot explain.  It's something environmental, but I don't think the jvm is the direct reason: more of a proxy.
