Consider this code:

```scala
trait Queue[T] 
object Queue {
    def apply[T](xs: T*): Queue[T] = new QueueImpl[T](xs.toList, Nil)

    private class QueueImpl[T] private (
        private val leading: List[T],
        private val trailing: List[T]
    ) extends Queue[T]
}
```

It fails (which is correct (and it works with a non-private constrcutor)), but the error message is wrong in Scala >= 2.9:

```scala
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.runtime.StringAdd
 required: Queue[T]
           def apply[T](xs: T*): Queue[T] = new QueueImpl[T](xs.toList, Nil)
                                            ^
```

It is correctly reported in 2.8 though:

```scala
error: constructor QueueImpl cannot be accessed in object Queue
           def apply[T](xs: T*): Queue[T] = new QueueImpl[T](xs.toList, Nil)
                                            ^
```
I just created a Jira account so that I could report this bug; turns out it's already here, but closed!?

This may not be a compiler "bug", but it is a HUGE programmability/usability/API problem. I spent almost an hour trying to figure out why the compiler thought that "keychain <ins>= key" meant "keychain = (keychain.toString </ins> key.toString)" (which obviously fails to compile) after I split one class into two (so 'protected' was no longer permissive enough).

A bad diagnostic message is a programmability bug: the compiler fails to tell me what's really wrong.
Are you referring to
