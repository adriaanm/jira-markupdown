It would be great if reflection could add support for DocDef Nodes (scala.tools.nsc.ast.Trees#DocDef). The use case is source code generation. Being able to add doc comments would make tree based (e.g. quasi quote based) source code generation more feasible. We could use this in Slick, but it should be useful in other cases as well, like adding assisting comments when printing out trees generated by macros for visualization or debugging in the IDE.
[~burmako], can this issue be closed or is the original request still on the table?
