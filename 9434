fwiw, a simpler way to reproduce it in 2.10.1:
```
scala> Stream(0).toArray
(succeeds)
scala> Array(0) ++ Stream(0).toArray
(fails)
scala> Stream(0).toArray
(fails even though it succeed before)
```

this came up on IRC a while back and I was tardy about reporting it. pleased to see it's fixed already :-)
