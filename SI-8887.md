Not sure how to fix this, but its worth spinning this issue out of #8876, which was about use cases.


```scala
Full Signature
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That
```

Disambiguating:

```scala
def map[B, That](f: ((A, B/*a type parameter of class Map*/)) ⇒ B /*a type parameter of method map*/) ...
```
