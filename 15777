Sometimes between r23407 and r23427 we lost script stack traces:
```scala
object Test {
  throw new Exception
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  }
}  
```
```scala
% /scala/inst/scala-2.9.0.r23427-b20101101134858/bin/scala Test
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
%  
```
It's a pretty sure bet it's one of my commits but I can't look into it this second, so ticket.
