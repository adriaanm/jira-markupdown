A colleague pointed out that `Map.transform` does a lot of what I want (except it requires a new map to be structurally built - it's strict, unlike my preference above)

- I'm adding this comment in case anyone else stumbles over this issue and wants a workaround
- It's pretty astonishing that it is possible for an experienced Scala dev to be able to peruse the type signatures of Map's methods and completely miss that a method with the signature they were looking for already exists (impossible to tell from the CBF version, of course!). Use-case on map being what it is and all :-(
