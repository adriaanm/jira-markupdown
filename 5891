I side with Miguel here. Confusing parameterless methods with nullary methods is generally bad. We have to do it for Java methods, because otherwise we'd always have to write toString(). We then also should do it for Scala methods, because otherwise migrating a Java class to Scala could break arbitrary clients. But there's not reason to generalize this. It's a kludge, not a virtue!
