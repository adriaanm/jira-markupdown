I take it that this was never pursued. With JDK 8 (Oracle) [officially disabling _Thread.stop_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-compatibility-guide-2156366.html), the above would be trimmed down to just attempting an interrupt (hoping the code is interruptible). Cancelling a run doesn't seem to do anything to break out of long-running code.

Like the description says, you could rewrite looping constructs to be interruptible, but that doesn't do anything for external code being referenced inside the REPL.

Just seems like something that would be nice to have, but maybe it's too much to ask for.
