_On the nondeterminism_

If I am correct the bug can be reproduced only one time per Eclipse session even if you use different names every time you execute the above test case. For example you execute the above steps with project name _test1_ and then when you try again with the name _test1_ or _test2_ the bug does not get reproduced. To observe the erroneous behavior again you have to restart Eclipse.
