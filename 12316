Another problem caused by this import optimization reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17103 :
```scala
scala -Yrepl-class-based

scala> import java.io.File
import java.io.File

scala> class Test {val f=new File(".")}
<console>:11: error: not found: type File
       class Test {val f=new File(".")}
```

If we cannot get the correct wanted imports, I would suggest just removing this wrong optimization.
