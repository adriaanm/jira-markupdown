the file {{scaladoc.properties}} looks like

version.number=${scaladoc.version.number}

the quick fix would be to change
{code}
    <staged-build with="locker"   stage="quick" project="scaladoc" version="scaladoc"/> </target>
{code}

to
{code}
    <staged-build with="locker"   stage="quick" project="scaladoc" /> </target>
{code}

no idea why we were using scaladoc.version.number -- I can't see it being defined anywhere
