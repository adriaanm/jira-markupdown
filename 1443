Replying to [ticket:1584 spiralhead]:

Just tried newest version 2.7.7 on Eclipse 3.5.
Followed instructions as in this append. Except defined it:
{code}
Object HelloWorld extends Application {
   println("Hello World!")
}
{code}
Launching as Scala application does not find static main method.
Cleaning the project as recommended here resolved the issue.
