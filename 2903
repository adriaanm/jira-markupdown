To Paul's comment, I agree that looking at the type parameters as curried, partially applied from left to right (SI-4719) is probably usually good enough.

If {{State\[S, A\]}} has pseudo-Haskell-ish kind {{(\*, \*) -> \*}}, then {{State\[S\]\[A\]}} would have kind {{\* -> \* -> \*}}, and {{State\[S\]}} would have kind {{\* -> \*}}.
