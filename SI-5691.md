In:

```
def foo[Byte](arr: Array[Byte]) { }
```

the type parameter for the polymorphic method is almost certainly an error. It would be nice for the compiler to emit a warning if the name is already a type name in scope or if the type name is a well known type like one of the `AnyVal` types.

I stumbled on this issue after an innocent search/replace changing an `A` type to `Byte`. See [this post](http://groups.google.com/group/scala-language/browse_thread/thread/18b0c15e86cd2f38/1f5a9fbe79c6731f?show_docid=1f5a9fbe79c6731f) for more context.

I think the warning is worthwhile because the error messages can point to advanced topics of Scala and are mis-directing the user on the resolution. For instance:

```
def foo[Byte](pred: Byte => Boolean, acc: Array[Byte]) = { 
  val (taking, rest) = acc.span(pred) 
  val x: Array[Byte] = acc ++ taking 
  val a = Array[Byte]() 
} 
```

shows those error messages:

```
 found   : scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Byte] 
 required: Array[Byte] 
         val x: Array[Byte] = acc ++ taking 

(error message: could not find implicit value for evidence parameter 
of type scala.reflect.ClassManifest[Byte]) 
```

Similar errors are leading to questions on stackoverflow. See

I know there are more (just wasn't able to find them).
