Using Stack.push gives me the following error:

{code}
error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method push in class Stack of type [B >: Int](B*)scala.collection.immutable.Stack[B]
and  method push in class Stack of type [B >: Int](B)scala.collection.immutable.Stack[B]
match argument types (Int)
    s.push(1)
      ^
{code}

It seems like SI-978 has regressed. I attach a patch against trunk with a testcase and a fix.

Also, since Stack.push could not be used properly, should there have been a compile error or warning?
