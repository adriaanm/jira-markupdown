object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }

Gives the following compile error:
```scala
scala> object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: Int
       object Foo { def foo: Int = for (x <- 1 to 10) { "hello" } }
                                        ^
```
I appreciate that the single value "hello" is useless there.  The caret seems completely misplaced; I'd expect it to go at the start of the for or before the final brace.
