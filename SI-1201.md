In 2.7.1 final

```scala
{ object Bar ; Bar }
```
causes type error
```scala
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Bar.type(in object $$iw) where type Bar.type(in object $$iw) <: Bar with Singleton
 required: Bar.type(in value res0) forSome { type Bar.type(in value res0) <: Bar(in value res0) with Singleton; type Bar(in value res0) <: java.lang.Object with ScalaObject }
       val res0 = 
```

Whereas the somewhat similar code 
```scala
{class Bar; new Bar()}
```
results in
```scala
res1: java.lang.Object with ScalaObject = Bar$$1@6f9f88
```
The first example should probably result in a ScalaObject with Singleton or similar.  And, in fact, explicitly typing the block solves the problem
```scala
{object Bar; Bar}:ScalaObject with Singleton
res2: ScalaObject with Singleton = Bar$$2$$@189b9bd
```


This may be related to #1195
ScalaObject might be all that should be inferred.  That's what this code unifies to:

> object Bar
> object Foo
> var x = 1
> val foo = if (x == 1) Foo else Bar

foo: ScalaObject = Foo$$@103c520
any chance of this bug getting some attention? there are a lot of ways to trigger this: see also #1195, #4171, plus this one (very similar to #4171) I found today:
```
scala> { class A; class B extends A; classOf[B] }
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : java.lang.Class[B(in value res4)] where type B(in value res4) <: A with ScalaObject
 required: java.lang.Class[_ <: A with ScalaObject]
       val res4 =
           ^
```
