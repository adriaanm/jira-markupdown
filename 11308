IIUC, the only approach you could try would be to use more inheritance:
```scala
trait A{ trait Foo }
trait B extends A {
  trait Foo extends super.Foo { def xxx = 0 }
}

// extension
trait C extends B with A {
  type AFoo = super[A].Foo
}

object Test extends App {
  val c = new C {}
  val afoo = new c.AFoo {}
  afoo.xxx // does not compile
}
```
