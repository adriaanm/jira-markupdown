I recently did some refactoring on my Scala code and later realized that
I had a private method that was no longer used.

It would be great if the Scala compiler could warn about these to indicate
programming errors.

For example, this should generate a warning since do_nothing is not
used.

{code}
class Test {
  private def do_nothing = 10
}
{code}

Currently, we can use findbugs to find these, but having the compiler
do them would be much nicer.

Are you suggesting that one use findbugs instead of having scalac warn you?  I find this an odd resolution given there isn't a native lint tool for Scala.

I don't disagree with Adriaan -- there are one or two lint tools in development that build on top of the compiler infrastructure (eg. scalastyle), and this would make a great feature for these.

But in the meantime, here an experimental implementation: https://github.com/paulp/scala/commit/386464fe. Not really suitable for an end-user at it is based on the generated bytecode, so the warnings might refer to mangled names, etc.

BTW, IntelliJ highlights unused privates.


I agree, I'd rather see the Scala compiler developers spending time on core language features, e.g. more optimizations, that we would use all the time then a compiler warning, or a compiler platform.

The issue I had with closing the ticket was the "Out of Scope" resolution, which doesn't seem accurate, as a compiler is one place to check for programming errors.  What about adding another "Will not implement" and provide the limited resources as a reason in the comment?  I wouldn't have been so adamant about this issue then :)
