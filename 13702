unfortunately, low ceilings on maximum command line length are not yet a thing of the past. Windows still has a 32K limit, even from Cygwin (the limit is higher when one Cygwin program calls another, but is still 32K even when scalac is invoked from Cygwin). so I have a lot of files I want to compile all at once, I can't do it on Windows since there is no alternate way (that I can see) of getting the filenames to the compiler. javac lets you use @ to pass them in a separate file.

in practice, users are much more likely to hit this limitation now that mixed Java/Scala projects are supported and all source files in both languages are passed to scalac all at onceâ€” that's why I am only hitting this issue now :-)

32K may sound like a lot, but given the Java requirement (not just convention, but requirement) of storing source files in a nested directory hierarchy corresponding to the package naming hierarchy, it's actually pretty easy to hit the 32K limit
