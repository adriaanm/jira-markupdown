(In r20710) One of those "$$.05 for the bolt, $$50,000 for knowing where to
put it" commits.  Closes scala/bug#425, scala/bug#816, scala/bug#2310, scala/bug#2691.  All credit
for this patch goes to me for having the genius to know when
new eyes were needed (although if you're feeling generous some
could also go to walter korman for the actual debugging and
code writing part.)
