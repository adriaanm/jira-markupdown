Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r20423-b20100109151851 (Java !HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17)

Given A.scala, B.java:
{code}
class A extends B

public class B {}
{code}

 1. Compile
 1. Mark B.java modified (without actually modifying it).  Build manager recompiles A.scala.
Duplicate of SI-2280
The following is for -make:transitive, not the refined build manager.

Clients of changed Java sources are not recompiled:

A.java
{code}
public class A { public void x() {} }
{code}

C.scala
{code}
object C { (new A).x }
{code}

{code}
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
{code}

Rename A.x to A.y:
{code}
public class A { public void y() {} }
{code}

Recompile:
{code}
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
{code}

No error is generated.  Removing .scala_dependencies and recompiling causes the error to show up properly.

Also, Java sources are always processed.

{code}
$$ scalac -Ydebug -Ybuild-manager-debug -make:transitive A.java
{code}

shows A.java being processed each run.
