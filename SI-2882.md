Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r20423-b20100109151851 (Java !HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17)

Given A.scala, B.java:
```scala
class A extends B

public class B {}
```

 1. Compile
 1. Mark B.java modified (without actually modifying it).  Build manager recompiles A.scala.
Duplicate of #2280
The following is for -make:transitive, not the refined build manager.

Clients of changed Java sources are not recompiled:

A.java
```scala
public class A { public void x() {} }
```

C.scala
```scala
object C { (new A).x }
```

```scala
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
```

Rename A.x to A.y:
```scala
public class A { public void y() {} }
```

Recompile:
```scala
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.java C.scala
```

No error is generated.  Removing .scala_dependencies and recompiling causes the error to show up properly.

Also, Java sources are always processed.

```scala
$$ scalac -Ydebug -Ybuild-manager-debug -make:transitive A.java
```

shows A.java being processed each run.
