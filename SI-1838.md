Accodirng to spec:
The sealed modifier applies to class definitions. A sealed class may not be directly inherited, except if the inheriting template is defined in the same source file as the inherited class. However, subclasses of a sealed class can be inherited anywhere.

But sealed modifier also is ok to traits and class or traits members.
When the spec talks about classes in this context, traits are automatically included. It makes no sense for fields or methods though, except for some unspec'd reason. This compiles:

```scala
class A {
  sealed def f = 0
}
```

Hence, this is really a compiler ticket.
