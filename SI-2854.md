Consider the following piece of code:
```scala
val queue = new ReferenceQueue[Array[Byte]]
val buf = new ArrayBuffer[SoftReference[Array[Byte]]]
buf += new SoftReference(new Array[Byte](100), queue)
// ...more element being added, and other things happening...
buf.clear
```
This code works with a list of `SoftReferences` and when done, just clears the list to ged rid of them. This should have the following effect:

1. The `SoftReferences` are not referenced any more, so they eventually get freed by the garbage collector,

2. Subsequently, the byte arrays also get freed.

So the `buf.clear` basically has the intended effect. However, this does not work with Scala's current `ReferenceQueue` implementation: Step 1 does not happen because the `SoftReferences` are still referenced through the map `ReferenceQueue.wrappers`. And so step 2 also will not happen, at least unless the VM runs out of memory, because there are still valid soft references for the byte arrays.

As a workaround, one could call `clear` on all the `SoftReferences` (provided that #2852 gets fixed). But this should normally not be necessary and one might want to avoid it if the list `buf` is relatively large.

A possible solution could be to subclass `java.lang.ref.SoftReference`, introducing a reference to the wrapper object. Then you could just cast the returned reference accordingly in `poll` and `remove` and there would be no need for the `wrappers` map any more. This might solve both #2854 and #2852.
(In r20341) Fixed #2852 and #2854.
Thanks for solving this so quickly. I will test it when it goes into the nightly build.

An automated test is a bit tricky because the garbage collector behaves somewhat unpredictable. However, here is a piece of code which reproduces the effect for me (while a corresponding Java version works well, as you would expect):
```scala
import scala.ref.{ReferenceQueue, SoftReference}
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
class RefQueueTest(arr: Array[Byte], queue: ReferenceQueue[Array[Byte]])
         extends SoftReference[Array[Byte]](arr, queue) {
   override protected def finalize() {
      RefQueueTest.finalizeCount += 1
   }
}
object RefQueueTest {
   var finalizeCount = 0
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val queue = new ReferenceQueue[Array[Byte]]
      val buf = new ArrayBuffer[RefQueueTest]
      for (i <- 0 until 100) {
         buf += new RefQueueTest(new Array[Byte](1024), queue)
      }
      buf.clear()
      System.gc()
      Thread.sleep(500)
      System.gc()

      // The test succeeds if finalizeCount is >0 at this point.
      System.out.println("finalize count: " + finalizeCount);
   }
}
```
With the current (unfixed) Scala version, the finalize count is always 0 at the end. In the Java version it always seems to be 100. This is of course not strictly guaranteed as the garbage collector might decide not the free the objects or run the finalizers yet. But with 100 objects and the `sleep` it appears to work quite reliably. The `sleep` seems to be necessary to give the finalizers some time to run.
