It is probable I introduced this in r18530 addressing scala/bug#2274, and either not noticing the by-name argument to spawn or not remembering that right now by-name and defaults don't properly mix.  I have no immediate plan here, too many balls in the air, but I'll revert that patch if neither I nor anyone else dreams something up.
