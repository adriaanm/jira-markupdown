scala> () match { case () => true; case _ => false }
<console>:8: warning: comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true
              () match { case () => true; case _ => false }

{code}

Couldn't find other examples that trigger the warning.
Why is that a useless warning? More importantly, why doesn't it complain about unreachable code, because that's what the warning implies? I guess because it doesn't know there's only one value of type Unit.  But if it can spot it for the type with two values, it can do it for the type with one value.

(Is "unreachable code" being a warning rather than an error now a short term virtpatmat thing? I think it was better as an error.)

You don't want to be warned when you write this?
{code}
if (() == ()) true else false
{code}
You must have some interesting use case in mind.  It's not exactly an "implementation detail" that the pattern matcher calls ==, it's the specification of what pattern matching is.  I certainly consider it a feature that it warns in this spot, and would consider it a bug if it did not. The unreachable code warning is born of exactly the same calculus: "this can't possibly be what you meant."

I want to be warned when I write {{() == ()}}, but only when I myself write it. Looking at my snipped of code, it looks like the compiler just gave me a fortune cookie about Unit comparison instead of the unreachable warning I deserved. :p
You yourself did write it.  You wrote () match { case () => .  There is no reason in the world to warn on () == () but not on that, or vice versa.  They are the same thing. (You deserved the unreachable warning-should-be-error as well.)

If you are saying the error message should be tailored to the original syntax, then I would say absolutely it should. But it sounds like you're saying not to warn at all, and the logic of that escapes me.

No, no, no, I didn't make it clear enough, sorry: the warning is useless only for the syntax in question, no doubt about its usefulness in the general sense.
It's easy to add support for partitioning () into all its glorious subtypes.
I just haven't done that because I couldn't imagine anyone matching on it.
