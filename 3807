Reopening: when @tailrec is used on a non-recursive method, the default error message is still used: "it contains a recursive call not in tail position".

From `TailCalls.scala`:
```scala
else if (!isRecursiveCall) {
  if (receiverIsSuper) failHere("it contains a recursive call targetting a supertype")
  else failHere(defaultReason)
}
```

I haven't done any scalac hacking, but I assume this is the spot where you'd want to say "method is non-recursive."
