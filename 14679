I'd like to see the following two methods be added to Option:

    def notEmptyAnd(f: A => Boolean) : Boolean    
    def isEmptyOr(f: A => Boolean) : Boolean

Basically I think this would markedly improve readability of some code. I currently have (this is a real piece of code):

  bt.chain.forall { bID => 
    ft.chain.find(_.isSameType(bID)) match {
      case None => true
      case Some(fID) => fID.partialID == bID.partialID
    }
  }

This could be simplified as: 

  bt.chain.forall { bID => 
    ft.chain.find(_.isSameType(bID)).isEmptyOr(_.partialID == bID.partialID)
  }

I believe that this offers much more clarity than the various alternatives
