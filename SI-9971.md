The following produces a stack-overflow:

```scala
object InitBug {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    object Foo {
      val bar = Foo()
    }
    case class Foo()
    
    Foo.bar
  }
}
```
dotty gives

```
java.lang.NullPointerException

The local object has lazy val semantics, so the example is the same as:
```scala
class C { def c: C = ??? }
lazy val c: C = c.c             // doesn't warn
```

but the bug is that `Foo()` is not rewritten to `new Foo()`. That optimization side-steps the issue.

I also missed the part where order of local companions matters. The "existing object" must come first textually. The spec says "if a companion object exists already," but it's not obvious to me if that phrase means, "before a companion was synthesized" or "textually before this case class definition was processed by the compiler." I think the former is surely preferable but the latter got voted into office.
