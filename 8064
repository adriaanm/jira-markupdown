I can confirm this with the REPL of version 2.11.0-M4.

I think it has something to do with some new history feature where e.g. !n is replaced by the n-th history command.

Here is short script to show it:

{quote}
michael@local:~$ rm .scala_history
michael@local:~$ echo "This is a bug" > .scala_history
michael@local:~$ scala
