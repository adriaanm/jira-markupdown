Hi,

The scala compiler crashes while parsing this, probably invalid, code regarding xml.
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r20062-b20091209020151 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val xml = <Test {None match { case Some(o) => opt1={o.toString} case None =>  }} />
```

The stack trace and console errors are attached.

Regards,
Germï¿½n.
