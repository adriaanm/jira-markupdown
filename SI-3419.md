This is in 2.8.0.RC2.

Given these two source files:

B.scala
```scala
trait T[A,B] {
        type X[a <: A, b <: B] <: B
}
```

C.scala
```scala
object F {
        type S = T[Any,Int] {
                type X[N <: Any, Acc <: Int] = Acc
        }
}
```

They compile fine when B.scala and C.scala are compiled together.  When C.scala is compiled separately after B.scala, there is this compiler error:
```scala
C.scala:3: error: The kind of type X does not conform to the expected kind of type X<: <?> in trait T.
                type X[N <: Any, Acc <: Int] = Acc
                     ^
one error found
```
spec ticket: #3512
(In r22754) closes #3419: test files

omit check that wouldn't work with separate compilation,
not needed anymore because compiler has become more robust

the actual fix was committed as part of r22512, see #3374

also see #3512
