Paul, I'm sorry if it wasn't clear from what I wrote that this issue has been re-discussed (that is including Martin). I thought mentioning that we discussed this in the core meeting was sufficient, as Martin usually attends.

More clearly: Martin was especially concerned with the fact that this makes boxing observable and thinks this (i.e. this ticket) needs to be fixed. He therefore proposed to lift the casts in unboxing from `asInstanceOf\[Int\]` to `asInstanceOf\[Number\]` (the OP's second proposed option) and see if something blows up.

[PR #3294](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3294) does this, nothing blows up, one additional `instanceof` is required. No feedback from Martin yet.
