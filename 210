I verified that the example gives a BoxedAnyArray for 2.6.1 RC1, RC2, and final, as well as for 2.6.0 final. Sean did some experimental changes to arrays in-between. He had to revert them because other things broke. See Ticket scala/bug#160. Most likely, the 
``correct_ behavior was observed when Sean's changes were in place. I am closing this one and make a note in scala/bug#160 that they are related.
