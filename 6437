(extempore in [r25454|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25454]) Disallowed implicit modifier on auxiliary constructors, since it either
silently accomplishes nothing or crashes the compiler.  If it should do
something useful let me know.  Closes SI-4882, review by odersky.
