Running following code produces java.lang.VerifyError. It fails with 2.8.0.RC6 and works with 2.7.7.

{code}
class Env
class Dep(arg: AnyRef)(implicit val env: Env)
class Component(implicit env: Env){
  def dep = new Dep(Inner()){}

  case class Inner()(implicit env: Env)
}

object ThisInConstructorProblem{
  def main(args: Array[String]){
    val foo = new Component()(new Env)
    foo.dep
  }
}
{code}

Note that the code works if the implicit env in class Dep is not val:

{code}
class Dep(arg: AnyRef)(implicit env: Env)
{code}

The code also works if the instantiated class is not inner class:

{code}
  def dep = new Dep(Inner())
{code}

It also works if the Inner class does not take the implicit parameter:
{code}
  case class Inner()
{code}


Adriaan, could you have a look? It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem, the implicit search wants to use the implicit value in $$anon, during it's construction, but the object is not yet constructed. It correctly uses Component.this.env for the super constructor call. If I explicitly add that one myself, the inner one is also corrected.

{code}
def dep: Dep = {
      final class $$anon extends Dep {
        def this(): anonymous class $$anon = {
          $$anon.super.this(Component.this.Inner.apply()($$anon.this.env))(Component.this.env);
          ()
        };
        <empty>
      };
      new $$anon()
    };
{code}
looks like another case of mistaken identity:

{code}

class Dep(meh: Int)(implicit val s: String)

object Test extends Application {
  implicit val s: String = "meh" // verify error
  //implicit val blahblah: String = "meh" // replace above line by this one --> no runtime error
  
  def Inner(implicit s: String) = 1

  new Dep(Inner){}
}
{code}
see also SI-2236, which resulted in the following epic lines in Implicits.scala

{code}
       val nextOuter = 
         if (owner.isConstructor) {
           if (outer.tree.isInstanceOf[Template]) outer.outer.outer
           else outer.outer.outer
         } else outer
{code}
here's my working hypothesis:

{code}
class Dep(x: Int)(implicit val nameClash: String)

object Test extends Application {
  implicit val nameClash: String = "meh"

  def meth(implicit w: String) = 1

  // when typing Meh's default constructor Meh.this.nameClash (inherited from Dep)
  // shadows Test.nameClash, thus, when inferring the argument `w` in the call to meth,
  // Test.nameClash is not eligible statically, Meh.this.nameClash is picked (which then causes the VerifyError)
  // BUG: Meth.this.nameClash should not be in (the implicit) scope during the super constructor call in the first place
  class Meh extends Dep(meth) 
  /*
    class Meh extends Dep {
      def this() {
        this(Test.this.meth(Meh.this.nameClash))(Test.this.nameClash)
      }
    }
  */
  
  new Meh
}
{code}

thus, when in a constructor of the class C, and moreover in a context that is enclosed by the self/super constructor call of that constructor,  the members of C are not in scope and the *outer* of the class C is the next outer (its implicits are also in scope here)

this leads to the following pearl:
{code}
val nextOuter = if (owner.isConstructor) (if(enclInSelfSuperCall) outer.outer.outer.outer else outer.outer.outer) else outer
{code}

since the only decent numbers are 0 and 1, I propose we encapsulate `outer.outer.outer` into something more descriptive -- but what?
slightly shinier pearl:

{code}
      // nextOuter determines which context is searched next for implicits (after `this`, which contributes `newImplicits` below)
      // in most cases, it is simply the outer context
      // if we're owned by a constructor, the actual current context and the conceptual context are different when it comes to scoping:
      // the current conceptual scope is the context enclosing the blocks that represent the constructor body
      // (TODO: why is there more than one such block in the outer chain?)
      val scopingCtx =
        if(owner.isConstructor) nextEnclosing(c => !c.tree.isInstanceOf[Block]) // drop the constructor body blocks
        else this
      val nextOuter = scopingCtx.outer
{code}
(In r24093) closes SI-3619, SI-4141. need to exclude implicits from class C in calls to superconstructor from C's constructor.
replaced the epic outer.outer.outer by something more robust that goes to the context corresponding to the enclosing class

nextOuter determines which context is searched next for implicits (after `this`, which contributes `newImplicits` below)
in most cases, it is simply the outer context
if we're owned by a constructor, the actual current context and the conceptual context are different when it comes to scoping:
the current conceptual scope is the context enclosing the blocks that represent the constructor body
(TODO: why is there more than one such block in the outer chain?)
