Here's a compiler crasher reported on the Specs2 mailing list. I did not rule out the possibility of a dependency problem on specs2 RC2 artifact.

{code:title=build.sbt}
scalaVersion := "2.10.0-RC2"

libraryDependencies += "org.specs2" % "specs2_2.10.0-RC2" % "1.12.2"

resolvers += "specs2-resolver-0" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"
{code}

{code:title=src/test/scala/ResourceSpec.scala}

import java.io.Closeable
import org.specs2.mock.Mockito
import org.specs2.mutable.Specification

class ResourceSpec extends Specification with Mockito {

  "a" should {
    "b" in {        
      val mockResource = mock[Closeable]
    }
  }
}
{code}

When one executes sbt test, it results in:

{code}

{code}

The cause of the problem is a missing JAR on the classpath.

If you move the {{mock}} call to the top level, you get a more accurate error message.

{noformat}
info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /Users/jason/code/scratch1/target/scala-2.10/classes...
[error] bad symbolic reference to class MockSettings in package mockito (a classfile may be missing)
[error] one error found
{noformat}

After adding the following:

{code}
libraryDependencies += "org.mockito" % "mockito-all" % "1.9.0"
{code}

Both the reduced and originally reported files compile successfully.

But no doubt we should issue this error in both cases. It will be interesting to piece together the circumstances that lead do that assertion error during unpickling.

Andrew: It appears that the references from Scala Swing to {{scala.actor}} are really some historical hangover. I've created a ticket to either remove them or fix it's POM to declare a dependency.

Are you by any chance referring to {{scala.swing.SwingWorker}} in your code? I'd like to figure out specifically which class you're referring to that brings in this dependency.
Jason, no, I don't use scala.swing.SwingWorker, but I have own internal wrapper around javax.swing.SwingWorker:
{code}
import javax.swing.SwingWorker
import scala.swing._
...

protected class SwiWorker[T](parent : Component, msg : String, job : => Answer[T], showPost : Boolean, 
                  postMsg : String, postJob : Answer[T] => Unit) extends SwingWorker[Answer[T],AnyRef] {
   ...
}
{code}
Probably this import list is dangerous at some point: scala.swing package contains SwingWorker also.
when running under -Ydebug, I think this may be relevant:

{code}
[warn] creating stub symbol for value stubbing in package mockito (a classfile may be missing)
{code}

the assertion 
{code}
java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: value stubbing
	at scala.reflect.internal.Types$ThisType.<init>(Types.scala:1388)
{code}

fails because we created a StubSymbol hoping that we could keep going a bit longer
except we shouldn't have
@Andrew:

Indeed, scala-swing's dependency on scala-actors is an historical accident. I've raised SI-6441 to remedy this.

Rather than depending on that actors JAR, you could change your code from:

{code}
import scala.swing._
import javax.swing.SwingWorker

abstract class SwiWorker[T] extends SwingWorker[T,AnyRef] 
{code}

To:

{code}
import scala.swing._

abstract class SwiWorker[T] extends javax.swing.SwingWorker[T,AnyRef] 
{code}

This will stop the compiler from searching for `SwingWorker` under the wildcard import `scala.swing._`.

This would also work:

{code}
import scala.swing.{SwingWorker => _, _}
import javax.swing.SwingWorker

abstract class SwiWorker[T] extends SwingWorker[T,AnyRef] 
{code}
