Sorry, this is a limitation of the interpreter. {{{ val half = if (x) y }}} is a valid statement all by itself, so when you press enter it is processed.  Avoiding this would require forcing everyone to press enter twice all the time, which is no good.

You can do this:
```scala
val half = (
    if (n % 2 == 0)
        n / 2
    else
        throw new RuntimeException("n must be even")
)
```
