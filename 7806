Huh.  That one diversifies the situation.  Notice that yours creates a label for "while$11", now that's an interestingly wrong appearing mangle.

[log icode] Added (method while$11,method while$11) to labels.

Why is the label parameter owned by NoSymbol I guess? "def x" renamed to "def quux" for clarity:
```
  Local(value x1,REF(class Null),arg=false) with s/e/r (0,0,) in method quux->class A->package <empty>
  Local(value x,REF(class BoxedUnit),arg=false) with s/e/r (0,0,) in 
  Local(variable exc1,REF(class Throwable),arg=false) with s/e/r (0,0,) in method quux->class A->package <empty>
```
