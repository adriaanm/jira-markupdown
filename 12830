From [http://www.nabble.com/Sbaz-Scala-update-tf4448802.html#a12693431 scala-lounge]

sbaz doesn't work and I do not see how to make it work.
I've downloaded  2.6.0 and it looks like there is newer sbaz version on the site so I run sbaz upgrade and get:
{code}
 P:\PRG\scala-2.6.0-final\bin>sbaz upgrade
 Refreshing list of available packages...
 Planning to install sbaz/1.22...
 Installing...
 java.io.IOException: could not delete P:\PRG\SCALA-~1.0-F\bin\..\misc\sbaz\scala- library.jar
{code}
The same error was with version 2.5.1
I could not find anything about this issue on web.
I run sbaz on Windows XP and my login has Administrator rights.
