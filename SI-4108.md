=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
1. Open [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections-impl_3.html Integrating new collections].

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The RNA bases used in the example should be adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U). See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA RNA].

=== What do you see instead? ===
Throughout the document, bases adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and uracil (U) are used. Note that it is missing cytosine (C) and has extra thymine (T). In a DNA sequence, uracil (U) gets replaced by thymine (T), so the above does not make sense.
