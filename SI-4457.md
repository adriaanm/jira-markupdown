Sorry for the "far from minimal" initial reproduction case, here is a cleaner one.
The compiler says that conv3 and conv4 are applicable to resolve the actual param of bFunc.
My first interrogation is why conv3 is considered as applicable.
To further convince myself that conv3 is not applicable, if I commented out conv4,
then the compiler finds no applicable conversions at all, not even conv3 that 
was considered a candidate implicit conv.

Another thing that I can't explain that commenting out conv5 makes the compiler happy

```scala
object ImplicitConvAmbiguity {

  class N[T]
  class NE[T] extends N[T]
  class NN[T] extends N[T]
  class AA[A1,A2]
  class BB[A]    

  implicit def conv1(i: Option[Float]) = new NE[Option[Float]]
  implicit def conv2(i: Int) = new NE[Int]
  implicit def conv3(op: AA[Byte,Byte]) = new N[Byte]
  implicit def conv4(op: AA[Float,Int]) = new N[Float]
  implicit def conv5(e: BB[java.util.Date]) = new NN[java.util.Date]

  
  def aFunc[A,B](a: NE[Option[A]], b: NE[B]) = new AA[A,B]

  def aFunc[A](a: NN[Option[A]], b: NN[A]) = new BB[A]

  def bFunc[T1](e1: N[T1]) = {}
  
  //bFunc(aFunc(conv1(Some(4F)), conv2(0)))
  
  bFunc(aFunc(Some(4F), 0))
}

```
I've basically been able to reproduce your remarks but maybe the additional comments will save time. 

Let's start with the last expression. It's where implicits should be applied: 

```scala
  /* for programs that typecheck, the arguments to the aFunc call below are always expanded like this: 
   *
   *    X.this.aFunc[Float, Int](  
   *                                X.this.conv1(scala.Some.apply[Float](4.0)), 
   *                                X.this.conv2(0)
   *                            ) 
   *
   * attempts to convert the result of aFunc's call lead to ambiguity 
   * if all of conv3, conv5, and the aFunc overload taking NN's (line 24) are uncommented.
   *
   */

  bFunc( 
         aFunc( 
                  Some(4F)   , /* after conversion: NE[Option[Float]] */
                  0            /* after conversion: NE[Int]           */
              ) 
       ) 
```

As the comment suggests, I see a problem when some members are in scope (conv3, conv5, and the 2nd aFunc overload). However, that's not sufficient for the error: they may be in scope but all goes well if just the conversions to aFunc's call are applied manually: 

```scala
  bFunc( 
         aFunc( 
                  new NE[Option[Float]]    , 
                  new NE[Int]             
              ) 
       )
```

Anyway, the example is about what happens if conv1 and conv2 convert from `Some(4F)` and `0`. 


Although uncommenting all three members below leads to ambiguity, that's also strange because the aFunc overload that takes NN's shouldn't be picked anyway: 

```scala
  /* Uncommenting all three of the members below causes ambiguity among conversion of aFunc's result */

  // conv3 is a candidate to convert the result of the aFunc overload above into bFunc's argument 
  implicit def conv3(op: AA[Byte,Byte]     ) = new N[Byte] 
  implicit def conv5(e : BB[java.util.Date]) = new NN[java.util.Date]

  def aFunc[A]  (a: NN[Option[A]], b: NN[A]) = new BB[A] 
  // the aFunc overload above is never picked because 
  //    conv1, conv2 return NE's not NN's 
  // and 
  //    there are no other conversions into NN's from the args to aFunc's call below. 
```

I also tried with `-Xlog-implicits` but that didn't make me any wiser.

The example in full, with comments: 

```scala
object X { // http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/4457

  class N[T]
  class NE[T] extends N[T]
  class NN[T] extends N[T]
  class AA[A1,A2]
  class BB[A]    

  // conv1 and conv2 just convert the arguments to the aFunc invocation below 
  implicit def conv1(i: Option[Float]) = new NE[Option[Float]]
  implicit def conv2(i: Int)           = new NE[Int]

  // just here to convert the result of aFunc invocation below 
  implicit def conv4(op: AA[Float,Int]) = new N[Float]

  def aFunc[A,B](a: NE[Option[A]], b: NE[B]) = new AA[A,B]

  /* Uncommenting all three of the members below causes ambiguity among conversion of aFunc's result */

  // conv3 is a candidate to convert the result of the aFunc overload above into bFunc's argument 
  implicit def conv3(op: AA[Byte,Byte]     ) = new N[Byte] 
  implicit def conv5(e : BB[java.util.Date]) = new NN[java.util.Date]

  def aFunc[A]  (a: NN[Option[A]], b: NN[A]) = new BB[A] 
  // the aFunc overload above is never picked because 
  //    conv1, conv2 return NE's not NN's 
  // and 
  //    there are no other conversions into NN's from the args to aFunc's call below. 
  // HOWEVER uncommenting it (together with conv3 and conv5) leads to ambiguity 

  def bFunc[T1](e1: N[T1]) = {}
  
  /* for programs that typecheck, the arguments to the aFunc call below are always expanded like this: 
   *
   *    X.this.aFunc[Float, Int](  
   *                                X.this.conv1(scala.Some.apply[Float](4.0)), 
   *                                X.this.conv2(0)
   *                            ) 
   *
   * attempts to convert the result of aFunc's call lead to ambiguity 
   * if all of conv3, conv5, and the aFunc overload (line 24) are uncommented.
   *
   */

  bFunc( 
         aFunc( 
                  Some(4F)    , /* after conversion: new NE[Option[Float]] */
                  0             /* after conversion: new NE[Int]           */
              ) 
       ) 
  
}
```

Here's a further simplification.

What surprises me the most is that the compiler considers the return type of an invalid choice (overload) of **aFunc** overload in it's search for implicitly converting it's result.


```scala
object ImplicitConvAmbiguity2 {

  class N[T]
  class NE[T] extends N[T]
  class NN[T] extends N[T]
  class AA[A]
  class BB[A]

  implicit def conv1(i: Float) = new NE[Float]
  implicit def conv3(op: AA[java.util.TooManyListenersException]) = new N[java.util.TooManyListenersException]
  implicit def conv4(op: AA[Float]) = new N[Float]
  implicit def conv5(e: BB[java.util.GregorianCalendar]) = new N[java.util.GregorianCalendar]

  def aFunc[A](a: NE[A]) = new AA[A]

  def aFunc[A](a: NN[A]) = new BB[A]

  def bFunc[T](e1: N[T]) = {}

  bFunc(aFunc(4F))
}
```

Are you sure you included the list? I have hunted and I can't find it.  I expected the result, but I would like to hear any additional detail.

I think this issue has some life in it yet, so let me note for the record:

This example went from working to not working in r23244, which it was stated was to fix #3281 and #3866.  This may help to illuminate why propagating accumulated constraints too far can be as much of a problem as not far enough.
Hi, I'm pretty happy that the issue has been reopened, I'm wondering if the language specs regarding implicit resolution has been reinterpreted. Initially the reproduction
case was judged to be coherent with the language spec, so Hubert, when you say you have
a fix, do you interpret the language specs differently ?

For libraries, requiring the user code to have type annotations reduces it's value,
so I want to code it in a way that type inference is used to reduce unnecessary verbosity. I was asking so I can know what I can rely on.
(In r24846) Closes #4457. Review by odersky
