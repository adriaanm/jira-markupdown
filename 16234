scala.util.matching.regex.replaceAllIn(String, (Match) => String) seems to escape backslashes in the string to be operated on. The attached example shows how scala.util.matching.regex.replaceAllIn(String, (Match) => String) has different behavior compared to scala.util.matching.regex.replaceAllIn(String, String). In my environment I get the following output:

c:\projects\j2s\Java2Scala>scala RegexTest
rs = 'public foo \"gh\\dooh\"'
r1 = '\"gh\\dooh\"'
r2 = '"gh\dooh"'

But I would have expected r1 and r2 to be identical.
