Side issue noticed in SI-8367, the error message related to a synthetic super call is positioned confusingly at a comment.

{code}
class C



// comment
{code}

Positioned as:
{code}
[[syntax trees at end of                    parser]] // newSource1.scala
[6]package [6]<empty> {
  [6]class C extends [7][21]scala.AnyRef {
    [21]def <init>() = [21]{
      [NoPosition][NoPosition][NoPosition]super.<init>();
      [21]()
    }
  }
}
{code}

This led me to try this patch: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3612

But there is a bit more work needed to finesse this (as always with positions), so I'm lodging this as a ticket for now.
