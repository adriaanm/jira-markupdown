Take the disassembly of `scala.collection.mutable.StringBuilder.getLength` as an example:

{code}
public void setLength(int);
 Code:
  0:   iload_1
  1:   iconst_0
  2:   if_icmplt       9
  5:   iconst_1
  6:   goto    10
  9:   iconst_0
  10:  new     SI-478; //class
scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder$$$$anonfun$$setLength$$1
  13:  dup
  14:  pop
  15:  aload_0
  16:  iload_1
  17:  invokespecial   SI-481; //Method
scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder$$$$anonfun$$setLength$$1."<init>":(Lscala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder;I)V
...
{code}

The `new` ~ `dup` ~ `pop` ~ ... ~ `invokespecial` sequence is a hint that something's going wrong, because after `invokespecial` the newly created instance can't be accessed at all.

The closure class (and its instantiation) isn't needed any more because it was completely inlined into the method in question.
