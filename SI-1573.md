Given the following example:

{code}
trait test {
  @transient lazy val traitval: String = ""
}

class testimpl extends test {
  @transient lazy val classval: String = ""
}
{code}

This leads to the following fields in the testimpl.class:

{code}
  private final String traitval;
  private transient String classval;
{code}

But traitval should also be transient, right?

(scala 2.7.2)

(In r23435) Added separate bitmaps for private and transient lazy vals. Closes SI-3038, SI-1573. Review by dragos.
I had to fix a couple of initialization issues that checkinit forced me to do and that weren't a problem before because the bitmap was serialized even for @transitive. For that I needed to change the setters in checkinit so that they also update the bitmap.
This was actually fixed already. It fixes SI-1574 not SI-1573.
