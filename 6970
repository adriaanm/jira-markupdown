As you have clearly discovered, specialization leaks like a sieve as soon as you get away from simple, non-compositional uses.  I wish I could propose a realistic form of assistance you could provide, but unless you're interested in learning the compiler well enough to tackle the implementation (and it's not exactly the easiest part of the compiler) then for the moment we're both waiting for a white knight: although I would love to work on specialization, it's of necessity way down on my list of priorities.
