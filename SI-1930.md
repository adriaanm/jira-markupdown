Complete stacktrace is in file joined.

Is it possible to have a clearer message when this type of exception happens ?
You should enclose an example that triggers this error, as self-contained and trimmed down as possible,  in order to allow us to diagnose the problem. In this case, this ticket looks like a duplicate of #1896.
"Is it possible to have a clearer message when this type of exception happens ?"

I'll trade you a clearer error message for at least a hint at what code induced it.  Stack traces aren't much help by themselves.

I would be very surprised if this was not a duplicate of #1896 which is fixed in r17719.
