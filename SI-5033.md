this should compile, instead we get `error: overriding method extract in trait PipExtractor of type (f: Fruit)f.Seed;
 method extract has incompatible type`

{code}
trait Fruit {
  type Seed
}

trait PipExtractor {
  def extract(f: Fruit): f.Seed
}

trait LaserGuidedPipExtractor extends PipExtractor {
  def extract(f: Fruit): f.Seed
}
{code}
(moors in [r25860|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25860]) 5033: align bound syms when comparing method types

can't believe I missed that one...

closes SI-5033

more complete test case to make sure the multi-arglist case works as well

no review
