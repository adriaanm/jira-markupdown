Is this a problem? I only see it eliding the cast when nothing ever uses the value after being cast. In this code the first one disappears in erasure, but not the second.
{code}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    fakefakefake().asInstanceOf[String]
    fakefakefake().asInstanceOf[String].length
  }
  def fakefakefake(): Object = new Object
}
{code}
