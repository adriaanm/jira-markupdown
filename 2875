Isn't it possible to have a priority system that makes int2Integer be preferred to expanding int to long and then calling long2Long?

Roughly, it would work by imagining a graph where each "conversion step" is represented by an edge, and the compiler would pick the shortest path to something valid (in this case, ("call int2Int",) is length 1, while ("weak-conform int to long", "call long2Long") is length 2).

I believe that C++ has a similar mechanism for implicit conversions, which could be a source of inspiration.
