I would like to be able to write this:

  for{x = foo(bar); y <- x} ...

the language spec (6.19) says "An enumerator sequence always starts with 
a generator", but why? From time to time I would find it convenient to put
a value definition first.  I realize that in the above code I only use x once,
but I've hit this in real code where I want to use x more than once.

(Perhaps "if" should be allowed too?)

Is there any reason this couldn't be implemented as a parser rewrite to move the value definition out of the for?

e.g. rewrite Seth's original example as

```scala
val x = foo(bar)
for {y <- x}
```
