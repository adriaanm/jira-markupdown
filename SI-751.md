collection.immutable.Map.filterKeys should return collection.immutable.Map

Now it returns collection.Map.Projection. So

{code}

var map = Map[Int, Int] = ...
map = map.filterKeys(...)
{code}

is not possible.

(Map is Predef.Map == immutable.Map)
I think it's better to leave it as a view for the moment. If you want the same kind of map, use filter. Once (if?) we have systematic views for maps we can deprecate it.



Seems to work now:

{code}
scala> var map = Map(1 -> "a", 2 -> "b", 3 -> "c")
map: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,java.lang.String] = Map((1,a), (2,b), (3,c))

scala> map = map.filterKeys(_ % 2 == 0)
map: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,java.lang.String] = Map(2 -> b)
{code}
