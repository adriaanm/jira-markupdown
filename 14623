```scala
  ~> ./scala/dists/latest/bin/scala -unchecked
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r19127-b20091018090027 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).

scala> Array(1).isInstanceOf[Array[_]]
<console>:5: warning: abstract type _$$1 in type is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
       Array(1).isInstanceOf[Array[_]]
                            ^
res0: Boolean = true
```

I fail to see how this warning can be correct. I didn't specify a type to be erased.
and this works with no warning:
```scala
scala> List(1).isInstanceOf[List[_]]
res1: Boolean = true
```
