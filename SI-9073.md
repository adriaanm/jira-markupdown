See https://github.com/scala/scala/issues/4237
Sure.

Currenlty, scala.util.Try
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/util/Try.scala

is tied to scala.util.control.NonFatal
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/util/control/NonFatal.scala

with hard coded exception list
case _: VirtualMachineError | *: ThreadDeath | *: InterruptedException | *: LinkageError | *: ControlThrowable =>

Hence feature request:
1) there are use cases when this list needs be customizable
2) there are multiple ways to make it customizable
3) customization should have no impact on performance

Recent use case example:
an attempt to integrate Sigar library loader https://github.com/kamon-io/sigar-loader
with Akka https://github.com/akka/akka and Kamon https://github.com/kamon-io/Kamon

scala.util.Try could not be used due to current limitation
in kamon we ended up with lots of ordinary try/catch, in akka with scala.util.Try copy/paste customization
https://github.com/carrot-garden/scala_akka/blob/cluster-metrics-module/akka-cluster-metrics/src/main/scala/akka/cluster/metrics/Provision.scala#L94

/**
 * A copy of [[scala.util.Try]] with the [[scala.util.control.NonFatal]] logic removed.
 *
 * Required for collector provisioning, since collectors may depend
 * on native library discovery which may be missing at the run time.
 *
 * That would result in exceptions such as [[java.lang.LinkageError]]
 * which are non-fatal for metrics extension use case.
 *
 * Please lobby the scala-library team to make [[scala.util.Try]] more customizable.
 */

One way to make scala.util.Try/scala.util.control.NonFatal customizable is
to add NonFatal trait and implicit constructor Try(implicit errorType: NonFatal = NonFatal)
with current NonFatal as default implementation for compatibility.



When you use `flatMap`, `flatten`, and the like, whose `NonFatal` is chosen for the result?  Or is it okay to not know?
There is improved doc for `util.control.Exception`.

Is this the use case?
```scala
scala> import util._,control._,Exception._
import util._
import control._
import Exception._

scala> Try(throw new LinkageError)
java.lang.LinkageError
  at .$line9$$read$$$anonfun$1(<console>:21)
  at scala.util.Try$.apply(Try.scala:210)
  ... 27 elided

scala> catching(classOf[LinkageError]) withTry { throw new LinkageError; "" }
res1: scala.util.Try[String] = Failure(java.lang.LinkageError)

scala> Try(throw new ControlThrowable{})
$anon$1

scala> throw new ControlThrowable{}
$anon$1

scala> catchingPromiscuously(classOf[ControlThrowable]) withTry { throw new ControlThrowable{} }
res4: scala.util.Try[Nothing] = Failure($anon$1)

scala> catching(classOf[ControlThrowable]) withTry { throw new ControlThrowable{} }
$anon$1

```
