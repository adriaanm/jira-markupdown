=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
  object Ord extends Ordering[Int] {
    def compare(x: Int, y: Int) = y.compare(x)
  }
  val pq = new PriorityQueue[Int]()(Ord)
  pq += (1, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  pq.min  // Output 1
  pq.max  // Output 1
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Method 'min' should return result meets the order of the queue. But it takes implicit argument from TravesableOnce. 


=== What do you see instead? ===

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1 final
  - Java: 1.6.0_12
  - Operating system: Windows 7

Oh, thanks. Simply confusing the returned result and seem is not logical.

Sorry, in what way is this different than SI-4405? IMHO, {{min}} and {{max}} shouldn't have been overloaded to return the first and last element of an ordered collection.
