The second example is now also fixed (in r14136).

> Why should Clss[T forSome {type T}] be legal while (Clss[T] forSome {type T}) is not? 

Because the first is a class type and the second is an existential type.
The spec restricts parent types to be class types. I don't have the time to work out all the ramifications of allowing existentials in parent types. I suspect there will be quite a few subtle ones. That's why I keep to the spec and disallow it. If someone (you?) wants to start research on FS with existentials (and universals?) in parents, that would be very interesting. But that would be for the long term.
