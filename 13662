I am having some problems getting past go with calling a .jar+.dll JNI API from Scala.

I have rhapsody.jar and rhapsody.dll installed in the following location:
c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/

I compile x.scala with the command line:
scalac -classpath .;c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/rhapsody.jar ria05.scala

I run gen05.class with the command line:
scala -classpath .;c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/rhapsody.jar -Djava.library.path=c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/ gen05

I get the error:
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no rhapsody in java.library.path
(... etc)

I then copy rhapsody.dll into my Scala project directory and run the same command line:
scala -classpath .;c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/rhapsody.jar -Djava.library.path=c:/telelogic/rhapsody7.3/share/javaapi/ gen05

... and the native method is invoked as expected.

My conclusion is that scala erroneously ignores the -Djava.library.path option.
