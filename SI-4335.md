=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===

The attribute sets of two nodes are not compared correctly for equality - only the last attribute is used.

Incorrect result:
```scala
scala> <score color="A" value="0"/> == <score color="B" value="0" />
res1: Boolean = true
```

The bug doesn't appear if the different attribute is the last:
```scala
scala> <score value="0" color="A"/> == <score value="0" color="B"/>
res0: Boolean = false
```

Given that attributes are stored in a ad-hoc linked list, the behavior can be traced to `Attribute.strict_==` forgetting to compare the rest of the list (i.e. the `next` member) in the below source:
https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_8_1_final/src//library/scala/xml/Attribute.scala#L72

`UnprefixedAttribute` doesn't override the method, and it is the class actually during execution of the above code to represent the requested attribute.
