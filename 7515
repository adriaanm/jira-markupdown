Thanks for reporting it James! There's a bug in the java file parser, described in scala/bug#5699. 
Whenever you give scalac or scaladoc a Java file, it parses it and the resulting tree is used in the compiler. Unfortunately the tree is incorrect and this blows up scaladoc.

For the time being, can you compile the java class and put in the classpath?
