The compiler should flag the following expression with another error message.
```scala
scala> val a@(b:Int) = a
<console>:11: error: recursive value x$1 needs type
       val a@(b:Int) = a
           ^
```
As far as I know, it is not possible to assign a type to the pattern variable `a` in a pattern binder `a @ <pat>`. 

A better message would be "recursive value a needs type" or "recursive definition of pattern variable not possible".
