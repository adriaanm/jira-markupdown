I'm not sure how the first one is being parsed to make this come back true, but it seems safe that it should be -0.0f or at worst a parse error, and not silently end up as 0.0f.
{code}
scala> import java.lang.Float                   
import java.lang.Float

scala> new Float(0.0f) equals new Float(-0.0f)  
res0: Boolean = true

scala> new Float(0.0f) equals new Float(-(0.0f))
res1: Boolean = false
{code}
I think again there's nothing we can do. Here are three facts.

1. In order to make structural types work, Scala's boxed types are the same as Java's. So scala.Float gets transparently boxed to java.lang.Float.

2. We have decided against simple overloading for equality, because the result of equality might then be different under automatic boxing.

3. == on scala.Float should follow the IEEE standard, which means 0f == -0f.

Ergo, for == on java.lang.Float the same definition of equality has to hold. If you are not happy with that, you need to drop one of the three assumptions above. 

So for me it's a wontfix.



I created SI-3657 to document the overall issue.
(In r23024) Restoring negative literal parsing behavior to what should be
the least surprising option.  Thanks much to Johannes Rudolph for
identifying the bug in the bytecode generator which needed addressing
for us to arrive at proper -0.0 behavior, and for writing the majority
of this patch.

A '-' followed immediately by either a number or a period should
now always be treated as a single numeric literal, which means the
minus binds more tightly than anything else.  A specific example
of how this differs from 2.8 final is:

  -5.+(10) == 5.0   // and not -15.0

The full range of potentially ambiguous parses involving prefix
operators, numbers, and dots is quite large and still needs to be
completely and clearly specified.

Closes SI-2378 and SI-3657, review by odersky, jrudolph.
