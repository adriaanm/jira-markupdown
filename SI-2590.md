This bug might be compiler and not Eclipse related.

*Steps to reproduce the bug*

 1. Create a class _A_ in a file _A.scala_ that references an non-existing class B. For example {{ class A(b: B) }} Since _B_ is undefined we get a compilation error as expected.
 2. Create the class _B_ in a file _B.scala_ and save the new file to compile it. For example: {{ class B }}

Now we expect the compiler to also compile the class _A_ and to resolve the compilation error introduced in the 1st step but nothing happens and the error remains. To resolve the error we either have to edit and save the _A.scala_ file or to do a clean & build for the project.

In the later case (clean & build) the error disappears from the Problems View but the error marker remains in the Scala editor and to remove it we have to edit and save the file.

Please note that deleting code (methods) from a class in another file works as expected (also see SI-2581).

This bug might be related to SI-2581 and SI-2582.

Tested with Eclipse 3.5.1 and SDT 2.8.0.r19410-b20091106040253.
That's interesting.  I saw similar behavior using !BuildManagerTest (a way to test the new build manager), but didn't know if it was a problem in practice.  The issue I saw could be reproduced as follows.  Given two sources A.scala, B.scala:

{code}
object A {
 def y = B.x
}
object B {
 def x = 3
}
{code}

 1. delete {{def x = 3}}
 1. should see a compile error because A.scala still references it
 1. add {{def x = 3}} back
 1. A.scala isn't recompiled in !BuildManagerTest, so it might be that the error marker is still there.  

Note that I don't know if this is an issue with the build manager or if it should be handled by build clients, since a file that hasn't successfully compiled should be included in the sources to recompile until it succeeds.

IMHO incremental compilation is an extremely important feature for Scala since the compiler is slow (at least slower the javac that most new Scala users used to use).

Can someone please check if bug SI-2581 is also related to BuildManager and not to Eclipse?
