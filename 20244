Scala options are a pain to use in java, but they would be much more pleasant if you could orNull them.  As it is today, they blow up with things like:
```scala
error] class AllOf implements RoutePredicate {
                       [error] blahblaaablhablah.java:24: method orNull in class scala.Option<A> cannot be applied to given types;
                       [error]   required: scala.Predef.$less$colon$less<scala.runtime.Null$,A1>
                       [error]   found: no arguments
                       [error]   reason: cannot infer type-variable(s) A1
                       [error]     (actual and formal argument lists differ in length)
                       [error]     String sanitizedPath = opt.orNull();
                       [error] Compile failed at Oct 24, 2016 1:38:55 PM [0.221s]

               compile(blabhlahblahblahbl/predicates:predicates) failed: Zinc compile failed.
```
