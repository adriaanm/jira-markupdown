it would be nice if we could define function arguments with pattern matching. 

e.g. 
```scala
case class Foo(x : Int, y : Int);

def bar (Foo(x, y) : Foo) = x + y;
```

Currently we have to either do:
```scala
  def bar(foo : Foo) = foo.x + foo.y
```

Or
```scala
  def bar(foo : Foo) = { val Foo(x, y) = foo; x + y }
```

The latter is acceptable but tedious. The former becomes a right pain pretty quickly. It would be nice to be able to circumvent this problem altogether - particularly in the case of tuples.
