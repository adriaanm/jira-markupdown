it would be nice if we could define function arguments with pattern matching. 

e.g. 

{code}
case class Foo(x : Int, y : Int);

def bar (Foo(x, y) : Foo) = x + y;
{code}

Currently we have to either do:

{code}
  def bar(foo : Foo) = foo.x + foo.y
{code}

Or


{code}
  def bar(foo : Foo) = { val Foo(x, y) = foo; x + y }
{code}

The latter is acceptable but tedious. The former becomes a right pain pretty quickly. It would be nice to be able to circumvent this problem altogether - particularly in the case of tuples.
