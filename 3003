Yes, reading the spec (which I admit I hadn't), it clearly states "The final modifier must be present and no type annotation may be given".

But, to the average developer:
```scala
val a = "hi"
```
and
```scala
val a: String = "hi"
```
are the same thing, everything else is unexpected and comes as a surprise.
