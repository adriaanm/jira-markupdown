=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
scala> var n: Nothing = _
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at .<init>(<console>:14)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at $$export(<console>)
	at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)

	at scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.Line$$$$anonfun$$1.apply$$mcV$$sp(Line.scala:43)
	at scala.tools.nsc.io.package$$$$anon$$2.run(package.scala:12)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:636)
```

It works for other reference/value types (0/0.0/null ...).

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Usually I don't expect that assignments throw an Exception at runtime.

It should either create a compiler error (if nothing useful can be done) or succeed (although I can't think what "succeed" could mean in this context).

=== What do you see instead? ===
A NullPointerException.


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1/2.9 trunk
Scala Language Spec ï¿½4.2:

```scala
A variable definition var x : T = _ can appear only as a member of a template. It
introduces a mutable field with type T and a default initial value. The default value
depends on the type T as follows:

   0         if T is Int or one of its subrange types,
   0L        if T is Long,
   0.0f      if T is Float,
   0.0d      if T is Double,
   false     if T is Boolean,
   {}        if T is Unit,
   null      for all other types T.
```

The spec agrees with the occurring behaviour, but it seems inconsistent because Nothing might be considered an uninhabited type and 
```scala
var n: Nothing = null
```
is also refused and
```scala
var n: Nothing = _
```
behaves more like
```scala
var n: Nothing = throw new NullPointerException
```

Maybe it would make sense to add a line to explain what happens with Nothing?
Actually, this does not throw an exception per se. Only when the field is actually accessed does it throw an exception:

```scala
scala> class A[T] {
     |   var elem: T = _
     | }            
defined class A                                                                                                            
scala> new A        
res0: A[Nothing] = A@391b0c           
                
scala> (new A).elem
java.lang.NullPointerException

scala> class B {
     |   var elem: Nothing = _
     | }
defined class B

scala> new B
res2: B = B@e79eb3
```

In the repl, the field is accessed in order to be written, that's why an exception occurs. Perhaps the spec should say what happens when accessing such a value (which particular exception is thrown).
