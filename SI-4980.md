In the Scala Language Specification (the version dated May 24 2011), in section 12.1 "Root Classes", the paragraph explaining how isInstanceOf works when given a type that is a type member of some outer class ends with the following half-sentence: "In other words, an isInstanceOf test does not check for the"

Then it breaks off, and the next paragraph begins. What does an isInstanceOf test not check for? I'd like to find out, because this is a fairly subtle point of the language and I actually can't tell what the rest of the sentence was intended to say. =)

An isInstanceOf test does not check that types have the same enclosing instance.  Here is what it is saying.

{code}
class A { 
  class B
  def f(x: Any) = x.isInstanceOf[B]
  def g(x: Any) = x match { case _: B => true ; case _ => false }
}
val a1 = new A
val a2 = new A
val b2 = new a2.B

scala> a1.f(b2)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> a1.g(b2)
res1: Boolean = false
{code}

Cool, thanks for the explanation.

Are you able to update the specification to reflect that? (At least for the next version, if you're real conservative about changes.) I'm not sure where the source lives or where the copy on the website (http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf) comes from.
