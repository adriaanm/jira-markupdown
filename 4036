I've chosen the path of enforcing as many restrictions via type system as possible. !NotNull is just one of measures. Unfortunately, it's not as powerful as it could be:
```scala
def f(s: String with NotNull) {}
val s = "Hello" // String, but could be String with NotNull
f(s)            // compiler error
```

Does "won't appear soon" mean that 2.8.0.Final may leave this unfixed? If fix is planned for 2.8.0, then I'd prefer to wait and use on RC1 for now.
