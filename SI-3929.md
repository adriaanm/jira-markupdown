It's perfectly valid in Swing to set either of the components of a JSplitPane to be null, it collapses that side down.  But SplitPane appears to assume that there must be a component on either side.

The following line exhibits this behaviour:
new SplitPane {leftComponent = null; rightComponent = new Button}

It can be avoided on construction by excluding the leftComponent clause, but if it is set later then the same issue occurs:
java.lang.NullPointerException
	at scala.swing.SplitPane.topComponent_$$eq(SplitPane.scala:37)
	at scala.swing.SplitPane.leftComponent_$$eq(SplitPane.scala:43)
        ....

Tested in Scala 2.8.0 with Sun JVM 1.6.0_20 on Ubuntu 10.04.
(imaier in [r25496|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25496]) Allow null components in split pane. Closes #3929.
