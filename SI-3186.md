It's hard to imagine this is what's intended for equals:
{code}
    override def equals(other: Any): Boolean = 
      other match {
        case that: Enumeration#Value => compare(that) == 0
        case _ => false
      } 
{code}
{code}
scala> object Dist1 extends Enumeration { val Mile, Foot, Inch = Value }
defined module Dist1

scala> object Dist2 extends Enumeration { val Kilometer, Millimeter, Parsec = Value }
defined module Dist2

scala> Dist1.Mile == Dist2.Kilometer
res0: Boolean = true

{code}
I figured this must have been changed because of issues with type equality after deserialization, and a little searching reveals SI-2214.  I had to address a similar problem with manifests which can be seen in r20079.  I don't know why @serialize + readResolve is not working with enums, but the right fix is ensuring that they deserialize to the same object.  The patch for 2214 instead of addressing the issue directly makes all enums with the same id equal, which I would say is adding a problem, not subtracting one.
Assigning to Philipp, since he closed SI-2214 originally. Feel free to reassign to meeting, Philipp.
(In r21235) Fixes SI-3186. Closes SI-2214.
(In r21236) Added test case for SI-3186. Closes SI-3186.
(In r21245) Fixed the serialization test. Restored the test to use the semantics of Enumeration#equals in 2.7. Made caching of Enumeration objects thread safe. See SI-3186. Review by extempore.
