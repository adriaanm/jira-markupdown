That's right. But in the 'Programming in Scala' book section 8.6 there is a - at least in my opinion - similar example: 

{code}
def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) = a + b + c
val a = sum _
a(1, 2, 3)
{code}

So I thought that my example should work too ??
But regardless of this I've noticed that always a !ClassCastException is thrown:

{code}
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer cannot be cast to scala.collection.immutable.List	
{code}
I can get around it by calling toList but if the filter-method is not allowed on the converted jList object I would except an compiler error or do I misunderstand something ?
