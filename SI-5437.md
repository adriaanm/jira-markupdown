The bug was apparent in the trunk three days ago so I believe it affects all versions.  The class under concern is scala.util.matching.Regex.

The following exception is somewhat surprising and undocumented in the scaladoc.

{code}
scala> "anything".r.replaceAllIn("anything", "\\")
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 1
       at java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:694)

As the stacktrace suggests, Java has the same behavior.

{code}
    (Pattern.compile("anything").matcher("anything").replaceAll("\\")) 
{code}

At the least, this should be documented.  More unfortunately, there is an overload for replaceAllIn that takes an anonymous function Match=>String.  Presently the user must remember to escape all backslashes and dollar signs or the code will break when certain match groups are used.  This is undocumented and unreasonable; this problem does not arise in Java.

I like the new signature for replaceAllIn, but there are shortcomings which convince me it should not be used.

Java has the following documentation for replaceAll.

At the least, the behavior should be commented in the scaladoc.  It is commented in the Javadoc.

"Note that backslashes (\) and dollar signs ($) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string. "
As an example, it's not fun (nor particularly easy) to need to escape these characters oneself.

{code}
val rel = group.replaceAllIn(template, (gm: Regex.Match) => m.groups(gm.group(1)).text.replaceAll("""\\""", """\\\\""").replaceAll("""\$""", """\\\$"""))
{code}

I propose that for this overload, the escaping is done by scala.
