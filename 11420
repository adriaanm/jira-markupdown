The Scala actors library is deprecated, we advise users to migrate to Akka actors now.

I am not able to reproduce the error locally.

{noformat}
% ~/scala/2.11/bin/scalac sandbox/test.scala && ~/scala/2.11/bin/scala -nc Test
warning: there were three deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
one warning found
6 is perfect? true

% ~/scala/2.10.4/bin/scalac sandbox/test.scala && ~/scala/2.10.4/bin/scala  -nc Test
6 is perfect? true
{noformat}

Can you please provide a transcript from a shell session that reproduces the error? Which Scala version are you using?
