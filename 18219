A blank line in a comment can cause a syntax error, as it triggers the differentiation between NEWLINE and NEWLINES tokens. For example, this is allowed:

{code}
@tailrec
/*
 Comment 1
 Comment 2
 */
def foo: Int = ???
{code}

But this gives a syntax error:
{code}
@tailrec
/*
 Comment 1
 
 Comment 2
*/
def foo: Int = ???
{code}

It might be better if blank lines within comments weren't taken into consideration.
