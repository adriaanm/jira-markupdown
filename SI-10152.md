```scala
Welcome to Scala 2.12.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_102).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> @deprecated("Foo is deprecated", "1.0.0")
     | implicit class Foo(i: Int) { def bar = i }
defined class Foo

scala> 1.bar // Expect a warning. Actually no warning
res0: Int = 1
```
The linked issue is also about synthetics getting the annotation.

Explicit def is not allowed:
```scala
scala> @deprecated("nope","forever") def C(i: Int) = new C(i) ; implicit class C(i: Int) { def doubled = i * 2 }
<console>:12: error: method C is defined twice;
  the conflicting method C was defined at line 12:42
       @deprecated("nope","forever") def C(i: Int) = new C(i) ; implicit class C(i: Int) { def doubled = i * 2 }
                                                                               ^
```
