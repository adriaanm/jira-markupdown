There is a problem with the new positions hierarchy that I cannot figure out.  The following script has an infinite loop when computing a position for an error message.
```scala
#!/bin/sh
exec scala -nocompdaemon "$$0"
!#

// test that error messages print nicely

<hello> </there>
```

I tried fixing the method that is infinitely recursing, but this led to a new problem where an exception is thrown saying "100 not valid offset in (fragment of ttt.scala)".


I have added this script as test/pending/script/errors.{scala,check}.  The check file should be pretty close, but certainly might be off by a character here and there.
