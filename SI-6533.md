This compiles:
```scala
object Test1 {
  object A { def apply[T] = new A }
   class A { def apply[T] = new A }

  A[Int][String]
}
```
This doesn't:
```scala
object Test2 {
  object A { def apply[T: TypeTag] = new A }
   class A { def apply[T: TypeTag] = new A }

  A[Int][String]
  // But this does of course: A[Int].apply[String]
}
```
There are other, similar examples where applies stop applying due to artifacts of the implementation. Some of them may be difficult to address, but this one we should just call a bug - like it says in the error message, a MethodType doesn't take type parameters.  So "follow it" if that's possible (as it is here) and apply them to the result.
```
./a.scala:45: error: method apply: (implicit evidence$1: reflect.runtime.universe.TypeTag[Int])Test2.A in object A does not take type parameters.
  A[Int][String]
        ^
one error found
```
