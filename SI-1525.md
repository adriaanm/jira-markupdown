Currently I am evaluating scala as a core of a messaging system with both messages send to objects internal and external to the virtual machine.

I wanted to measure the performance, however, run into an error which seems to be critical.

The attached example (sorry for exceeding the 24 line limit) is working fine, even under a heavy load iff I use  ` while(true){receive{ ...` in the `Actors act ` method. No problem to send 20,000,000 messages and more. Program stops, every worker terminates.

However, if I change to ` loop {react { `, even for medium loads the program fails, because 25-30% of the workers stop unexpectedly.

Environment: {code}
scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.7.2.final -- Copyright 2002-2008, LAMP/EPFL

java -version
java version "1.6.0_0"
OpenJDK  Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_0-b11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.6.0_0-b11, mixed mode)
{code}

I attached the working version, please change the `act ` method to reproduce the bug.

OK, so I found out that the problem is not related to `react` or `loop`. Instead, it seems to be a problem with the underlying thread pool. The code runs fine when using a Java 5 `Executor`. This can be done by overriding `scheduler` in class `WorkerHandler`:
```scala
override val scheduler = new scala.actors.SchedulerAdapter {
  def execute(fun: => Unit) {
    tpool.execute(new Runnable {
      def run() { fun }
    })
  }
}
```
`tpool` is declared in object `Messaging` as
```scala
val tpool = java.util.concurrent.Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)
```
Moreover, when the central handler exits we also have to shut down the executor:
```scala
if (actors == vmax && actors == deadActors) {
  println("central exit")
  tpool.shutdown()
  exit()
}
```

Using this work around I have not been able to reproduce the problem. So, it seems that in the default fork/join pool sometimes submitted tasks are either lost or not executed. I'll take a look at it, but I'm not sure it is easy to fix. Doug Lea who is the original author of the fork/join pool recommends switching to the new version which is going to be included in Java 7. The problem here is that the new code base depends on certain classes in `java.util.concurrent` which are not available on Java 1.4. I imagine that most of them could be back ported from the original JSR166 sources, though.
