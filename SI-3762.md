This is my fault (I think) but currentThread is defined in both Predef and the scala package object.  I don't know how to touch either of those without affecting binary compatibility, nor do I know whether deprecating one and not the other will play out well since if people are actually using one or the other, they are unlikely to be intentionally choosing one.

I propose the real opportunity is to deprecate both of them and eventually remove them.  I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time, but putting individual methods into the global scope is not something we should be doing without overwhelming need.  Since the introduction of package objects (so people can put currentThread in their own if they want) I don't think it's even possible to meet that test.  So I think we should phase out all the methods in Predef which are essentially "convenience" methods (but I find the convenience very questionable, because they are more often something I have to work around than something which comes in handy.)

More from the scala package object, formerly Predef: are these type aliases serving some purpose, maybe related to multiple backends? Because as far as the java side goes they achieve nothing except to mask some names in java.lang with type aliases in scala which point to java.lang.  They aren't needed to bootstrap or anything - maybe they once were.

{code}
type Throwable = java.lang.Throwable
type Exception = java.lang.Exception
type Error     = java.lang.Error

type RuntimeException                = java.lang.RuntimeException
type NullPointerException            = java.lang.NullPointerException
type ClassCastException              = java.lang.ClassCastException
type IndexOutOfBoundsException       = java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException
type ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  = java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
type StringIndexOutOfBoundsException = java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
type UnsupportedOperationException   = java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
type IllegalArgumentException        = java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
type NumberFormatException           = java.lang.NumberFormatException
type AbstractMethodError             = java.lang.AbstractMethodError
{code}
Plus these in Predef, which may also serve no purpose but I missed them in my test of the above:
{code}
type String        = java.lang.String
type Class[T]      = java.lang.Class[T]  
{code}

A frequent confusion and then annoyance of working with manifests is that the types Manifest and ClassManifest are aliased into scala._ but the companion objects aren't.  We don't do that with anything else, so we should add:
{code}
val Manifest = scala.reflect.Manifest
val ClassManifest = scala.reflect.ClassManifest  
{code}
And also:
{code}
def optManifest[T](implicit m: OptManifest[T]) = m
{code}
The print* methods are in too deep, but I think all of these can and should be deprecated:
{code}
def format(text: String, xs: Any*) = augmentString(text).format(xs: _*)

def readLine(): String = Console.readLine()
def readLine(text: String, args: Any*) = Console.readLine(text, args)
def readBoolean() = Console.readBoolean()
def readByte() = Console.readByte()
def readShort() = Console.readShort()
def readChar() = Console.readChar()
def readInt() = Console.readInt()
def readLong() = Console.readLong()
def readFloat() = Console.readFloat()
def readDouble() = Console.readDouble()
def readf(format: String) = Console.readf(format)
def readf1(format: String) = Console.readf1(format)
def readf2(format: String) = Console.readf2(format)
def readf3(format: String) = Console.readf3(format)  
{code}
I also wish we could get rid of these -- it's so easy to unwittingly call the wrong "error" or "exit" method anyway.  Backstopping all such calls with exception throwing or jvm destroying code in the global namespace just strikes me as a convenience we could live without.
{code}
def error(message: String): Nothing = throw new RuntimeException(message)

def exit(): Nothing = exit(0)

def exit(status: Int): Nothing = {
  java.lang.System.exit(status)
  throw new Throwable()
}  
{code}

(In r22775) doc comment for scala package. (did not add comment on currentThread because of see SI-3762). close SI-3750, no review.
Let's see, that's a lot of material to comment on:

currentThread: OK to deprecate everywhere. Why did we introduce it in the first place? Seems low-level.

Type aliases: I think there was a policy to import everything of value from java.lang so that we can eventually remove java.lang from the default imports. Another reason for this was platform independence. So I would leae things as they are until we see clearer on both counts.

Add Manifest companion objects and optManifest method: yes, good idea.

format can be deprecated and replaced by formatted.

I am not sure about the read methods. They are used less often than the print methods but are symmetric to them. So I'd tend to leave things as they are. No big deal to leae them in, therefore the upsets caused by changing things around would weigh more heavily.

exit should definitely be deprecated.

error shuld probably be deprecated as well.

I'd hold back with deprecations until 2.9. 

Cheers

r9110, 4 years ago: "Refactored portability support." Motivation unknown.  Moved from scala/compat/Platform.scala into Predef.
