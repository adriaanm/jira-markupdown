Don't reopen tickets after I close them.  I'm by far the most likely person to fix this and if you go out of your way to antagonize me I will be happy to never fix it.  This is an exact duplicate of 2806, which I opened, and your proposal of "fail" is not sufficiently earth-shaking to justify adding yet more noise to the trac database.

And the fact that "2806 is not solved" is what makes this a duplicate.
