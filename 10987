I am having a very similar problem...Arrow keys are not working in REPL. Getting characters. Not chinese ones :o), but different ones. For example getting `ÓH` for 'up' arrow, `ÓK` for 'left' arrow.
The CTRL+P, etc. shortcuts do work.

My environment:
Scala: 2.11.0
Windows: 8.1 Update 1, English
Windows locale settings: Slovak
