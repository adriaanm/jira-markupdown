A possible solution could be to subclass `java.lang.ref.SoftReference`, introducing a reference to the wrapper object. Then you could just cast the returned reference accordingly in `poll` and `remove` and there would be no need for the `wrappers` map any more. This might solve both scala/bug#2854 and scala/bug#2852.
