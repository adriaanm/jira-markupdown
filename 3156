A possible solution could be to subclass {{java.lang.ref.SoftReference}}, introducing a reference to the wrapper object. Then you could just cast the returned reference accordingly in {{poll}} and {{remove}} and there would be no need for the {{wrappers}} map any more. This might solve both SI-2854 and SI-2852.
