Minimization using lemon juice for the invisible ink:
{code}
scala> class Y ; def y = { val yy = new Y { class Z ; def z = new Z().getClass }; yy.z }
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined class Y
y: Class[_ <: AnyRef]

scala> y.getEnclosingClass.getName replaceAll ("\\Q$\\E", "%")
res3: String = %line4.%read%%iw%%iw%
{code}
or possibly more perspicaciously,
{code}
scala> object X { class Y; def y = new Y { class Z ; def z = classOf[Z] } } ; (X.y.getClass, X.y.z)
warning: there were 2 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined object X
res0: (Class[?0], Class[_1.Z]) forSome { type ?0 <: X.Y; val _1: X.Y{type Z <: AnyRef; def z: Class[this.Z]} } = (class X$$anon$1,class X$$anon$1$Z)

scala> (res0._1.getEnclosingClass, res0._2.getEnclosingClass)
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
res1: (Class[?0], Class[?0]) forSome { type ?0; type ?0 } = (class X$,class X$)
{code}
The encloser of Z should be {{X$$anon$1}}.



The comments of SI-6622 include a survey of the territory.
Surely this was a perfect opportunity for {{:paste -raw}} to save on lemon juice.
I tried {{:paste -cru}}. That's why we need {{:help paste}}.
