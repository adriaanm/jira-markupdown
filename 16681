There have been a [few](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3466100/are-recursive-structural-types-not-supported-in-scala-anymore) [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3201577/scala-how-to-define-a-structural-type-that-refers-to-itself) [questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8366518/is-it-possible-to-implement-liftm2-in-scala) related to recursive structural types, the answer to which is generally "Scala doesn't do that; use typeclasses instead."

Simple example:
```scala
type Num = {
  def +(n: Num): Num
}
```

I found scala/bug#3165, but it wasn't clear to me whether this duplicates that issue...
