(In r22046) also consider non-implicit locals when checking shadowing of implicits: closes SI-3453

nonImplicitSynonymInScope implements the predicate that is used in tryImplicit's checks for shadowing of locally defined implicits
benchmarking shows the predicate does not significantly affect quick.comp+quick.lib (goes from 11min to 11min2s on my machine -- no optimisations)
