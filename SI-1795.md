when doing a 
```scala
scalac scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/*.scala
```
I get two broken class file errors during code generation. It also seems to load a lot of classes during code generation, which have nothing to do with the generation process. This looks suspicious to me.
This might be linked to the fix for #1735. I reassign this to Paul.
OK, I disabled all forwarders in r17421 and reopened #363 yet again.  At the moment I don't know how else to avoid #1795, which looks like a sufficiently serious issue that forwarders should be sidelined until someone has a handle on the impact.  

I must say I didn't implement forwarders intending to take on this level of complexity -- I have other projects in the works which I understand a lot better and which I'm actually interested in.  All I personally wanted was for main() to work, but even that small ambition appears beyond me.
