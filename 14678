`Console.out.println("Les Mis�rables")` prints Les Mis?rables on my mac.
```scala
val out = new java.io.PrintStream(System.out, true, "UTF-8")
out.println("Les Mis�rables") 
```

does the right thing. See also: scala/bug#2565

Output printed by the interpreter suffers from the same issue. Should we change Console.out to wrap System.out in something that handles utf-8 properly as shown above?
