In a nightly version of Scala IDE, which is compiled against 2.10.2 or 2.11, parameterized type ascriptions on lazy vals are not highlighted anymore by semantic highlighting.

{code}
object s {
  lazy val xs: Seq[String] = ??? // Seq[String] is not highlighted
}
{code}

After debugging semantic highlighting it turned out that this is not a regression in the IDE but in the compiler because information to the type of xs don't reach the IDE side, thus it can't highlight anything.
