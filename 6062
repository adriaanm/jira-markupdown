This should be fixed now in upcoming Scala 2.10.x and Scala 2.9.x by reducing the number of redundantly declared interfaces in Scala generated classes. We seem to get down to about 4MB of LinearAlloc space with those fixes so we have a bit of buffer for now. Recent Android versions have 8MB of LinearAlloc space so those should be even safer.

Independently, [the related problem|http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=22586] in the dalvikvm was now [fixed|https://github.com/android/platform_dalvik/commit/d8a81cfd749c629de84db32eee3703cc5e0dc28f] as well. Once the change has trickled into devices (which will probably need several years) this issue should be dead several times by then :)
