There is an option -toolcp in the scala script when run under unix & cygwin. This should be available under the pure windows version in scala.bat as well. I suppose the same should be true for the other options, such as -D or -nobootcp as well.
(extempore in [r25992|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25992]) Makes -toolcp available on windows.
