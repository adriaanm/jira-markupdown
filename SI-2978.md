A typical mistake is to introduce dependancies on val or variable initializations in a class body and putting them "in the wrong order". e.g.

scala> class Schnuck { val gaga = gugu + 3; val gugu = 4 }
defined class Schnuck

scala> val x = new Schnuck
x: Schnuck = Schnuck@12e5ce6

scala> x.gugu
res0: Int = 4

scala> x.gaga
res1: Int = 3


I think the expected behaviour should be that the compiler throws an error stating that gaga is referring to an uninitialized variable, instead of producing a runtime misbehaviour.
