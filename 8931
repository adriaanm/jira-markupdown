Hey guys. I think I just ran into this one too with a new case, or at least one that hasn't been explicitly mentioned yet. 

In short: I'm getting the dreaded warning when using a subtype of an object that I have aliased in a pattern match, which in my case involves an `unapplySeq` call. Real world code snippet:
```scala
case Path.Segment(prefix, tail) â‡’ ...
```

where `Path` is a type alias defined in a package object as:
```scala
  type Path = spray.http.Uri.Path
  val Path = spray.http.Uri.Path
```

Any progress on this issue?

Scala version: 2.11.6
