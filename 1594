Yep, it happens with a new workspace and new project. Here's my source code:

{code}
package test

class Foo {
  def bar {
    println("hello, world!")
    
  }

}
{code}
Hitting TAB when the cursor is aligned with println introduces a \t. Hitting the left and right arrows, makes the cursor jump 4 spaces, while hitting left a few more times makes it move only by one space towards the beginning of the line.
