Since it is not going down without a fight, ticket time.  Adriaan observed that Array matching is being done covariantly.  So is isInstanceOf it turns out.  The following prints "1 1" but should print "2 2".
```scala
object Test {
  def f1(x: Any) = x match { 
    case _: Array[AnyRef] => 1
    case _: Array[String] => 2
    case _                => 3
  }
  def f2(x: Any) =
    if (x.isInstanceOf[Array[AnyRef]]) 1
    else if (x.isInstanceOf[Array[String]]) 2
    else 3
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(f1(args))
    println(f2(args))
  }
}
```
Inspection reveals this is happening because java is burning us once again: scala is generating the instanceof operator, and according to the JVM an Array[String] is indeed an Array[Object].

I became uncertain and verified with the specification that this should not match. It seems pretty clear that it should not.
```scala
First, unlike arrays in Java or C#, arrays in Scala are not co-variant; That is, S <: T does not imply Array[S] <: Array[T ] in Scala. However, it is possible to cast an array of S to an array of T if such a cast is permitted in the host environment.
For instance Array[String] does not conform to Array[Object], even though String conforms to Object. However, it is possible to cast an expression of type Array[String] to Array[Object], and this cast will succeed without raising a ClassCastException. Example:
```
I believe I know how to fix it, and I will now investigate this belief.
In case anyone's on the edge of their seat, I have this all fixed and there is good news and bad news.  I lack the time for a full report right now so it'll have to be tomorrow.  As a teaser, there are a number of places in the compiler expecting
```scala
  case x: Array[AnyRef] => 
```
to catch everything but the primitive arrays.  So assuming that shouldn't match, what would we like to replace it with? The problem is that this:
```scala
  case x: Array[_] =>
```
Does not give you an Array[AnyRef] on the right hand side, so you end up with lots of currently unnecessary casts.  It looks like a bug that:
```scala
  case x: Array[_ <: AnyRef] =>
```
doesn't work (it says "not found: type _$$1" or thereabouts.) However this seems to work, although I haven't properly tested.  I can't get it to compile without defining an alias.
```scala
  type AnyAnyRef = T forSome { type T <: AnyRef }
  case x: Array[AnyAnyRef]   => ...
```
Also, the patch at a point where everything works approximately as I expect is available here:

http://github.com/scala/scala/commit/927db662c607160bdc8ddb17dd96637516bcd821

The test case it passes:

Replying to [comment:10 moors]:
> the compiler should report an unreachable code error for the example above, but the matching behaviour has keep following the semantics of Java's instanceof, such is the oath we took when embarking on this journey

I think this needs further consideration.  Can we use spec citations? I missed the oath apparently.

> even if we did make a u-turn onto the high road, the worry is we'd be stuck in reflection traffic

I can't see how it's a u-turn.  The example above doesn't now and hasn't ever said unreachable code.  But if we intentionally match covariantly it remains trivial to create runtime failures.  How is it any different in effect to have Array[String] match as Array[AnyRef] in a pattern match than it is to allow Array[String] as an argument to an Array[AnyRef] parameter type? 

I can't see any point in making arrays behave invariantly everywhere else and then leaving open this huge hole for runtime failure.
```scala
(Array[String]("a"): Any) match { case x: Array[AnyRef] => x(0) = new AnyRef }
java.lang.ArrayStoreException: java.lang.Object
```
And if we're really going to make matching work right wrt type parameters when a manifest is available, we have this fairly ridiculous situation where the erased types match correctly and the type which actually reified the relevant type information has that information discarded and leads to a runtime failure.
OK, I see it in the spec now, although it seems awfully quiet.
```scala
A parameterized type pattern scala.Array[T1], where T1 is a type pattern. This type pattern matches any non-null instance of type scala.Array[U1], where U1 is a type matched by T1.
```
Running this on

```scala
scala -Yvirtpatmat
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0.r26093-b20111130020250 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_147-icedtea).
```

Results in:

```scala
scala> Test.main(null)
3
3
```

This got worse, didn't it?

Update: Weird, same behavior also with the old patter matcher ... is this a regression?
so this is really a triple-whammy bug:

1. the spec should be updated, as currently I read it as specifying covariant matching for arrays:
"A parameterized type pattern scala.Array[T1], where T1 is a type pattern.
This type pattern matches any non-null instance of type scala.Array[U1], where U1 is a type matched by T1."

"where U1 is a type matched by T1" should really read "where **a value of type U1** is matched by the type T1"
(this is consistent with the uses of "a value matched by a type" in the other bullets of 8.2)

2. implement invariant matching for arrays (including updating the analyses)

3. implement support for bounded existentials in type patterns

I agree all of these are worthwhile, but I don't think I can do this in time for 2.10.0.
Thus, demoting to major.
