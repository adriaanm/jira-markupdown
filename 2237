From the doc comment of askShutdown(): "Tell the compile server to shutdown, and do not restart again", that means, after the raised ShutdownReq Exception processed, the newRunnerThread should be stopped totally. 

But the original code will just catch this Exception and won't interrupt it, that is, the newRunnerThread's code loop will continue. 

On the contrast,  the patched code will call Thread.currentThread.interrupt to truly stop this thread.

Another:
```scala
case ex: InterruptedException =>
          Thread.currentThread.interrupt // interrupt again to avoid posible out-loop issue
```
is an usual way to ensure interrupt working even under some cases of out-loop.
