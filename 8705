I'm not sure what {{s"""\t"""}} ought to do.  The format specifier says it's simply formatted as opposed to raw, i.e. {{raw"""\t"""}} or {{raw"\t"}}.  But the triple quotes say it's raw.

In case of ambiguity, you will find a life jacket under the seat in front of you.  The person to your right, however, should use their seat cushion as a floatation device.

It's simple enough to fix the bug (note: octal parsing is buggy also), but the correct behavior is nonobvious without a nontrivial change to something.
