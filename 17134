In ScalaMock, I need to be able to tell whether a member of a class/trait is a val, var or def. To do this, I need access to the `isStable` and `isAccessor` methods. Right now, I'm accessing them like this:
```scala
def isStable(s: Symbol) = s.asInstanceOf[{ def isStable: Boolean }].isStable
      
def isAccessor(s: Symbol) = s.asInstanceOf[{ def isAccessor: Boolean }].isAccessor
```
