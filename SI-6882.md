Private constructors and methods are compiled to public visibility when a companion object access them.  This should arguably be the "most private" possible. While the Scala compiler should (and likely does, I didn't test it) enforce the visibility restrictions, when interoperating with Java, it would be preferable to have something other than public visibility here.

Per Simon Ochsenreither, the issue could be solvable by emitting an appropriate static forwarder in the class.

Example with expected results (no companion object):

{code}
class Private private(x: Int) {
  private[this] val y = x
  private def yValue = y
}
{code}

javap -p output with private constructor and method:

{code}
public class Private implements scala.ScalaObject {
  private final int y;
  private int yValue();
  private Private(int);
}
{code}

This is expected.

However, adding the companion object as follows results in the private constructor and method being generated as public.

{code}
object Private {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val p = new Private(7)
    p.yValue
  }
}
{code}

javap -p output with public constructor and method:

{code}
public class Private implements scala.ScalaObject {
  private final int y;
  public static final void main(java.lang.String[]);
  public final int Private$$yValue();
  public Private(int);
}
{code}
There's a similar issue when private methods used in closures. For example if you look at "javap -p Enumeration" output for scala.Enumeration you may notice public methods
  public scala.collection.mutable.Map<java.lang.Object, java.lang.String> scala$Enumeration$$nmap();
  public void scala$Enumeration$$populateNameMap();
despite the fact that nmap field and populateNameMap method are private in Scala code and aren't used anywhere beyond Enumeration class, but inside that class there are few closures that operate with private fields.
