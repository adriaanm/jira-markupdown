```scala
scala> val a = List("a", "b", "c")
a: List[java.lang.String] = List(a, b, c)
scala> a(-123)
res0: java.lang.String = a
scala> a(-12323123)  
res1: java.lang.String = a
```

This odd behaviour is caused by the drop method in List having a while > 0 on the index to find the correct element. The default is the first so it is always returned for negative indexes. I'm using 2.7.7 and trunk also has this problem.

Better behaviour might be having an assert on index, or for negative indexes returning from the back of the list.
you'd think this would be a trivial fix, but it looks like ParallelMatching "relies" on this.

Paul: could you please have a look at why `shortCut` returns a negative value that's later used as an index?  (`requestBody` does `targets(bx)`) 

the `shortcut` I'm talking about is called in `class MixEquals`:
```scala
      lazy val success = remake(List(
        rest.rows.head.insert2(List(NoPattern), head.boundVariables, scrut.sym),
        Row(emptyPatterns(1 + rest.tvars.size), NoBinding, NoGuard, shortCut(label))
      )).toTree
```


I added `require(bx >= 0)` to `Row` and `VariableRule` to chase this down -- you then get:

```scala
[scalacfork] Compiling 238 files to /Users/adriaan/git/scala/build/quick/classes/compiler

```

When this is fixed in the pattern matcher, feel free to re-assign to me or simply add the `require(n >= 0)` to `List::drop`. Thanks!

(In r19763) Partially addresses #2626 - pattern matcher no longer depends
on drop(n) behavior if n < 0.
I fixed the pattern matcher not to depend on the behavior, but I think putting the require in is a mistake.  First of all, if we're going to do it to drop we should do it to take as well, and either way it will draw in other methods implemented in terms of drop such as slice.  There is a test case called slices.scala which explicitly depends on negative indices working, using tests like this:
```scala
  println(List(1, 2, 3, 4).slice(-1, 1))
  println(List(1, 2, 3, 4).slice(1, -1))
  println(List(1, 2, 3, 4).slice(-2, 2))
```
And drop and take are implemented in many many locations other than List specifically, so this needs to reach down all the way to Traversable.  It represents a definitely breaking change which cannot be indicated via an annotation and where failure doesn't manifest until runtime, and doing it consistently requires altering every collections class in this way.

As usual I'm fine with breaking things, but not without some comprehensive vision behind it.  If we are going to force failure for negative indices anywhere, then every method which utilizes indices needs to be considered at the least.

Separately: why does List implement take and drop at all? What is true about "List" which is specialized beyond what is true of "LinearSeq" that would warrant reimplementing those methods (and any number of others)? If the reasons are only historical then now is a good time to do some trimming.
I think it's simple. Take and drop should accept negative indices but apply should not.
So apply is really { require(idx >= 0); drop(idx).head }. 



Replying to [comment:8 moors]:

I also wonder, but I have a tendency to assume that anything which predates me is the way it is for some good reason.  Granted, when under pressure this assumption has consistently been incorrect, but it only has to be right once in a while to be an effective deterrent.

Test case origin:

BTW I agree with martin, a negative value to apply should be a bug and has no sensible accomodation, but there's no good motivation to change take and drop.
