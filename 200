Here are a few remarks:

1) The library `ant-contrib.jar` is part of the Scala source archive and is located in directory `$$INSTALL_DIR/lib`, so `build.xml` does know its location

2) Concerning Ant itself, be sure the Ant commands are defined in the `$$PATH` variable (no user-defined shell script needed!)

3) Concerning IcedTea 1.7, we didn't try it so far, but it is based on OpenJDK 1.7 and should thus work fine too (we use Sun Java 1.7)

4) The tar Ant task produces a GNU tar; the warning messages are displayed for old tar tools that do not support long file names (see http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/tar.html)

5) `ilasm` is a development tool and is part of the `mono-devel` package (see http://hany.sk/~hany/RPM/f-updates-8-i386/mono-devel-1.2.5.1-3.fc8.i386.html)
