Problem here seems to be that `MatchError.getMessage` is throwing itself again:

{noformat}

case class Y(y: Int) extends X
case class Z(z: Int) extends X

try { 
  Y(0).toString
} catch {
  case e: Exception =>
    try {
      e.getMessage
    } catch {
      case t: Exception => "Exception.getMessage threw the following exception: " + t.getClass
    }
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined trait X
defined class Y
defined class Z
res0: String = Exception.getMessage threw the following exception: class scala.MatchError
{noformat}

Anything that attempts to report anything about this error will itself throw an exception when it tries to call `getMessage`, and since `getMessage` is rethrowing the exception, this will defeat every single layer of error reporting.
