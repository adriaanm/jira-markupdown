I don't think it is a duplicate. scala/bug#2215 discusses the case
  @BeanProperty var foo_ = "hi"
  def foo_=(s: String) = foo_ = s

And the expectation is to generate a setFoo (not setFoo_) and call foo_= (not foo__=)

I wish for a simpler case
  @BeanProperty def foo_=(s: String) = // whatever

to create a setFoo to call foo_. I think it is a lot simpler
