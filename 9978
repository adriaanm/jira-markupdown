I've cobbled together a test case, which has indeed progressed in 2.11.

{noformat}
% tail build.sbt test.scala
==> build.sbt <==
scalaVersion := "2.11.0-M4"

libraryDependencies +=  "com.google.guava" % "guava" % "14.0.1"


==> test.scala <==
object Test {
  def foo(c: com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder[_, _]) {}
}
