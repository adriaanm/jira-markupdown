I think it would be nice to have a simple reduceByKey for some collections like this:
```scala
str.split("").map(l => (l, 1)).reduceByKey(_+_)
```
I know there is an easy implementation for reduceByKey as in
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15975384/scala-reducebykey-function-use-any-type-that-has-method]
but by adding such a function to collection, we can have a faster implementation for it.
