c:> scala
scala> val lines = scala.io.Source.fromFile("an-existing-file.txt")

now switch to another console in the same directory and try to rename the file
c:> ren an-existing-file.txt another-name.txt

Windows reports an error:

The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

Return to the scala shell and exit; the rename now works.

Thus, it appears  scala.io.Source.fromFile obtains a lock on the file
which lasts as long as the Scala process is running.
From your comment it seems you're expecting the file to be loaded to memory. It uses java.io.InputStream so you're holding a handle to the file while you're manipulating it.

{noformat}scala> val source = scala.io.Source.fromFile("test.txt")
source: scala.io.BufferedSource = non-empty iterator
{noformat} 

You can release the lock with {{source.close()}}.
