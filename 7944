Incidentally, the flag/pickler relationship is more complicated, they are mapped in and out of the pickler space.  This should make it easier than you're thinking to add it.
{code}

  private def rawPickledCorrespondence = Array(
    (IMPLICIT, IMPLICIT_PKL),
    (FINAL, FINAL_PKL),
    (PRIVATE, PRIVATE_PKL),
    (PROTECTED, PROTECTED_PKL),
    (SEALED, SEALED_PKL),
    (OVERRIDE, OVERRIDE_PKL),
    (CASE, CASE_PKL),
    (ABSTRACT, ABSTRACT_PKL),
    (DEFERRED, DEFERRED_PKL),
    (METHOD, METHOD_PKL),
    (MODULE, MODULE_PKL),
    (INTERFACE, INTERFACE_PKL)
  )
