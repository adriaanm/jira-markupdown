The following is in scala/collection/Map.scala and does not seem appropriate anymore:

{code}
/** The same map with a given default function !!! todo: move to general maps? */ 
{code}

There is also a similar warning in scala/collection/mutable/Map.scala and you may consider removing it too. If you decide to keep it, please leave it as an internal comment instead of scaladoc.
