When SIP-18 warnings are not displayed, scalac may produce an incorrect count. For example:

{code}

dcs@shadowfax:~/tmp/ForwardPipe$ scalac PostFix.scala 
warning: there were 2 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
one warning found
dcs@shadowfax:~/tmp/ForwardPipe$ scalac -feature PostFix.scala 
PostFix.scala:4: warning: postfix operator != should be enabled
by making the implicit value language.postfixOps visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import language.postfixOps'
or by setting the compiler option -language:postfixOps.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.postfixOps for a discussion
why the feature should be explicitly enabled.
    val a = list filter (2 !=)
                           ^
one warning found
{code}

Hubert, could you please have a look or re-assign?
