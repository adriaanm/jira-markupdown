Allthough toString is overridden in user class, REPL obviously calls something like Iterable.toString:
```scala
class C(val i: Int) { override def toString = "C:" + i }
val c = new C(4) // REPL-output as expected: c: C = C:4

class C(val i: Int) extends Iterable[Int] {
  def iterator = Iterator(i)
  override def toString = "C:" + i }
val c = new C(4) // REPL-output now erronous: c: C = line16(4)
```

I'd expect the same output, that is
c: C = C:4

Thanks for reviewing.
