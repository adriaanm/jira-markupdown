```scala
$ grep -l static $(find files -type f) | wc -l
73

$ ./partest --grep static 
Argument 'static' matched 65 test(s)

Testing individual files
testing: [...]\files\pos\t5957                                        [  OK  ]
```

I tried to be thorough and yet courteous, to follow the exemplary excellence of the codebase by striving to improve in all things.  Mostly, I tried not to break anything by doing something stupid, so to that end it would be nice if there were tests for partest, perhaps in a future improvement.
