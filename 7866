There are "official regressions" and there are "practical regressions". Our guarantees in this area are slim to nonexistent, and would be fairly meaningless if they existed, but this is not really about java compatibility.  The fact that javac refuses to compile against the generated code should be seen as an independent opinion that there's something inconsistent about the generated code, not as something specific to javac.

I do not think this is a matter of bridges, but of generating the right signatures.  I will point against at scala/bug#3452 if you're looking into this: it is subtle.
