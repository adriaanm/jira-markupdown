```scala
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val mixedList = List(1,(1,2),4,(3,1),(5,4),6)
    for((a,b) <- mixedList) yield a
  }
}
```

No call to `withFilter` is generated.
There is another problem: the refutability checking in RefChecks, albeit somewhat ineffectual and now sometimes obviated by the (slightly overeager) checking in the parser, no longer works at all.

It suffers from two problems:

```scala
     case Apply(
        Select(qual, nme.filter | nme.withFilter),
        List(Function(
          List(ValDef(_, pname, tpt, _)),
          Match(_, CaseDef(pat1, _, _) :: _))))
        if ((pname startsWith nme.CHECK_IF_REFUTABLE_STRING) &&
            isIrrefutable(pat1, tpt.tpe) && (qual.tpe <:< tree.tpe)) =>

          transform(qual)
```

It doesn't handle TypeApply, the sort of problem that is now easily solved with treeInfo.Applied.
match nodes are eliminated by patmat under the new pattern matcher.
I've got a fix coming that uses the results of pattern matcher unreachability analysis (re-run with different assumptions about nullability) to make this work again.
A few notes from discussion with Martin:

 - the introduction of withFilter really seems to limit the usefuless of refutability checking
 - we don't really want to go down the path of typechecking both variations pending analysis of the patterns.
 - perhaps, though, we could re-spec things to say the withFilter is always included, but, the compiler
   will pass a specially tagged closure (e.g. it would have a marker trait `Constant` as a a parent),
   so that the withFilter implementation could avoid calling it.

```scala
class Option[+A] { self =>
  class WithFilter(p: A => Boolean) {
    private val isConstant = p.isInstanceOf[ConstantFunction]
    def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B] = if (isConstant) self map f else self filter p map f
    ...
  }
}
```

  - Treatment of `null` causes headaches: we ignore the possibility of null in the refutability checking (otherwise any pattern involving a type test would be refutable). Perhaps pattern generated should be changed:

```scala
  for ((x, y) <- null: Option[(Int, Int)]) yield x

  scala> val n = Some(null): Option[(Int, Int)]
  n: Option[(Int, Int)] = Some(null)

  scala> for (Tuple2(x, y) <- n) yield x
  scala.MatchError: null
	at $anonfun$1.apply(<console>:9)
	at $anonfun$1.apply(<console>:9)
	at scala.Option.map(Option.scala:145)

  scala> n withFilter { case (x, y) => true; case _ => false } map { case (x, y) => x }
  res4: Option[Int] = None


  // if refutability checking worked as originally intended, and the `withFilter` was elided.
  // will throw a NPE
  scala> n map { case (x, y) => x }
  scala.MatchError: null

  // Tentative proposal: the predicate should admit null.
  scala> n withFilter { case (x, y) => true; case null =>; case _ => false } map { case (x, y) => x }
```
Speaking of "val isConstant" take a look at: https://github.com/paulp/scala/tree/wip/predicates

At the time I was pursuing unnecessary allocations of Function1 (especially for _ => true and _ => false) but there are more uses, as you see.
```scala
final class Predicate[@specialized T](val f: T => Boolean, val isFlipped: Boolean) extends (T => Boolean) 
...

  fun match {
    // Rewrite _ => true and _ => false to reuse preallocated constant predicates
    case Function(vparam :: Nil, Literal(Constant(v: Boolean))) =>
      enterSym(context, vparam)
      if (context.retyping) context.scope enter vparam.symbol
      val formal    = typedValDef(vparam).symbol.tpe
      val funtpe    = appliedType(clazz, formal, BooleanClass.tpe)
      val predicate = termMember(FunctionModule, "Predicate" + v.toString.capitalize)

      typed(gen.mkNullaryCall(predicate, formal :: Nil), funtpe)
```
