I am using Eclipse 3.5.1 with Scala 2.8r19928 on Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) and I cannot reproduce this bug.

The step I follow are:
 1. Create Scala Project
 2. Set the default encoding to ISO-8859-1 (via Project properties)
 3. Create a Scala file with some arbitrary code
 4. Save the file
 5. Paste the comment _// Comment ���_ from the bug report above
 6. Save, close and reopen the file
 7. Add some code and save the file several times trying to trigger the bug


At all times the syntax highlighting works as expected.
