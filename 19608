Running the following with specs2 will pass on windows but fail on mac.
```
class MultilineStringTest extends Specification {

  "multi-line string literal should use platform line separator (fails on mac, passes on windows)" >> {
    """
    |""".stripMargin must_== sys.props("line.separator")
  }
}
```

It seems that new lines within multi-line literals are always \r\n rather than being set to the platform specific. Looks like it only affects IntelliJ IDEA as running the test from SBT doesn't fail on mac.
