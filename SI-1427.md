Removed everything but distilled test case.
{code}
class Bob[K[_]] {
  def foo(other: Any) = other match {
    case x: (Bob[X] forSome { type X[_] })  => 
  }
}
{code}
(In r23159) Still giddy with the thrill of fixing SI-266, I vanquish another
pattern matcher bug from the dawn of time.  If you've always wanted
to write code like this:

  class Bob[K[_]] {
    def foo(other: Any) = other match {
      case x: (Bob[X] forSome { type X[_] })  =>
    }
  }

Now is your chance.  Closes SI-1427, review by moors.  (Is there
a better way to "shake off" the pattern existential?)
