Really? I had no trouble reproducing it on OSX, but you must have made a mistake, there's no way it's platform specific.  The bug is triggered by an array creation where the type is inferred as an intersection type (in this case "Colour with Product"), possibly a bug in the calculation of the manifest.  (Shouldn't it be the erased type for this purpose?)

Here is shorter source which should fail for you with the beta or current trunk.
{code}
object Bug {
  abstract class Colour
  case object RED extends Colour
  case object YELLOW extends Colour
  val items = Array(RED, YELLOW)
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = items foreach println
}
{code}
