We should deprecate NotNull and corral its implementation in the compiler. Its implementation has been unfinished since 2.5.
The implementation has always been behind a -Y option, and for 2.10.0 I labeled it in an even more threatening fashion:
{noformat}
  -Ynotnull                           Enable (experimental and incomplete) scala.NotNull.
{noformat}
So as far as I'm concerned we should deprecate the empty scala.NotNull trait for 2.11.0 but we are within our rights to remove all of the implementation which underlies it immediately.
I've just switched to Scala 2.11 and just realized that {{NotNull}} has been deprecated. In fact, it appears that it has been more than deprecated, since it's no longer possible to specify {{-Ynotnull}} as a compiler option. Thanks for the discussion and heads-up! ;-)

I understand and appreciate that this feature was experimental and never fully implemented. Nevertheless, I found it extremely valuable: the ability to enforce non-*null* references for certain types is something Scala can and should support. I don't particularly want to either trap *null* references, nor do I want to accommodate {{NullPointerException}} exceptions being thrown all over the place, so having base classes extend {{NotNull}} was a simpler, neater alternative - assuming that it actually worked, of course. Instead, a compile-time error that you cannot initialize a {{NotNull}} instance with *null* is elegant, simple and straightforward.

So, given that {{NotNull}} has been nuked, is there any proposed alternative that doesn't involve either utilizing a ton of _check-not-null_ boilerplate or {{NullPointerException}} handling - including all the cumbersome overhead of extra unit tests to guarantee that null references are being handled correctly?
Just my two cents, but I feel like {{Option}} is what you're looking for. It solves all the {{NotNull}} problems much more effectively.

The only up-side to {{NotNull}} that I see is that you can mix it into a class definition directly, but when you're writing a class you don't know how users of that class will eventually intend to reference it. Mixing in {{NotNull}} at that point feels inappropriate.

On the other hand, at the declaration of the variable you could just as easily declare an {{Option\[Foo\]}}, and simply never use null in your code ever. You'll still have to check at system-boundaries (IO, Java libraries, etc.) but you can easily wrap those in an {{Option(reference)}} and the {{Option}} class will automatically wrap it in a {{Some}} or {{None}} as appropriate.

This also gives you all of your {{map}}, {{flatMap}}, and {{filter}} operations, as well as your {{orElse}} method calls for when you want a default value.

Is there some area that an Option doesn't cover for you?

(Edit: Sorry, goofed the formatting)
Sorry, Travis, but {{Option}} doesn't even come close.

The need for {{NotNull}} is illustrated by the fact that any reference type can be *null*, but trapping *null* values or handling exceptions arising from dereferencing a *null* value - or even having to wrap references in {{Option}} - is a high overhead if there is no benefit whatsoever from having *null* values in the first place. Not only that, but you would (or should) have to write unit tests to verify that passing *null* references around doesn't cause collateral damage.

{{NotNull}} combined with {{-Ynotnull}} was intended to make assignment of *null* to a {{NotNull}}-derived type - as well as casting *null* reference values to such a type - illegal. Consider the following:

{code:scala}
class SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType extends NotNull {
  // ...
}

def doSomething (x: SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType) = {
  // x is guaranteed not to be null, so dereferencing x will not cause an NPE to be thrown.
  // Also, there is also no need to trap whether x is null, or to wrap x in an Option.
  // Furthermore, I don't have to write a unit test to verify what happens if x is null. Can't happen.
  // ...
}

def willNotWork = {
  // ...
  val y: SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType = null // <- results in a compiler error
  val z = somePossiblyNullReference // <- results in compiler error
  // ...
}
{code}

What you seem to be suggesting as an alternative is to wrap every single reference to such a class in an {{Option}} - that is, I have to use {{Option \[SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType\]}} instead of simply {{SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType}} which makes no sense to me whatsoever.

Ironically, this doesn't even solve the problem since you can initialize an {{Option \[T\]}} will *null* (it's a reference type after all):

{code:scala}
val x: Option [String] = null
val s: = x.getOrElse ("x is null") // Whoops! Get an NPE!
{code}

so even {{Option}} would benefit from extending {{NotNull}}!
Actually, my suggestion is the opposite of {{Option\[SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType\]}}.

That is, as I said you ban {{null}} from the interior of your system completely. It never exists, ever. If you have something that can never be null, you just reference it directly. You only use the Option in instances where you're not sure if you have it or not:
{code}
var x: SomeCanNeverBeNull = nonNullReference;
var y: Option[SomeCanNeverBeNull] = Option(nullableReference); // Oops, it actually was null, but we handled it cleanly
{code}

That is, you seem to be assuming that nullable is your default and you're flagging non-null cases. My understanding of idiomatic Scala code was that you should consider all variables non-nullable, and flag values that might not be present as {{Option}}.

If you do your null-checks at system boundaries (IO, etc.) and when calling Java libraries, a {{null}} should literally never enter your system. You shouldn't have to write unit tests around them, or boiler-plate null-checking code, because they just don't exist.

YMMV, and my take might be wrong, but I never get a {{NullPointerException}} inside a system unless I forget a check at the system boundary.
Sure you can ban *null* from the interior of your system (still, enforcement is more complex than using {{NotNull}}). I detest *null* and never, ever use it (aside from when forced to by _Java_). Also, I know how to use {{Option}}, thank you very much. ;-)

I would guess that, since no-one is infallible, even you occasionally forget to check for *null* at a system boundary and get _NPEs_ - and then proceed to waste precious development time diagnosing, fixing and testing for them. (Unit testing for *null* is, therefore, _very much_ required at the system boundary.)

All the same, what if, like me, you're designing an _API_? In that case, nullable *is* the default. You have zero enforcement over banning use of *null* in your user's code. Every single time a reference value is passed to that API, you have to consider the possibility that the value might be *null* - even if there's no logical need for it (a prime example being an {{Option}} instance). System boundaries can be _big_! The task can be made a lot simpler if you can enforce that certain types be non-*null* through the compiler - and that's what {{NotNull}} (used to) provide.
Sorry, didn't mean to imply you didn't know how to use {{Option}}. I misinterpreted the reason why you thought I was suggesting wrapping every {{SomeCannotPossiblyBeNullType}} instead of just the ones at system boundaries that might be null.

It sounds like we're mostly on the same page though, with just a few different default assumptions separating our different approaches.

My answer to your "what if" is that it depends on the API and what a failure might cause. If the failures would be critical and damaging, such as aborting in the middle of a vital transaction, I would null-check at boundaries. Otherwise, I would classify that as a failure of the API user, and not bother checking. (In my case, that user will probably be "future me" most of the time. I accept that.)

That's just my approach, it's worked for me so far.
The only reason I said anything at all is that I also detest null, and having both {{NotNull}} and {{Option}} feels inconsistent to me.

Then again, if I got my way I'd also disallow usage of {{null}} at the compiler-level unless enabled by a flag (since Java interop needs it). I'm secretly hoping that since Java 8 now has its own {{Option}}, maybe they'll remove null completely in a future version. One can wish.
Adriaan, thanks for your response. As for the feature not working "at all", I tested it and found it worked pretty well, but I accepted that it was incomplete and that there might be a surprise or two in store. There are other experimental features in Scala 2.10 that were in common use (e.g. macros), so I assumed that you guys were working on finishing the job. C'est la Vie.

So, you've removed it. Fine - I accept that. However, going back to my original comment, is there any proposed alternative functionality (provide references that are guaranteed not to be *null*)?

Also, I'm curious: what were the difficulties/holes in implementing this feature?
The original implementation only caught blatant assignments of null to a NotNull type. As Paul alluded to, tracking non-nullness is a form of effect tracking, which is much trickier than regular type checking because it's flow sensitive (e.g., `val x = if(foo) notNull else null; ... ; if(foo) methodExpectingNotNull(x)` is a common pattern that requires flow sensitivity/full dependent types to type check). More generally, it likely requires whole-program analysis to get good results (but that still doesn't solve how to do java interop).

There are no plans to replace NotNull at the moment, though some Scala 3.x release may gain effect tracking, or some lint-like tool could do a static analysis.

Here are two relevant papers that should give you a sense of how it could work: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/krml109.pdf, http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/masked-types.pdf (nullness interferes with initialization)

Paul, Adriaan, thanks to you both for your comments. Not for the first time, it appears to be a much more complex issue than I had assumed. Maybe it's easier just to deprecate *null*? ;-) In any case, I'll be sure to follow-up your links: guaranteed non-null reference types would seem to be a natural fit with Scala and would sure make life easier for a lot of us.

Also, as for static checking, I should point out (for anyone interested) that [Scalastyle|http://www.scalastyle.org/] includes a test for the use of *null* - highly recommended!
