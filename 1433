Is here a second option controlling the stack size for scalac, within Eclipse?
I know how to adjust my Eclipse heap size, and it is already increased, and
next I will adjust the stack size.  (But in general, if you suggest that a bug
reporter "try X", including some guidance for trying X would be helpful.)

In addition, I see these error messages in the Error log on startup:
```scala
While loading class "lampion.presentation.Presentations$$",
thread "Thread[worker-PFC,1,main]" timed out waiting (5000ms)
for thread "Thread[org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.JavaReconciler,1,main]"
to finish starting bundle
"reference:file:plugins/ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core_2.8.0.r16829-b20081231022423.jar r299".
To avoid deadlock, thread "Thread[worker-PFC,1,main]" is proceeding but
"lampion.presentation.Presentations$$" may not be fully initialized.
```

and
```scala
While loading class "scala.tools.eclipse.javaelements.ScalaCompilationUnitFilter",
thread "Thread[main,6,main]" timed out waiting (5000ms) for thread
"Thread[org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.JavaReconciler,1,main]" to finish starting bundle
"reference:file:plugins/ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.core_2.8.0.r16829-b20081231022423.jar r299".
To avoid deadlock, thread "Thread[main,6,main]" is proceeding but
"scala.tools.eclipse.javaelements.ScalaCompilationUnitFilter" may not be fully initialized.
```

Is this perhaps relevant?  Is there an option I could adjust that might increased the timeout setting to see if that would help?
