@Arseniy:

I think you misunderstood what Adriaan said. You said that user-defined extractors are total, but Scala does not and cannot check that (for the general case anyway -- it's theoretically possible to detect trivial cases). Since it can never decide whether a pattern with user-defined extractors is exhaustive or not, it simply turns that feature off, therefore not warning in cases where it could make a statement to the effect that the matching is definitely not exhaustive.

Anyway, given that the pattern matcher cannot warn non-exhaustiveness correctly, it doing so in some cases might lead people to think that absence of a warning as an assertion of exhaustiveness (which it is not).
