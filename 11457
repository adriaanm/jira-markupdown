I don't think we can break the invariant that:
```scala
def prop(t: Throwable): Boolean = try { Try(throw t).get } catch t1: Throwable => t1 eq t }
```

However we might consider using `Throwable#setStackTrace` to augment the stack trace. We'd need to find other frameworks/libraries that use that to understand if it is possible/advisable.
