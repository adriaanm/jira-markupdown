Imports have a source name and the name (possibly a rename) to bring into scope.  The algo in REPL to decide what to import is tripped up by the import handler not distinguishing them correctly.  In the sample, normally it would bump the first import to an outer scope (and let normal shadowing effectively eliminate it).  (Open question whether that inefficiency has any benefit; it doesn't try to nuance anything.)

it is imported twice in the same scope by

"Open question whether that inefficiency has any benefit; it doesn't try to nuance anything."

Having tried, I'll tell you it's harder than it looks to incrementally improve on the current approach, because it's tricky to be sure you can omit an import entirely. Wildcard imports with lower scope, implicits, renames, and then there is the little feature where a name might be shadowed in only one namespace, like this:
```scala
object Foo {
  class Bar
  object Bar
}
object Quux {
  class Bar
}

object Test {
  import Foo.Bar

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    import Quux.Bar
    new Bar
    Bar
  }
}
```
This has been fixed in the [Ammonite REPL](http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL).

```scala
@  object Foo { def bar = 7 }
defined object Foo
@  object Junk { val x = 7 }
defined object Junk
@ import Foo.{ bar => baz }
import Foo.{ bar => baz }
@  import Junk.{x=>baz}
import import Junk.{x=>baz}
@ baz
res24: Int = 7
@ object Foo { def bar = 7 }
defined object Foo
@ object Junk { val x = 8 }
defined object Junk
@ import Foo.{ bar => baz }
import Foo.{ bar => baz }
@ import Junk.{x=>baz}
import Junk.{x=>baz}
@ baz
res29: Int = 8
@
```
