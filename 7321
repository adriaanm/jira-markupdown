The irony is that it forgets to remind itself, but succeeds in reminding java: the generic signatures look right.
```
scala> classOf[F$mcI$sp].getDeclaredMethods map (_.toGenericString) foreach println
public abstract R F$mcI$sp.f(int)
public abstract scala.Function1<java.lang.Object, R> F$mcI$sp.g()
public abstract scala.Function1<java.lang.Object, R> F$mcI$sp.g$mcI$sp()
```
Except, why are there two signatures attached to f and g, is that normal?
```
const #3 = Asciz	f;
const #4 = Asciz	(I)Ljava/lang/Object;;
const #5 = Asciz	(I)TR;;
const #7 = Asciz	g;
const #8 = Asciz	()Lscala/Function1;;
const #9 = Asciz	()Lscala/Function1<Ljava/lang/Object;TR;>;;
```
