Not sure if my cell-phone replies reached here or the list, but here they are:

1. That the item returned was at some point in the map, is what my PR is specifically addressing (ignore the implementation proposed above, the PR is different and correct).
2. The default in `concurrent.Map` that you propose is the way to go! Great, and I'll submit a PR, unless you beat me to it.
3. The `computeIfAbsent` part is debatable. We previously strived for `concurrent.Map` trait to mirror the `j.u.c.ConcurrentMap` interface. For conversion purposes and for consistency, I'd be inclined to keep it that way, and add the new method, especially since it can be implemented with a reasonable default. The `adjust` method does exactly what `compute` does, modulo the fact that there is no key involved in the `adjust` you propose.
