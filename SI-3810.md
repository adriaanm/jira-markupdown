This is in 2.8.0-final.

I compiled the below source with flags -optimize -Yclosure-elim -Ydead-code -Ydetach -Yinline. All other compiler options are as per the Scala Eclipse IDE defaults.

Received 4 warnings, "Encountered open block in isSafeToInline: this indicates a bug in the optimizer! ..."

package church

object Church {
  @inline
  private def church(n: Int)(f: Int => Int)(x: Int): Int = {
    if (n == 0)
      x
    else
      church(n - 1)(f)(f(x))
  }

  @inline
  private def unchurch(f: (Int => Int) => Int => Int): Int =
    f(_ + 1)(0)

  def main(argv: Array[String]) {
    val zero = church(0)_

Duplicate of #3500, marked as fixed two days ago.  Also, the guidelines it tries to insist you read before opening a ticket would have informed you how to mark up code so  the formatting isn't destroyed.
