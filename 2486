yes, but that could also be achieved by using `<%<` instead of `=>` for the implicit arg of `flatten` and annotating `<%<` so that you get a message more suitable to the type mismatch that it implies

that is, once I fix SI-3346 or SI-3340, or both -- whatever was blocking that (don't remember off the top of my head)
