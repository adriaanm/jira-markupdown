I scratched my head at this a bit, but ijuma on IRC helped me understand what gestalt probably meant.
I think he means more like this:
```scala
def foo(implicit value: Int) = println(value)

for (implicit elem <- Array(1,2,3)) foo
```

It would require, I suppose, changing the for-comprehension expansion from
```scala
for (p <- e) e'
```
becoming
```scala
e.foreach { case p => e' }
```

to something like
```scala
e.foreach { dummy => [implicit] val p = dummy ; e' }
```
