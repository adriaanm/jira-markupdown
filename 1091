I scratched my head at this a bit, but ijuma on IRC helped me understand what gestalt probably meant.
I think he means more like this:
{code}
def foo(implicit value: Int) = println(value)

for (implicit elem <- Array(1,2,3)) foo
{code}

It would require, I suppose, changing the for-comprehension expansion from

{code}
for (p <- e) e'
{code} 
becoming
{code}
e.foreach { case p => e' }
{code}

to something like
{code}
e.foreach { dummy => [implicit] val p = dummy ; e' }
{code}
