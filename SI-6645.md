The original version of TextPane.scala : https://gist.github.com/4049794
It compiles with reflectiveCalls warnings. To eliminate the warnings, I modified it into this:
https://gist.github.com/4049800 and the compilation failed with Error messages:

[error] error while loading Vector$1, class file '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_07.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar(java/util/Vector$1.class)' is broken
[error] (class java.util.NoSuchElementException/key not found: E)
[error] one error found
[error] (compile:compile) Compilation failed
