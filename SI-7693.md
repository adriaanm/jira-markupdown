Suggesting that an implicit function scope should be ignored within the actual defining code of that function, because it could never result in a logical operation (infinite loop) the compiler should not consider it a valid option. Forgive me if this is more of an improvement item, I was not sure how to classify this. Thank you
Not "never". This is a little contrived, but it is meant to illustrate that you have to think hard before ruling out possibilities a priori.
```scala
object Test {
  case class Foo(s: String)
  implicit def stringToInt(s: String)(implicit v: Foo): Int = {
    def join = if (v eq null) s else s + v.s
    if (v eq null) s.length
    else {
      implicit val v: Foo = null
      join
    }
  }
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    implicit val foo = Foo("def")
    println("abc": Int) // prints 6
  }
}
```
For that matter the implicit could be something like
```scala
implicit def f(s: String): Int = if (s.length > 5) s.length else s + "a"
```
which also works fine.
