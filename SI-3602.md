scalac does not appear to honor Java 5 {{@SuppressWarnings}} annotations, even where it makes sense, notably {{@SuppressWarnings(Array("unchecked"))}}.

Unchecked warnings are helpful, and using {{@SuppressWarnings}} in this way is basically a declaration that "I know what I'm doing" for a particular method/class/object/trait that intentionally does things erasure makes unsafe, without disabling unchecked warnings everywhere.
