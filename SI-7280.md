No scope completion on members imported from an object. Vals are not found at all. Methods are found, unless the import is **inside** a `def`.

This suggests that the presentation compiler mistreats imports in the Context used for completions.

```scala
object Cont {
  val myVal = 42
  def longName() {}
}

import Cont._
object T{

  def foo {
    /*!*/ // `myVal` does not show up, but `longName` does
  }
}
```
IDE ticket: [#1001615](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1001615)
There are 2 problems reported in this ticket: vals not being found, and defs not being found sometime.

Some information about the vals is provided by scope completion. Scala IDE currently filters out this information. We will see if it can be fixed on the Scala IDE side, or if we need to open another ticket for this case.

So, the remaining test case for the defs is the following:

```scala
object Cont {
  def longName() {}
}

class ImportOut {
  import Cont._

  def foo {
    /*_*/   // `longName` is in the scope members
  }
}

class ImportIn {
  def foo {
    import Cont._
    /*_*/   // `longName` is not in the scope members
  }
}
```
I discussed this one quickly with Iulian last week. I think `ContextTrees#locateContext` is at fault.

It seems we have no tests at all for scope completion. I extended InteractiveTest to support this on a branch: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/scala:2.10.x...ticket%2Fcompletion2
