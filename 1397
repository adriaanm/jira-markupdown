It seems to me that the spec requires an unchecked warning to be issued. SLS 12.1 defines asInstanceOf in terms of pattern matching, and SLS 8.2 says that "The Scala compiler will issue an “unchecked” warning for these patterns to flag the pos- sible loss of type-safety."

If we don't want a warning here, then it seems to me that a spec change is needed in order not to require one. see also scala/bug#1447
