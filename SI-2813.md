I know the jcl package is going away in 2.8 so I'm not sure if bug reportss are still being entertained...

Buffer.addAll violates the contract of java.util.List.addAll, which throws "IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the index is out of range (index < 0 || index > size())." Index == 0 is always a legal value. It should be possible to append to an empty list using addAll.

Buffer.addAll will throw NoSuchElementException if it is empty and index == 0.

```scala
scala> val l = new scala.collection.jcl.LinkedList[Int]
l: scala.collection.jcl.LinkedList[Int] = []

scala> l.addAll(0, List(1,2,3))
java.util.NoSuchElementException
        at java.util.LinkedList$$ListItr.next(LinkedList.java:698)
        at scala.collection.jcl.MutableIterator$$Wrapper.next(MutableIterator.scala:16)

        at scala.collection.jcl.Buffer$$class.addAll(Buffer.scala:109...
```
I just found something much worse.

```scala
scala> l
res21: scala.collection.jcl.LinkedList[Int] = [10, 11, 12]

scala> l.addAll(0, List(1,2,3,4))
java.util.NoSuchElementException

scala> l
res23: scala.collection.jcl.LinkedList[Int] = [10, 1, 11, 2, 12, 3]
```
I overrode addAll in my code to work around these problems. Here's my version:

```scala
  override def addAll(idx: Int, that: Iterable[A]): Unit = {
    val i = elements
    if (idx > 0) {
      i.seek(idx - 1)
    }
    for (that <- that) {
      i.add(that)
    }
  }
```
Proposal for a patch to correct the issue:[[BR]]
In scala.collection.jcl.BufferWrapper replace the lines:
```scala
  override def addAll(idx : Int, that : Iterable[A]) = that match {
    case that : CollectionWrapper[_] => underlying.addAll(idx, that.underlying); {}
    case _ => super.addAll(idx, that);
  }
```
with
```scala
  private def internalAddAll(idx : Int, that : Iterable[A]) {
    val v = underlying.subList(0, idx);
    for (t <- that) {
      v.add(t)
    }
  }
  override def addAll(idx : Int, that : Iterable[A]) = that match {
    case that : CollectionWrapper[_] => underlying.addAll(idx, that.underlying); {}
    case _ => internalAddAll(idx, that);
  }
```

A few notes:
 * I'm a newbie (to Scala - but a long time IT-professional)
 * I compiled and tested (ant + ant test) the current 2.7.x branch with the change above - without errors.
 * I of course wrote a few tests to reproduce the problem and verify that it was corrected after the change. I sadly found no description/hint on how to write unit-tests that can be integrated in the Scala build. I actually found an entry in the scala-incubator google-group that lead me to think that no unit-test framework has yet been defined/chosen for unit testing in Scala. Therefore I do not offer any unit tests for the change - which doesn't make me happy...
 * The change is - from my point of view at least - as unintrusive as possible. But I certainly don't know enough about Scala yet to be able to anticipate which    unexpected side-effects the change could have on existing code based on the current implementation.
 * I don't know how the next steps could look like. Whether someone will have a look at my proposal, retest it, integrate it to the code base... I'm working on becoming a contributor to Scala in the near future, but I'm not there yet ;-)

That's good.

Have a look at the tests in test/files directory. Usually you would be interested in pos/neg/run (meaning files that should compile, shouldn't and should be run, respectively).
It would be indeed crucial to have tests for that.

Every contribution is appreciated. Usually reassigning the bug to scala_reviewer will do the job and someone will pick the patch from there.
I'm guessing this isn't going to be applied to any 2.7 version at this point.  I modified the test case for 2.8 (and it passes for r22171).  The main part is just changing the imports to:
```scala
import java.util.LinkedList
import collection.JavaConversions._
```
and checking against a Seq instead of !LinkedList.  It isn't semantically identical, but it might still be useful.  Updated version attached.
(In r23068) Test case submitted by mark harrah closes #2813, no review.
