I am reopening this issue as package objects still can not be deprecated and from the the comments and commits I can not see the clear resolution for that matter. 

I would like to deprecate the whole package and I can not do it in any way except by going to all public classes and objects and annotating them with @deprecated. In my case the package has quite a few classes and annotating them is not negligible work.
