There's no particular problem with the qualifier being required in the Scala source, however the error doesn't go away if you compile OuterInterface.java, AbstractImpl.java along with ConcreteImpl2.scala: scalac still reports an error against the Java.

The problem here is that it forces existing correct Java code to be modified before it can be used in a mixed Scala/Java project.
