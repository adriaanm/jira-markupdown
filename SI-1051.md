Java defines an efficient and covariant clone method on arrays, but Scala doesn't expose this on its array class. It should.

I can file this as a SIP if you want, but it seems sufficiently minor and such an obviously good idea that it doesn't seem worth it. 
If nobody writes an analogue patch for .NET, it would still be possible to implement the clone() method in scala.Array using a loop. While not fast, this would at least work (for 2.8).
{code}
def clone():Array[A] = {
  val r = new Array[A](this.length);
  for(i <- 0 until this.length){
    r(i) = this(i);
  }
  r
}
{code}
(In r20543) Exposed native Array clone() method.  Closes SI-1051.
