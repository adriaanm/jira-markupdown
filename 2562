This bug has the same root cause as scala/bug#1133, but breaking differently.  The pattern matcher algorithm constructs a DFA, which is fine most of the time but generates very deeply nested if/else code under conditions like nested Lists.  The typer then tries to type the if expression recursively, which is usually fine because normal people don't nest their if/elses 100 layers deep.

You can add more stack for now with -Xms.  I know how to fix it but I have quite a few more fundamental correctness issues in front of me first.
