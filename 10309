What? "When type applications are expected to be partial once in a while", have you thought this through? How are you supposed to know what the rest of the world is going to do with your types?  

Not to mention it's disingenuous to suggest one is ever likely to have such freedom that one can hop between type members and type parameters. There are a billion things which constrain this choice - most of them are implementation bugs or inadequacies by design - never once will anyone be so free of those constraints that they'll be able to say "I'll make this a type member because I expect it to be partial once in a while."
