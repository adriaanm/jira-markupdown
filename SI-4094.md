scala.concurrent.SyncVar should not silently swallow InterruptedException within its get(Long) method. As the matter of fact it should not catch the exception at all (same as get() method does), considering that SyncVar.get() can perform no useful processing for the exception here: at very least, it should reraise the Thread.currentThread.interrupt() flag after catching the exception, but this is still bad as it results in aliasing None result for two things 'timeout happened' and 'thread was interrupted' keeping the calling code still unaware of the possibly pending interrupt.

While here, I see yet another problem in the same method: the get(Long) method uses if (!isDefined) instead of while (!isDefined) thus is vulnerable against spurious wakeups (which JLS explicitly allows to happen). Unfortunately the Object.wait(Long) does not report remaining timeout, so the correct implementation of the method looks a little bit complicated:

{code}
def get(timeout: Long): Option[A] = synchronized {
	var rest = timeout
	while (!isDefined && (rest > 0)) {
		val t0 = System.currentTimeMillis
		wait(timeout)
		if (!isDefined) {
			val t1 = System.currentTimeMillis
			val tdiff = t1 - t0
			if (tdiff > 0) rest -= tdiff // protect against system clock changed into past
			// if system clock jumped into future, detecting that will be harder,
			// but at least it will not result in arbitrary increase of timeout
		}
	}
	if (isDefined) Some(value)
	else None
}
{code}

Note: this implementation does not follow the unfortunate java notation of 'zero timeout means infinitely long'. Instead, zero means exactly that - 'do not wait at all', while 'infinitely long' is naturally represented by Long.MaxValue for all practical senses (but even better to call get() if waiting forever (or till interrupt()) is needed). This change should be ok considering that SyncVar never carried scaladoc promising any non-monotonic behaviour with zero timeout.

The time math can be redone by using java.util.concurrent.locks.Cond.awaitNanos(long) method (which returns remaining time to sleep), if using that class does not breach any scala policy. Unfortunately, awaitNanos(long) operates in terms of nanoseconds not milliseconds, so some math will still be needed for large values including Long.MaxValue (but the extra gettimeofdate syscall or equivalent could be avoided, at least on some systems). But if to silently clump (or disallow) huge timeouts downto Long.MaxValue/1000000 (ms-to-ns ratio; that's almost 300 years if I still am able to count), the loop will become trivial. BTW Cond is exactly what is emulated with object lock in the current SyncVar implementation.
(In r24087) SyncVar should not swallow interrupts and should be robust
against spurious wakeups.  Closes SI-4094, review by prokopec.
(What did you mean in your comment that it is vulnerable
against the take method?)
The fix as introduced in the r24087 and r24094 has few problems.

First, the line
{code}
	while (!isDefined && rest >= 0) {
{code}

should REALLY be

{code}
	while (!isDefined && rest > 0) {
{code}

otherwise we end up calling java.lang.Object.wait(0) i.e. basically blocking forever effectively ignoring the timeout argument of the get(Long).

Second, the code

{code}
		if (!isDefined && elapsed > 0)
			rest -= elapsed
{code}

should better be just

{code}
		rest -= elapsed
{code}

(at most one background extra bool cache/memory write per entire loop (most likely, merely a register assignment) is better than an extra condition/branching per each loop iteration), while the line

{code}
	System.currentTimeMillis - start
{code}

in waitMeasuringElapsed(Long) should explicitly overtake the 'clock gone backward' safety check:

{code}
	val diff = System.currentTimeMillis - start
	if (diff < 0) 0 else diff
{code}

if then the waitMeasuringElapsed(Long) prepended with a line:

{code}
	if (timeout <= 0) return 0
{code}

ensuring that calling the potentially infinitely blocking wait(0) call will never happen with timed wait, the function waitMeasuringElapsed(Long) becomes robust enough to deserve being a part of [some future] public API (not from SyncVar class, of course). Good news is that in context of the function get(long) this added line will be totally eliminated by JIT, as the negative comparison (rest > 0) happens just before, ensuring that in this particular invocation the condition (timeout <= 0) will be always false.

Third, the argument for the waitMeasuringElapsed(Long) call should be {{rest}}, not the entire {{timeout}}, obviously.

Forth, the added @volatile modifier for fields isDefined and value is not needed, and even makes certain harm performance wise. All accesses to those private variables are already guarded by this.synchronized {} sections, and the fact that wait(Long) call basically gives up the semaphore and then obtains it again (as per JVM specs) ensures that full memory barrier occurs here, so the synchronized body of the method get(long) always sees up to date values for those variables - declaring them @volatile causes extra barried (read: slow, up to 300-400 CPU tacts) RAM references, towards isDefined variable in particular.
Last time I checked, SyncVar class was an auxilary part of implementation of Actor.receive(long) for example - and there performance matters, matters really alot: will anyone argue against the fact that actors library is one of the few most important parts of Scala - and actors performance is among its strongest points?

Is there any way I could help to expedite the suggested corrections go into the source code repository ASAP?

I don't think JIT is allowed to optimize out @volatile even within syncrhonized block, or will do that any time soon. The problem is, nothing really prevents JVM code to asynchronously change the same variable without holding an appropriate lock (or any lock at all, for that matter). Also, all the 'synchronized' magic applies at the synchronized block boundaries only, it does not change semantics nor place any limits on inner operations at all. Indeed, looking at the source code, the facts that

-- a variable is private
-- all its usages are 'right here'
-- all its usages are synchronized

give a hope, but hope no more. First, JIT always worked and works by compiling/optimizing separate method separately (inlining callees, but not bothering about neighbours) - compliling class at once (inluding those methods that will not be called at all, and those which will end executed just once of twice during VM lifetime and thus are better interpreted not compiled) would slow down JVM program starting phase quite a bit. Second, the value of the private variable might be changed (without proper synchronization again) asynchronously via reflection API - ugly, but true. Only precompiling a whole program (and disabling reflection API) might perform so deep optimisation as needed here to automatically eliminate @volatile (gcj, maybe, by year 2030...)

We all expect that noone sane will be messing with the isDefined/value variables using reflection (if someone did - he/she is to blame his/herself only, of course). So by simply using the appropriate synchronized blocks, we declare "if someone plays dirty reflection games with the object internals they will be bitten as expected, while ligitimate service users will be enjoying optimal performance"; while having both @volatile and synchronized is a declaration "we will consciously harm performance of every program to ensure that people who play dirty reflection tricks are shielded from the race conditions", why.

Many thanks for getting this.
