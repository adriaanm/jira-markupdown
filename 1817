I'm puzzled. This should work ... can you send me an *absolutely* minimal project which illustrates the problem.

Nb. as of 2.7.4 that eclipse.org wiki page is wrong: you shouldn't have the Java builder in your .project, only the Scala builder (which will invoke the Java builder internally as necessary).
