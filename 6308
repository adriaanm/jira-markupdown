This heads into erasure and tries to find the lub of DenseMatrix[C] and DenseMatrix, apparently having lost the "A" during specialization.  The error message varies because adriaan made lublist do more things than it used to, but it was broken the same before.

The borked one doesn't even match its base type sequence.
