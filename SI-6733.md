The reflection API seems to provide no easy way to check for a symbol being private[this]. The only way I could find to do it is to explicitly check for hasFlag(LOCAL). It seems too important and fundamental to require direct access to flags like this.

Meanwhile, there is a method called isLocal that sounds like it is supposed to check for private[this]. The API doc for this method talks about access being limited to the enclosing object. That's not what the method actually returns, however. What the method returns is whether the symbol is defined within a term, as opposed to within a class.

It looks like the API method has had an accidental collision with a method that already exists in the Scala compiler. In my opinion, the definition in the compiler is a better match for the name "isLocal". Thus, add a new method to check for private[this], perhaps named isPrivateThis.
