It would be very useful in some instances to be able to do something like "import {Predef.any2StringAdd => _}" to hide predef implicits.
It works, with a slightly different syntax:

```scala
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _}

class Foo {
  (new Object) + ""
}
```

The output:

```scala
hiding.scala:4: error: value + is not a member of java.lang.Object
  (new Object) + ""
               ^
one error found
```
It works ONLY at the beginning of the file. In the example below, for instance, it won't compile with the first line uncommented, but will compile with it commented:

```scala
import Predef.{augmentString => _} // This works

object Unimport {
  val x = "x" * 5
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    import Predef.{augmentString => _} // Here it doesn't work
    // import Predef.{wrapString => _} // This line doesn't make any difference, 
    // here or at the beginning. It looks like a bug.
    
    Console.println("x" * 5)
  }
}
```
This is even more broken:

try to compile this:

```scala
import Predef.{intWrapper => _}

object Test {
  println("test")
}
```
(In r24904) Made -Yno-predef work again, also in the repl.  Fixed the "what
do I import" code to notice *root*.scala.Predef too.  Moved some of
the overly specialized, called-only-once functions in treeInfo inside
the one function which needs them.  References #1931.  No review.
This fix was floated last summer and works the same way with replating, viz, the predef imports are pulled to the top of the compilation unit.

Actually, for that last example, you have to:
```scala
import Predef.{ augmentString => _, wrapString => _, _ }
```
