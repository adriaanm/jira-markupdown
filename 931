That's good to hear.

What would happen if the compiler silently translated any code of the form

{code}
x match {
  case p1 => r1;
  case p2 => r2;
  ...
}
{code}

into

{code}
x match {
  case p1 => r1;
  case _ => x match {
    case p2 => r2;
    case _ => x match {
      ...
    }
  }
}

?

Would that destroy the performance of the match operation?  Maybe it would create lots of new function objects?
