{code}
object ScalaTest extends App {
  trait A {
    def a: String
    println(a)
  }
  class B extends A {
    override val a = "Overridden"
  }
  new B // prints "null"
}
{code}
This only happens when {{def}} or {{val}} is overridden with {{val}}.
This happens even if {{a}} is not abstract and has an implementation in {{A}} - both original and overridden values of {{a}} are ignored and {{null}} is printed instead.

In my understanding this should work or at least cause some kind of compilation warning/error.
I would agree, but this also happens when method is NOT abstract. You think that's not a bug either?
E.g.
{code}
  class A {
    def a: String = "a"
    println(a)
  }
  class B extends A {
    override val a = "Overridden"
  }
  new B // Prints "null" anyway
{code}
If you have an implementation for `a` in the superclass and it is overriden in the subclass, the superclass impl will only be called if the overriding impl calls `super.a`.

{code}
class C  { val x: T = y  }
{code}

is a sugar for:

{code}
class C { 
 def this() { _x = y }
 <field> _x: T = null;
  def x: T = _x;
}
{code}

We are discussing the possibility of a lint tool for Scala. That could do a whole-program analysis and detect some of these problems. But the compiler can't do this reliably, as it needs to be able to compiler the sub- and super-classes independentally.
Not sure how is this related, since we're making calls from the superclass, not from the subclass.
Please note that this bug happens even when {{a}} is decalred in a superclass as a method, not as a field.
