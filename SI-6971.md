Case 1:
```scala
def foo(x: _, y: Int) = macro impl
def impl(c: Context)(x: c.Tree, y: c.Tree) = ...
```

Case 2:
```scala
def bar(x: _) = macro impl
def impl(c: Context)(x: c.Expr[Int]) = ...
```

In both of these cases, typer could do its best to provide better-than-nothing type-safety guarantees. This of course entails various type inference stuff, which would be too much of an effort now.
