```scala
$ cat unused.scala
object Unused {
  val optTup = Some((1, 2))

  for {
    tup <- optTup
    (num1, num2) = tup
  } yield (num1 + num2)
}
$ scalac -Ywarn-unused unused.scala

We removed this option from -Xlint in #7712 because, as you have found, it is somewhat incomplete.
One way to look at it is that the warning is there to keep you from doing something unintentional.

The warning is not spurious, in that the for comprehension desugars into an extra packaging step; it's the for comprehension equivalent of autoboxing.

See the part where he goes, "Wait, really?"  The locals in the yield block are unused.

http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#for-comprehensions-and-for-loops

Intended:
```scala
  for {
    tup <- optTup
  } yield {
    val (num1, num2) = tup
    (num1 + num2)
  }
```
But what if I want to write the something like this? Such code throws warning too.
```scala
  for {
    tup1 <- optTup
    (num1, num2) = tup1
    tup2 <- fn(num2, num1)
  } yield {
    tup2 // or anything else
  }
```

Is it really unintended?
Here is another example that could benefit from more efficient handling of intermediate results.

Because the unused extraction result `i` is not bundled in the tupling step, the extractor is invoked three times.

```scala
scala> for (s <- List("ab","abc") ; X(i) = s if i > 2) yield i // show
[snip]
      val res0 = List("ab", "abc").map(((s) => {
        <synthetic> <artifact> private[this] val x$2 = s: @scala.unchecked match {
          case (x$1 @ X((i @ _))) => scala.Tuple2(x$1, i)
        };
        val x$1 = x$2._1;
        val i = x$2._2;
        scala.Tuple2(s, x$1)
      })).withFilter(((x$3) => x$3: @scala.unchecked match {
        case scala.Tuple2((s @ _), X((i @ _))) => i > 2
      })).map(((x$4) => x$4: @scala.unchecked match {
        case scala.Tuple2((s @ _), X((i @ _))) => i
      }))
    }
  }
}
```
The PR tags the binds as if they were `(i @ *, j @ *) = t` which is the way to disable the warning in source.
