Some java classes can work on !CharSequences instead of just Strings (in particular java.util.regex._).  So it would be convenient if compat.!StringBuilder implemented !CharSequence just as java.util.{!StringBuilder,!StringBuffer} do so I don't have to toString.

The only method missing is subSequence, which would just be:
```scala
  def subSequence(i: Int, j: Int): CharSequence = self.subSequence(i, j)
```

While you have it open, you might consider implementing !StringBuilder using java's !StringBuilder instead of !StringBuffer: java.util.!StringBuilder doesn't have the synchronization overhead of !StringBuffer.
