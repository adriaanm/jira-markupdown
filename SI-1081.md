The following shows that working with *Iterable.projection.map* leads to inconsistent behavior:

```scala
object Main extends Application
{
  class Dynamic(initial : Int)
  {
    var value = initial
    
    override def toString() = value.toString()
    override def hashCode() = 7*value.hashCode() + 13    
  }
  
  def foo ( it : Iterable[Int] ) = 
  {
    for(e <- it.projection) yield new Dynamic(e)
  }
    
  def bar ( it : Iterable[Dynamic] ) = for(e <- it) 
  {
    e.value += 1
  }

    
  val set = foo ( collection.immutable.Set(1,2,3) )
  bar ( set )
  print("Set: " )
  for ( e <- set ) print ( e + " " ) // 1,2,3
  println()

  val array = foo ( Array(1,2,3) ) // 1,2,3
  bar ( array )
  println ( array.toString )  
  
  val list = foo ( List(1,2,3) ) // 2,3,4
  bar ( list )
  println ( list.toString )  
  
  /*
  val listStream = List(1,2,3).toStream.map { new Dynamic(_) }
  bar ( listStream )
  println ( listStream.toString )

  val arraySstream = Array(1,2,3).toStream.map { new Dynamic(_) }
  bar ( arraySstream )
  println ( arraySstream.toString )
  */
}
```

I understand that calling the function passed to _map_ needs to be called each time evaluating the newly created _Iterable_ since the _Array_-elements could have been changed. So I propose doing the same with _List_ and _Stream_ although the are immutable. Especially because _collection.immutable.Set_ already behaves this way!
I agree that for a *Stream* implementing this type of behavior is super inefficient and it makes no sense to do so.

However, with different behavioral implementation for such a standard method one cannot safely program with the base classes (*Iterable*,*Collection*,*Seq*,..) anymore since the implementations and their differences are unknown. However, this is what abstracting / object oriented programming is all about!


How about keeping *Projection.map* strict, which means changing the *{Array,Set,..}.projection* implementation. Then updates on the elements would not be reflected anymore, only changes to themself (as with *List*/*Stream*). This also seems more reasonable as *Array.toStream().map* does exactly that and is what I would expect from _Array.projection.map'.

I would go even further: Remove the *Projection* classes and *projection* methods from *Iterable* and all its derications. Create wrapper classes for mutable collections instead, like *ProjectedArray* (compare Rich..) ) , which reflect all *updates*. Note: there is no need for it with immutable ones anyway. The current *Projection* stuff only makes the standard library unnecessary complicated!
I think the only possible way is to leave Projection is it is. It is an under-speicifed abstraction, which should be used only for operations that are side-effect free.

So basically whenever your method parameter is an _Iterable_, you cannot have side-effect on its elements(*). The only secure way would be to use a _match_/_instanceOf_[Projection] call, then cast and use _force_ - in the beginning of EVERY such method, because _Projection_ extends _Iteration_!

**Therefore under-specified abstraction are bad object-oriented design.**

This could be somehow fixed or at least improved by adding a method *forceIfProjection* to *Iterable*

However, what makes is worse is that *Stream.map* behaves like a mix of the *Iterable* and *Projection* version: 
It is non-strict in the way that the code passed to *map*/*foreach*/.. is not called for all elements immediately. However it ignores that elements might NOT be immutable and therefore calls the passed code only once per elements, which is of course always fine with a strict *Iterable*.


I really like Scala because of the functional concepts beside OO and the general language design! Therefore hate to say it, but such a bad object-oriented design of the standard library not being fixed forces me to give up on Scala :-(


(*) unsafe accordingly to you, because *it* could be a *Projection* and therefore the *map* behavior is ambiguous due to the under-specified abstraction:(_Array.Projection_+_Set.Projection_, *Stream*):
```scala
def foo[A] ( it : Iterable[A] ) 
{
... code with side-effect(s) on the elements of it
... e.g.: for ( it <- elem ) it.update(...)
}
```
side note: actually I would be great if the following would be allowed in Scala:

```scala
class Array[A]
{
   def projection : RandomAccessSeq [ => A ] = ..
}
```

because this is what it is.

**Note: Of course [=>] would be limited to [+A]!**


If the same would be applied to *List*:

```scala
class List[+A]
{
   def projection : Stream [ => A ] = ..
}
```

It would fix the issue[1009 http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1099] as side-effect.

Of course *List.toStream* should be left as is for performance reasons!
+1 on this issue.

I've encountered another issue with projection+map:  it behaves differently depending on whether the underlying iterable is a List or something else.  Specifically, given something like this:

someIterable.projection.map(_ * x).find(_ == y)

the iterable produced by List.projection always calls map once more than necessary.  For example, if the find matches the first element of the List, the projection will still invoke map on the second element.

The problem is the same as the one articulated by gestalt:  If the mapping function has side effects or (more likely) is simply time-consuming, then using projection is impractical unless the application knows that the iterable is not a List.

Furthermore the "always call the map function once more than necessary" behavior of List.projection.map is counterintuitive and is **never** the behavior that the application expects or wants, even if the application can tolerate it.
