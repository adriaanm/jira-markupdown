=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===
{code}
scala> def id[A](as: A*) = as
id: [A](as: A*)A*

scala> id[Int] _
res12: (Int*) => Int* = <function1>

scala> res12(1) 
res13: Int* = WrappedArray(1)

scala> res12(Nil :_*)
res14: Int* = List()
{code} 


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

According to the spec:

"4.6.2 Repeated Parameters

The last value parameter of a parameter section may be suffixed by “*”, e.g. `(..., x:T*).` The type of such a repeated parameter inside the method is then the	sequence	type	`scala.Seq[T]`"

Firstly, the inferred type of `ids` should be `Seq[A]`.

Secondly, the eta expansion of `ids[Int] _` should result in `(Seq[Int]) => Seq[Int])`

=== What do you see instead? ===

The internal type of the repeated parameter leaks out; and, via eta expansion, results  in a `Function1` with `def apply(v1: T*)`.

=== Additional information ===

Such behaviour was explicitly excluded in SI-3652 and SI-3180.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1

The types do become what they ought to be, but it doesn't happen until uncurry, after which the types have already been pickled with A* in there.  (The repl shows the types right after typer.) Not sure how to address.

Okay, that explains the behaviour.

There is some commented out code in the typechecker relevant to this problem. Looks like the Eta expansion used to prevented:

As pf r12607, this check was commented out. The commit comment isn't illuminating -- SI-1269 is a `worksforme` and a cursory search over the interwebs doesn't reveal the origin or intention of (Stephan?) Kolstov's patch.

For the benefit of future ticket readers, here's the problem without the REPL. If scalac followed the letter of the spec, `f(1)` would not be allowed.

object test1 {
  def id[A](as: A*) = as
  val f = id[Int] _
}

object test2 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
     val f = test1.f
     f(1)
     f(Nil: _*)
  }

    };
    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      val f: (Int*) => Int* = test1.f;
      f.apply(1);
      {
        f.apply((immutable.this.Nil: _*));
        ()
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}

I think adapt should turn repeated paramtypes into the corresponding type after uncurry since the spec says 'The type of such a repeated parameter inside the method is then the sequence type scala.Seq[T]'. 

I don't know what to derive from this concerning the type of the argument of the method and its eta-expansion since these are *outside* of the method, and the spec fragment talks about *inside* the method.

Tip from a seasoned, weathered, barely hanging on scala archaeologist: if the ticket number doesn't make any sense odds are it's in the pre-trac bug database, which is archived online.  Here is SI-1269.

http://www.scala-lang.org/sites/default/files/aladdin/displayItem.do%3Fid=1269.html

It was opened 8/8/07 and the commit is 8/21/07 and logic takes us the rest of the way.
I should never have allowed that patch at the time. I had a bad feeling about it, because it was checked in without changing the spec. I have since then become much stricter in that respect. The problem now is that we have to make illegal some code that worked before. That's always a mine field. You never know what will blow up when you do that.
 
I'll change the inferred result type. But somebody else needs to follow up on the eta expansion, or we leave it as a won't fix. I simply do not have the bandwidth anymore to follow breakages in user code which will inevitably happen when we do this.

See SI-2210 for another manifestation.
And see SI-3229 for yet another.
I (locally) fixed the inferred type and the eta-expansion, as far as I know.  Anyone want to suggest what I've overlooked, given the following transcript?

{noformat}
scala> def id[A](as: A*) = as
id: [A](as: A*)Seq[A]

scala> id[Int] _
res0: Seq[Int] => Seq[Int] = <function1>
{noformat}

(extempore in [r25227|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25227]) Modified return type inference not to allow T* to leak from varargs
methods. Since I don't know what is supposed to be done about eta
expansion of these methods, I left the behavior as it was (except the
return type) and a boolean val in Types to change it.

  def id[T](xs: T*) = xs
  etaExpandKeepsStar = true   // (id[Int] _) is Int* => Seq[Int]
  etaExpandKeepsStar = false  // (id[Int] _) is Seq[Int] => Seq[Int]

References #4176, leaving open pending resolution of eta expansion.
Review by odersky.
(extempore in [r25809|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25809]) Flipped varargs eta-expansion behavior.

(T*)U now eta-expands to Seq[T] => U, not T* => U.  There is a
transition command line switch to get the old behavior for any who
may have relied upon it:

  -Yeta-expand-keeps-star

Closes SI-4176, no review.
