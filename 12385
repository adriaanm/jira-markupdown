Not sure what you mean by "frame-based navigation", but to elaborate on the current design-choices (for posterity): the old (<=2.11) version of scaladoc was structured like this:
```html
<html>
    <div id="sidebar">
        <!-- all the top-level entities here -->
    </div>
    <div id="main-content">
        <!-- right pane, containing the current entity, controlled via javascript magic -->
        <iframe src="path/to/entity.scala"/>
    </div>
</html>
```

This was bad for a number of reasons, main reason being navigation and history would require some form of unique implementation instead of using standard js-functions, compatibility between browsers had to be dealt with yadayadayada.

The 2.12 version generates a page for each entity and the navigation between them is standard browser navigation. This means that you would here link to an html-file and then referencing an anchor on said site e.g:
```html
../path/to/Entity.html#member
```

Instead of a having a special syntax like:
```html
/index.html#path.to.Entity@function
```

This coupled with the new search feature allows us to have improved navigation implemented in a standard way - was this perhaps the point of a "frame-based" navigation?
