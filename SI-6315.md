This should not be done.  Something has to be renamed.

The TIMEOUT.class is located in the scala-actors.jar and Timeout.class is located in the scala-actors-migration.jar. Is this still the problem?

If yes, the TIMEOUT is used in Scala actors so it can not be renamed. The Timeout is part of the actor migration and should be called Timeout so the users could smoothly move to Akka. 

However, Timeout is rarely used through the public interface so we can do all accesses to Timeout through the Timeout object and then rename the Timeout class to something else (e.g. AkkaTimeout). This should not affect the migration much since it would be used through the Timeout object methods.

This is still the problem, yes.  It doesn't matter that they're in separate jars; they are both on the standard classpath.  If you explode the jars they will ovewrite one another on a case-insensitive filesystem.  The are numerous situations where this has a chance of biting people; there's no reason to do it.  In fact splitting the package across multiple jars breaks OSGI, as someone noted elsewhere.

I don't think you need to work that hard.  I can manage it from the repl.

Here is the second part. One day we can put it into the build workflow.

{code}
val jars = (sys.props("java.class.path") split ':').toList

val jarPackages = jars.map(j => j.toString.drop(j.toString.lastIndexOf("/") + 1)).
  zip(jars.map(p =>
    new scala.tools.nsc.io.Jar(p).iterator.
    map(_.toString).
    filter(_.endsWith(".class")).
    map(s => s.take(s.lastIndexOf("/"))).toSet)
  ).toSet

jarPackages.foreach {case (n1, j) => 
  j foreach {p =>
    jarPackages filterNot(_._2 == j) foreach { case (n2, jj) =>
      if (jj.contains(p)) println(s"($p from $n1) duplicated in $n2")
    }
  }
}
{code}

Output is: 
(scala/tools/nsc/io from scala-compiler.jar) duplicated in scala-reflect.jar

Don't know if this is a problem for OSGI?
Partest doesn't have all the jars on the classpath; at least, the one you guys are using doesn't.  (Mine does.) it is a problem/bug that scala.tools.nsc.io is split across jars, one I raised already: it's SI-6305.
