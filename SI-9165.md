Welcome to Scala version 2.11.5 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_31).

scala>               Region.US_WEST_1
res0: awscala.Region = us-west-1

scala>               Region.US_WEST_1
<console>:14: error: value US_WEST_1 is not a member of object awscala.Region
                            Region.US_WEST_1
                                   ^
```

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.5"
libraryDependencies +=  "com.github.seratch" %% "awscala" % "0.4.4"
initialCommands in console := "import awscala._, s3._"
```

```scala
sbt.version = 0.13.8-M3
```
Perhaps it's confused because there is a type alias in the package object. Is that supported?

Note that Region extends Any, not AnyRef.
Such types can participate in value classes, but instances
cannot appear in singleton types or in reference comparisons.

The ticket it duplicates exactly is not closed. The REPL compiler stays resident in order to be useful, so it is like those characters on tv who have lived for two hundred years and see things the rest of us do not. There's also forget mode, `:reset -X`.
