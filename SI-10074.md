Trying to compile specified file results an error:
[error] The argument types of an anonymous function must be fully known. (SLS 8.5)
[error] Expected type was: ?
[error]   a.overloadedF[Int]{

If you omit type parameter in method invocation or remove second overloaded function, everything works fine.
minimized:

```scala
object A {
  f[Int]{case _ => 1}
  def f[T](f: Any => T) = ()
  def f[T](f: Any => T, v: Int) = ()
}
```
If there's a bug here, is it that the version *with* the explicit type *does* compile, or is it that the version *without* the explicit type *doesn't* compile? I'd need to go over SLS 6.26 with a fine-tooth comb (along with SLS 8.5 which is mentioned in the error).
I expected the shape test to allow arg typed with expected type, as if not overloaded.

But the behavior has history on its side.

Looks like an oversight in the implementation to me. `Typer::preSelectOverloaded` is responsible for filtering out alternatives based on arity (also based on the "shape type" of function literal arguments), but this is bypassed in this case.

```scala
      def preSelectOverloaded(fun: Tree): Tree = {
        if (fun.hasSymbolField && fun.symbol.isOverloaded) {

```

We have:

```
fun = A.this.f[Int] / TypeApply(Select(...., f), TypeTree(Int))
fun.hasSymbolField = false
fun.tpe = OverloadedType((f: Any => Int, v: Int)Unit <and> (f: Any => Int)Unit)
fun.fun.symbol.info = [T](f: Any => T, v: Int)Unit <and> (f: Any => T)Unit
```

After filtering, we can end up with a new symbol: either a single method symbol, or a new overloaded symbol with fewer alternatives. This needs to be assigned back to the tree `fun`. We can't just assign

The fix is conceptually easy enough ("generalize that code a little!") but there are a lot of details to line up. I took a hacky attempt at it : https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.12.x...retronym:ticket/10074?expand=1

but I'm not planning to pursue this right now.
I don't know the specifics if this is the same place in code or not, but overloading with curried params results the same problem, regardless of using or omitting type parameter... 
```scala
object A{

  fun[Int]{
    case _ => 1
  }

  def fun[T](f: PartialFunction[Any, T]): T = {
    f(1)
  }

  def fun[T](v: Int)(f: PartialFunction[Any, T]) = {
    f(v)
  }

}
```
