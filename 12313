If the improved error messages only affect negatively the error scenario, I think we all agree that it is worth it. My question was if it was worth it to do extra work *even in the success scenario* just to provide better error messages (e.g. to show the size of the collection), and I agree with @Ichoran on that regard.

@Ichoran, is there an easy way I can check if methods are able of being JIT-inlined? If not, is there some golden rule to that?
