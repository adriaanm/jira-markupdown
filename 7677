OK, thanks.  Sorry for the noise.  I'm still blushing for even mentioning it.

I did try to search on Jira first, just for the record.

I found "SI-363 When an object and a class are defined with the same name, the object's main method is not found."

Well, I also searched with "case-sensitive" but not "case-insensitive."  As a keyword, not a search flag.

I promise to reboot into Linux later this evening; not now, it's almost preschool pickup time.
