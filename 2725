I am no longer sure if this is really a bug due to Unicode!

I guess my problem was that my case classes contained variable input parameters, like:
{code}
case class Ï€(steps: Expr*)
{code}

I substituted all {{Expr*}} by {{List[Expr]}} and it works fine now.  Unfortunately beforehand I also substituted all unicode characters by ascii characters.  So I can no longer tell if this issue is related to unicode characters or to variable input parameters.

If you can tell that this issue is not related to {{Expr*}}, I'll set up a little code snippet to reconstruct the issue discussed here.
