It happened in r21106:

{code}
trait Actor ... {
  ...
  override def start(): Actor = synchronized {
	...
{code}

was changed to 

{code}
trait Actor ... {
  ...
  override def start(): Actor = synchronized {
    if (_state == Actor.State.New) {
	...
{code}

and similar changes happened in Reactor.

It's a huge commit. These particular change were done in the process of making {{start()}}
idempotent, which is a good thing, of course. Still, actors should be restartable,
so start should support the case {{_state == Actor.State.Terminated}},
too.

Question is, should the mesage queue be cleared on restart? How do Akka
and Lift actors handle this on restart?
