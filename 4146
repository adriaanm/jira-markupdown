It happened in r21106:
```scala
trait Actor ... {
  ...
  override def start(): Actor = synchronized {
	...
```

was changed to 
```scala
trait Actor ... {
  ...
  override def start(): Actor = synchronized {
    if (_state == Actor.State.New) {
	...
```

and similar changes happened in Reactor.

It's a huge commit. These particular change were done in the process of making `start()`
idempotent, which is a good thing, of course. Still, actors should be restartable,
so start should support the case `_state == Actor.State.Terminated`,
too.

Question is, should the mesage queue be cleared on restart? How do Akka
and Lift actors handle this on restart?
