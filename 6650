I have to run, but the only code ant strap.done could find that's affected by my patch is in GenTypes. I had to turn it into:
```scala
      case tpe : NoType.type =>
        reifyMirrorObject(tpe)
      case tpe : NoPrefix.type =>
        reifyMirrorObject(tpe)
```

Proposed patch: https://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commits/ticket-5024

I'm not sure we should do this in 2.10.1, but slightly in favor.
