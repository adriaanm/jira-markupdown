We discussed this with Martin just now and he agreed unhesitatingly that underscores should be allowed, just like in SLS 1.1. (We didn't delve into why he seemed to say otherwise in the SLIP video.)

So, we should just change what the string interpolation SIP says about it, at http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/string-interpolation.html.

But, I see that SIP-11 is actually a Google Docs document owned by Martin, so there's no way to change it via pull request. (http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html exists, but it's less technical and doesn't have wording covering the issue.)

In some theoretical future, the SIP would just be a historical document that doesn't matter anymore because it was merged into the spec, but that hasn't been happening, so I guess I'll write Martin and ask for edit rights.

@som-snytt Any questions?
