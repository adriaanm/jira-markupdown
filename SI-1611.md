Given

{code}
class Gen
{
    def add(name: String) = {
        println("Adding " + name)
        new {
            def bind(pattern: String) = { 
                println("Binding " + pattern + " to " + name)
                this
            }
        }
    }
}
{code}

The calling code

{code}
val gen = new Gen()
gen.add("a")
gen.add("b").bind("1")
{code}

Should output

{code}
Adding a
Adding b
Binding 1 to b
{code}

Instead the result is

{code}
Adding a
Adding b
Adding b
Binding 1 to b
{code}

Disassembly of calling code verifies that multiple calls to gen.add("b") are emitted, specifically 2**n calls to add() where n = number of chained calls to bind().


I think this one's for Gilles. As discussed on the list, it only happens for structural types.
