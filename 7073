A sequence of bash commands creating and running a small test case. 
```scala
echo "public class A { public B b; }" > A.java
echo "public class B { public C c; }" > B.java
echo "public class C { }" > C.java
echo class A_scala { var b:B = _ }  > A.scala # only to avoid name .class file name confusion
```
```scala
javac *.java
scalac A.scala
```

Every thing works fine so far.
```scala
rm C.class
rm A.class
```

Now comes the interesting part:
```scala
javac A.java
ls
```

As you can see, Java compiles just fine.
```scala
scalac A.scala
```

This will cause

{panel}
error: error while loading B, Missing dependency 'class C', required by ./B.class
one error found
{panel}

Scalac seems to be trying to load dependencies of B, despite B being already compiled.
