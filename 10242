Problem here is that if you add `this.synchronized` to `getOrElseUpdate`, you suddenly have to add it around all other methods in `TrieMap`.

Unless carefully designed tricks are employed (such as the locked Lazy node described earlier), introducing a single lock to a lock-free data structure operation, usually pollutes all other operations with the need for locking :/
