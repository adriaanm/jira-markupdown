Seems you can't define a value class's value as implicit:

```scala
class IntW(implicit val n: Int) extends AnyVal
```

---

```scala
Foo.scala:1: error: value class may not be a member of another class
class Foo(implicit val n: Int) extends AnyVal
      ^
one error found
```

The use of Int here as an implicit class is just for reproduction purpose, it wouldn't be wise to do so.

The current workaround is to drop the implicit and define an implicit method:

```scala
class IntW(val n: Int) extends AnyVal {
  private implicit def implicitInt: Int = n 
}
```
