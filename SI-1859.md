Both ASM and Eclipse complain about the generics signature of SymbolTable.trackSetInfo.  If you give Eclipse these two lines of code:
```scala
scala.tools.nsc.Interpreter interp = null;
interp.compiler().trackSetInfo(null, null);
```

Eclipse gives this message:
<T:Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Names;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Symbols;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Types;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Scopes;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Definitions;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Constants;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/BaseTypeSeqs;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/InfoTransformers;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/StdNames;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/AnnotationInfos;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/AnnotationCheckers;Lscala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees;Lscala/ScalaObject.Symbol;>(TT;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Names;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Symbols;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Types;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Scopes;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Definitions;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Constants;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/BaseTypeSeqs;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/InfoTransformers;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/StdNames;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/AnnotationInfos;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/AnnotationCheckers;Lscala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees;Lscala/ScalaObject.Type;)TT;


ASM says something similar.  Looking into the generics string, it looks like T is being given a strange upper bound.  Its upper bound should be Symbols.Symbol.  It looks like the "Symbols" part of this is messed up.

In addition to  fixing this particular bug, it would be helpful if someone can run ASM class file decodes across the rest of scala-compiler.jar and scala-library.jar.

Since it was assigned to me (although that might have been accidental) I looked at it yesterday, and I was able to reproduce it as well, though it wasn't easy.  I couldn't reproduce it in eclipse, but then I can never reproduce anything in eclipse.  I eventually reproduced it with javac (had to be 1.6 on OSX to get that error.)

What I failed to do was find an automated way to test the validity of the generics signatures throughout all the class files.  I would really like to find a static tool which I can run on all the classfiles for info, but so far I have had to write code which invokes trackSetInfo in order to discover that the generics signature is wrong.

Proguard chokes on what might be a related issue - there is an open bug from seth tissue here:

  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2725052&group_id=54750&atid=474704
Since the author's reply is not too prominent in the bug report, here is why I said they might be related:
```scala
Thanks for the report. ProGuard trips on the following Signature
attribute:

<t::Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/util/parsing/ast/AbstractSyntax;
Lscala/util/parsing/ast/Mappable;
Lscala/ScalaObject.NameElement;>(Tt;)Ljava/lang/Object;
Lscala/util/parsing/ast/AbstractSyntax;
Lscala/util/parsing/ast/Mappable;Lscala/ScalaObject.Mappable<Tt;>;

I would expect colons inbetween the initial ClassBound and InterfaceBounds
of type 't'. Can you check if the signature is correct?
```
Thanks for the comments. I was indeed not cc'ed on them. This is weird. When the signature gets generated everything seems OK. So, what do you use to find out what signature ends up in the classfile? javap only give sthe erased types.
javap doesn't print them, as strange as that is.  ASM includes sample utilities that can take apart and print out the generics info.

The ProGuard bug does looks closely related.  In fact, the IndexOutOfBounds error message looks suspiciously like an ASM complaint.
This is more involved and annoying to figure out than I'd thought, but when all is said and done I will have written verification tools which will increase the amount of info we have about classfiles.

Here's a fun fact: if you call .getGenericParameterTypes on trackSetInfo from the borked classfile, the JVM will chug away until it runs out of memory.
```scala
"Exception Catcher Thread" prio=10 tid=0x01001770 nid=0x80ac00 runnable 
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
	at java.util.ArrayList.<init>(ArrayList.java:113)
```
Here's where:
```scala
	at java.lang.System.arraycopy(Native Method)
	at java.util.ArrayList.toArray(ArrayList.java:304)
	at sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser.parseZeroOrMoreBounds(SignatureParser.java:418)
	at sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser.parseFormalTypeParameter(SignatureParser.java:199)
	at sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser.parseFormalTypeParameters(SignatureParser.java:190)
	at sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser.parseZeroOrMoreFormalTypeParameters(SignatureParser.java:177)
	at sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser.parseMethodTypeSignature(SignatureParser.java:436)
	at sun.reflect.generics.parser.SignatureParser.parseMethodSig(SignatureParser.java:141)
```
Clearly scalac is generating bad signatures and the JVM (and most of the rest of the world) is less than robust in dealing with them.
The signatures were broken in r17396.  Until then trackSetInfo's signature looked like this:
```scala
<T:Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Symbols$$Symbol;>(TT;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Types$$Type;)TT;
```
It looks like info has to be used more carefully? I'm adding iulian to the cc: since he has the best chance of knowing how to remedy this in short order.
Also, I managed the surprisingly difficult task of verifying the signatures through direct inspection, or at least some of them -- but it's promising that it's all of them because only three malformed signatures were identified among the compiler classes, and one was trackSetInfo.  (There were also some exceptions thrown, I haven't looked into those yet.) The other two:
```scala
Trees.scala
public abstract resetAttrs	(Lscala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees$$Tree;)Lscala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees$$Tree;
signature: <A:Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/ScalaObject.Tree;>(TA;)TA;

ModelExtractor.scala
public abstract sort	(Lscala/Iterable;)Lscala/Iterable;
signature: <E:Ljava/lang/Object;Lscala/ScalaObject.Entity;>(Lscala/Iterable<TE;>;)Lscala/Iterable<TE;>;
```
This information comes by way of javassist's javassist.tools.Dump.
The exceptions are being thrown in the face of an endless variety of bad signatures.  I think they all have the same form where the inner class is dotted after some overcomplicated type, but possibly not.  Some examples:
```scala
signature: (Lscala/BufferedIterator$$PutBack<TA;>.$$anonfun$$flushFrom$$1;)V
signature: (Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>;TA;TB;Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Tree<TB;>;Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Tree<TB;>;)V
signature: (Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.NonEmpty<TB;>;)V
signature: (Lscala/collection/jcl/MutableIterable<TA;>.$$anonfun$$retainAll$$1;)V
```
```scala
java -cp /local/lib/java/javassist.jar javassist.tools.Dump /scala/trunk/build/quick/classes/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/symtab/SymbolTable.class
```
The output will have "syntax error" in it on the non-crashing bad signatures, or throw an exception on the crashy ones.  I just ran that command line on every classfile under quick and picked through the output.

I'm writing a much nicer tool as we speak, but I may not get much more done today or this weekend as I have my kids to myself.
