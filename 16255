scalac drops an empty argument to -cp, using the next argument instead.  For example, in the following command line, it uses A.scala as the classpath and only B.scala is a source file.

{code}
scalac -cp "" A.scala B.scala
{code}

You can verify this by creating A.scala and B.scala as follows:

A.scala
{code}
class A
{code}

B.scala
{code}
class B extends A
{code}

A won't be found when scalac compiles B.  This is a regression from 2.8.1
