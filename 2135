> While looking into scala/bug#3616, I noticed that the fix for this bug (in r21235) maintains a strong reference to every user-defined Enumeration.  This is quite bad because as long as there are strong references to Scala library classes, user classes will not be garbage collected.

How do you think we should address this? Would it be enough to use weak references and recreate the enum values if they're collected? It's not entirely clear to me how everything fits together.
