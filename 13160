I think you'd market this as a feature, but it is extremely counter-intuitive: one cannot insert closing parens that have not been open! Moreover, closing an 'extra' parenthesis will just eat the last seen closing parenthesis, and and move it to the cursor. That's really not what you want (for me it happened to move a closing paren from a parameter list in a primary constructor and move it down a few methods). Parenthesis should not be treated special. I am fine with having a screen full of red underlines for a few keystrokes, but it's *not* funny to search 10 minutes for a syntax error non-locally connected to the place I edit.
