Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to make any difference on Windows 7.

BTW, on Mac OS X adding that option makes things worse: the REPL still executes the expressions from the file, but doesn't echo them and goes into an infinite prompt-printing loop at the end of the file.
