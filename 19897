The spec says:
```scala
id ::= plainid | ‘`’ stringLiteral ‘`’
```
That seems fine.  But what is {{stringLiteral}}?
Section 1.3.5 says
```scala
stringLiteral  ::=  ‘"’ {stringElement} ‘"’
```
This seems wrong because I don't need double quotes to make a back-quoted identifier.
```scala
stringLiteral   ::=  ‘"""’ multiLineChars ‘"""’
```
seems wrong for the same reason.

What is a {{stringLiteral}}?

Side question: which escape characters are allowed in the identifier string literal?  Because it's some, but apparently not `\``

Thanks!
