(In r24296) Made the unification algorithm for specialization stricter when checking if a specialized member symbol conforms to a type application.

In particular, whereas the `strict` unification mode is concerned:
- when both types are typerefs, unification checks whether they have the same number of type args, then unifies type args
- when both types are method types, unification checks whether they have the same number of arguments, then unifies argument types and return types
- when both types are poly types, -- || --
- when unifying multiple types, strict mode will ensure there aren't any overlapping mappings.

Let's hope this fixes and closes SI-4257.
