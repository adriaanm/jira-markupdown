RegexParser appears to eat whitespace only **before** a parse object, not after, so for example:

def root = rep(a | b)

will not work on a file that ends with whitespace, but requires:

def root = rep(a | b) ~ ""

you can reproduce this (and see the workaround) in configgy, hosted on github, in this file: ... er, well github is down right now, but it's in the file net.lag.configgy.!ConfigParser.scala, line 34.
