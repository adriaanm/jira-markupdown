Martin says this should not compile, that y should not be able to be given a type-incompatible implementation.  I'm opening the ticket so it isn't forgotten.
```scala
class Q {
  private var x: Int = 0
  private[Q] var y: Int = 0
}                                                                               
class QQ extends Q {
  var x: String = "abc"
  var y: String = "abc"
}  
```
I'm confused as to why this should be a type error. In 5.2 of the spec, we have:

The modifier can be *qualified* with an identifier C (e.g.
`private[C]`) that must denote a class or package
enclosing the definition.  Members labeled with such a modifier are
accessible respectively only from code inside the package C or only
from code inside the class C and its companion module
(ï¿½5.4). Such members are also inherited only from
templates inside C.
