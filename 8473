1) I agree with you that {{z}} should be a by-name parameter. This would help in the sense that values of type `B` would no longer be required to be immutable. Making it a by-name parameter should be possible in a source-compatible way, I believe.

2) I disagree with you that "the method is flawed in design". The statement "z must be the zero element for the comb op" is a precondition on the method parameter which is, unfortunately, not expressible in the type system - and that is not the only example of such a method. Method {{reduce}} must have an associative reduction operator, otherwise the results are nondeterministic. Methods other than {{next}} and {{hasNext}} on the {{Iterator}} can be called only once, otherwise the results are undefined. Method {{find}} takes a predicate, which should not be {{null}}.
Methods for which preconditions are expressed in the documentation (which says that if these are not met, the results are undefined) are not "flawed in design".
