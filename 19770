The following snippet should produce a warning that CC(_, B2) isn't matched.
```scala
  sealed abstract class TA
  sealed abstract class TB extends TA
  case object B extends TB
  case object B2 extends TB

  case class CC(i: Int, tb: TB)

  // Should warn that CC(_, B2) isn't matched
  val test: CC => Unit = {
    case CC(_, B) => ()
  }
```
