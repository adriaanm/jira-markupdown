I have no idea what is triggering this, but the method "flatten" is not being displayed on collections. Whether there are other methods that are missing or not I don't know.
What is this doing in `GenericTraversableTemplate` then?

```scala
  def flatten[B](implicit asTraversable: A => /*<:<!!!*/ GenTraversableOnce[B]): CC[B] = {                      
    val b = genericBuilder[B]                                                                                   
    for (xs <- sequential)                                                                                      
      b ++= asTraversable(xs).seq                                                                               
    b.result                                                                                                    
  }   
```

The method does show up looking the ScalaDoc for it too, but if I click on `List` in the list of subclasses and search again, it has disappeared.

And it does show up on 2.9.1, where scaladoc hasn't gone through the use case changes.
I got suckered there by a) the fact that flatten used to be external and b) the comment at the top of GenericTraversableTemplate says
```scala
A template class for companion objects of ``regular`` collection classes
```
You'd think I'd know better than to believe documentation (not to mention it should be hard for me to forget what GenericTraversableTemplate does) but some days are like that.
Okay, here's the explanation why it doesn't appear: The function is defined in {{GenericTraversableTemplate}} and redefined with {{@bridge}} in {{Traversable}}. In {{scala.collection.immutable.List}}'s linearization, {{Traversable}} comes before {{GenericTraversableTemplate}}, thus making the {{method flatten}} symbol bridge-annotated and filtered out by Scaladoc. 

One idea on how to fix that is to filter out `@bridge` methods ONLY if there are other methods with the same name in the template. What do you think of that?
I attached a log that shows the functions that were disappearing because they were overridden by `@bridge` methods. I will only filter the bridge methods that don't override normal methods.
Fixed in [d078b589](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/d078b58961014c5eaa7540c4cec733679dc8965c).
