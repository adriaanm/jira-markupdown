In Regex the unapplySeq method uses m.matches to determine if the regex should extract matching groups.  This should instead use m.find(0).

Using m.matches acts as if the pattern were implicitly anchored.  Consider

val Re = """(x)""".r
val Re(x) = "xyz"
val Re(y) = "x"

When using a regular expression a user can state explicitly that they want anchoring and the Regex library should not mandate that decision.  As an aside this often leads to people surrounding their patterns with ".*PTRN.*" which can turn a nice fast pattern into one with heavy backtracking.  See Mastering Regular Expressions by Friedl for details.
Gotta love Jira.  That should read

{noformat}
val Re = """(x)""".r
val Re(x) = "xyz"
val Re(y) = "x"
{noformat}
And the other one

{noformat}
".*PTRN.*"
{noformat}
This was an horrible decision whose time for fixing is long gone. It was long gone even when *I* first learned of it, years ago.

The best I can think of is make this behavior depend on a flag, defaulting to present behavior, and with a method returning a sensible behavior-flagged regex. Something like:

{code}
val Re = """(x)""".r.notAnchored
{code}

I suggest you implement it and submit through a pull request on github, then post the link to the pull request here. It is by far the way more likely to produce results.

I could be wrong, but I think he's saying it should have been fixed years ago, not that the statute of limitations on fixing it has run out.

Ok, let me clarify what I think. First, I have been disgusted by the present behavior since 2009. I might even have opened a ticket about. I consider it wrong, but it is a bit in line with Java behavior. String's "matches" works that way.

I *am* saying that "fixing" it could break things. For example:

{code}
string match {
  case p1() => ...
  case p2() => ...
}
{code}

An application might well _depend_ on p1 not doing a partial match, because that's how it has always worked.

If a `@migration` warning -- which did not exist 2 years ago -- is considered good enough, then, yes, I'd _love_ for it to be truly fixed. People can always adjust their regex by enclosing them in anchors if they want the previous behavior.

The solution I proposed enables people who want "correct" behavior to be able to get it, while not breaking any existing code.

Now, just a bit of review on the pull request, I'm a bit concerned about the use of "lazy val" for pattern. Access to a "val" is much faster than to a "lazy val", and pretty much every method needs a compiled pattern. So, while one might save compiling a pattern twice when creating an "unanchored" version, one looses performance everywhere else.
Ok, here's an example of code that might *stop* working:

{code}
val emptyLine = """\s*(?:#.*)?""".r
val code = """([^#]*)(?:#.*)?""".r
def stripComments(lines: Seq[String]) = lines flatMap {
    case emptyLine => None
    case code(x)   => Some(x)
}
{code}

This will _stop working_ if matches suddenly become unanchored.

As for lazy val, it doesn't have an impact only once. It has an impact *every time* pattern gets accessed, which is pretty much by any method called on the regex. The first time it goes through synchronization, but the other times it still has to go through a volatile flag check before retrieving the value.



Daniel,

I've stated twice now that I'm aware there would be changes in behavior if the implicit anchors were removed.  I think we can say we're in violent agreement on that point.

The problem I'm bumping into is construction order.  Regex initializes `pattern` during construction.  I don't see a way to make Regex abstract or a trait (*really* changing existing behavior) which argues that RegexUnAnchored be a subclass which is then returned as the super type with appropriate `pattern` initialization after construction.  My understanding of how to do that is either to use an abstract trait with initialization at the class declaration level [i.e.,
{noformat}
class RegexUA extends { // init here } with Regex with ...
{noformat}
] which is out because Regex as an abstract trait would break 
{noformat}
new Regex("(x)")
{noformat}
(and who knows what else) or to use a lazy val to initialize after full class construction.  My understanding of lazy is based on the single Stack Overflow question.  If it's correct then the initialization of a lazy is based on a volatile but subsequent access is a simple if() clause.  That seems pretty light-weight to me given Scala and Java's hint to not recompile Patterns in tight loops but I don't have enough experience in this area to argue the point.

So what am I left with?  I have no idea since the two ways documented for getting around order of initialization problems are off the table.  I get the feeling I'm frustrating you.  It certainly isn't my intent.  I recognize and appreciate that you don't have to be offering your advice.  I've done development long enough to know that if someone makes suggestions to you when submitting fly-by RFEs you listen to them.  (I have also read your blog entries, SO answers, and other scala comments so have some idea that besides offering advice you also know what you are talking about when you do.) However, ... I'll just leave it at however.

I have an internal solution that works.  If anyone bumps into this RFE it's simple to subclass Regex with an overridden unapplySeq which does not implicitly anchor.  A case class and an implicit def to turn strings into this class using a method (having done perl in a past life I use .qr) is then straightforward. 
I asked for opinions on scala-debate on whether changing the semantics is acceptable. Personally, I'd prefer that as well.

I don't know if you saw the recent discussion on scala-language, but you should bring it up the proposed API changes there if you wish to see this incorporated. I know it was discussed before, but the discussion was mostly about people rejecting the previous proposal, instead of accepting the new proposal.

Yes, sorry.  A lot of this got brought up on scala-debate but I should be clearer here in the jira.

As Regex is currently implemented its unapplySeq uses .match() which attempts to exactly match the regex to the provided string.  In effect it adds the start and end anchors to your regex.  There are several problems with this.  First, you are already supplying a regex and if you wanted anchors presumably you would have supplied them.  I have taught six people Scala and every one has tripped over this with, "Why is it not doing what I tell it?", being the most common complaint.  Second, the quick-and-dirty way to get around this is to add {{".\*"}} to the start and end of your pattern (e.g., {noformat}""".*(\d+).*""".r{noformat}) but this can have a rather surprising performance impact in certain situations because of backtracking.

The current pull request adds a trait which can be used to override unapplySeq to use .find(0) instead of .match().  Additionally it adds a .qr method into StringLike so that a Regex with NoImplicitAnchors can be easily generated just like using .r to get a Regex.

Hope that states the problem and fix better.
And, just to make it explicit, *nothing changes with regards to existing code*. The change presently proposed, after discussion on scala-debate, just add a way to get non-anchored behavior.
That's pretty much my original suggestion (I used {{notAnchored}} instead of {{unanchored}}, but otherwise the same). The method on String was suggested to avoid compiling the pattern twice, as it happens with the [committed patch|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/1475df9bedc03417708f20d94b5e3db5c80f3036].
