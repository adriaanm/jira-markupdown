Scaladoc already processes Java sources and produces Scaladoc for them.
It just ignores the doc comments.

Many of our Scala codebases have at least some Java in them for various reasons.
It'd be SUPER AWESOME (well, "nice" at least) if Scaladoc could generate full documentation for these
mixed codebases, including all doc comments.

It appears this was added briefly by Donna in r22605, then reverted in r22619.
