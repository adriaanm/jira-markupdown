I expected this varargs invocation to work:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final

scala> def foo(ns: Int*) = ns.sum
foo: (ns: Int*)Int

scala> val more = Seq(3, 4)
more: Seq[Int] = List(3, 4)

scala> foo(1, 2, more: _*)
<console>:8: error: no `: _*' annotation allowed here
(such annotations are only allowed in arguments to *-parameters)
       foo(1, 2, more: _*)
                     ^
```

well, I can always do:

```scala
scala> foo(1 +: 2 +: more: _*)
res2: Int = 10
```

but that's not as nice.

(is this minor enough it wouldn't need a SIP? not sure)
I see it involves a specification change, which won't help the cause.  In the usual pdf-paste-borked fashion:
```scala
The last argument in an application may be marked as a sequence argument, e.g. e: _*.Suchanargumentmustcorrespondtoarepeatedparameter(ยง4.6.2)oftype S* and it must be the only argument matching this parameter (i.e. the number of formal parameters and actual arguments must be the same).
```
