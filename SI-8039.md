I think it's pretty reasonable to expect to be able to write a method like this:
{code}
def f[A](xs: Thing[_, A]): A = xs.bippy
{code}
If Thing's first type argument is kind *, you can. If it isn't, then god help you. There's no way most people will ever come up with this. The usual surrender probably involves adding an otherwise pointless type parameter to method f. This is not always an option and definitely shouldn't be mandated.

Here are a few things one might try before hitting upon the syntax which actually works.
{code}
scala> trait Foo[CC[+X], +A]
defined trait Foo

scala> trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[_, A]): A = ???
<console>:8: error: _$1 takes no type parameters, expected: one
       trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[_, A]): A = ???
                                               ^

// That's not what you said about _$1 a minute ago, you sadist.
scala> trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[_[_], A]): A = ???
<console>:8: error: _$1 does not take type parameters
       trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[_[_], A]): A = ???
                                               ^
// If you're lucky enough to come up with the existential syntax for
// higher order type parameters, you will still be burned if you get the
// variance wrong. Remember we're doing all this just to IGNORE IT.
scala> trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[CC forSome { type CC[X] }, A]): A = ???
<console>:8: error: kinds of the type arguments (CC forSome { type CC[X] <: Any },A) \
do not conform to the expected kinds of the type parameters \
(type CC,type A) in trait Foo.
CC forSome { type CC[X] <: Any }'s type parameters do not match \
type CC's expected parameters:
type X is invariant, but type X (in trait Foo) is declared covariant
       trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[CC forSome { type CC[X] }, A]): A = ???
                                           ^
{code}

Colonel Mustard in the conservatory:

{code}
// Nice, three feature warnings for the only way to write it.
scala> trait Foo[CC[+X], +A] ; def f[A](x: Foo[CC forSome { type CC[+X] }, A]): A = ???
warning: there were 3 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined trait Foo
f: [A](x: Foo[CC forSome { type CC[+X] <: Any },A])A
{code}

The Plum lady in the wine cellar.

{code}
scala> trait Foo[CC[+X], +A]
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined trait Foo

scala> trait FooChill { type CC[+X]; type A; type Apply = Foo[CC, A] }
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined trait FooChill

scala> def x: (FooChill{type A = Int})#Apply = ???
x: Foo[_1.CC,Int] forSome { val _1: FooChill{type A = Int} }

{code}
Or, of course:
{code}

scala> def x[B]: (FooChill{type A = B})#Apply = ???
x: [B]=> Foo[_3.CC,B] forSome { val _3: FooChill{type A = B} }

{code}
Okay, that's cool and all, but do you have any good reason why _ should not be kind-polymorphic? Isn't it blazingly obvious what _ means in a '* -> * expected' context? There's always going to be a manual translation available, and obviously you can't refer to things without names, so it's not like soundness is going to come into play. (Not that I think soundness is on anyone's mind.)

I'm not against simplifying this in 2.12, maybe overload _ in one more way.
Given the workaround, type members are the better design when type applications are expected to be partial once in a while.

The proposal does seem to fit nicely with the new bound inference for _.

What? "When type applications are expected to be partial once in a while", have you thought this through? How are you supposed to know what the rest of the world is going to do with your types?  

Not to mention it's disingenuous to suggest one is ever likely to have such freedom that one can hop between type members and type parameters. There are a billion things which constrain this choice - most of them are implementation bugs or inadequacies by design - never once will anyone be so free of those constraints that they'll be able to say "I'll make this a type member because I expect it to be partial once in a while."
