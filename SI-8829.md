scalac does this, and a similar one for -feature:
"there were 2 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details"

When using sbt or Actiavtor, It's fairly involved (especially for newcomers to Scala) to figure out how to get the warning enabled. They aren't running scalac by hand so where and what do you "re-run with -deprecation."

I think the motivation for current behavior of scalac is to follow what javac does. The ticket is here to investigate if we want to flip the default for Scala 2.12.x.
[~sethtisue], maybe organize Twitter campaign to vote on this issue? I think votes would help us to decide quickly on this :-)
I almost feel bad telling you about this now if you've been sublimating throttle feelings toward the repl.
{code}
scala> Pair(1, 2)
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
res0: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

scala> :warnings
<console>:8: warning: object Pair in object Predef is deprecated: Use built-in tuple syntax or Tuple2 instead
              Pair(1, 2)
              ^
{code}
It's been in there about three years. Sorry there's no indication when a warning is suppressed.
This isn't quite as poignant, but:
{code}
scala> Pair(1,2)
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
res0: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

scala> :settings +deprecation

scala> Pair(1,2)
<console>:8: warning: object Pair in object Predef is deprecated: Use built-in tuple syntax or Tuple2 instead
              Pair(1,2)
              ^
res1: (Int, Int) = (1,2)
{code}
The sad thing is that when the {{-deprecation}} flag is not enabled, {{-Xfatal-warnings}} fails:

https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8410

Which is pretty useless, since it offers no way to fix it until you enable the flag.
