I suspect this is related to SI-3133 which showed similar symptoms.  Say you have a pair of Java classes:
{code}
public class Base {
  public class Inner {}
}

public class Derived extends Base {
  public void foo(Inner i) {}
}
{code}
If you run scalac on them with any `-make` recompilation strategy other than `all`, it complains:
{code}
$$ ~/scala/scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
Derived.java:2: error: not found: type Inner
  public void foo(Inner i) {}
                  ^
one error found
{code}
This happens if a method in the derived class takes or returns an instance of the inner class, but not if it merely has a field of the inner type.

With `-make:all` or no `-make` option at all, scalac is happy.

I don't see the error in 2.8.0.RC1 or r21666:
{code}
$$ scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
$$ scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
Recompiling 2 files
$$ scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin/scalac -make:changed *.java
Recompiling 2 files
$$
{code}

It might be a problem that the Java files are always recompiled, but that is a separate issue.
This definitely happens for me in both RC1 and the latest nightly (r21659 as I type) on both my development machines.  What could be in the environment that would influence this?  I've tried with both the standard Sun Java 6 and the OpenJDK Java 6 that Debian packages, with the same result.

Ok, I know why it works for you.  It's a copy fail on my part, the inner class needs to be static for the problem to trigger, in RC1 or the latest nightly:
{code}
public class Base {
  public static class Inner {}
}
{code}

True, though not terribly helpful when dealing with a large, actively developed Java codebase that you're trying to introduce a Scala subsystem into.  The Java devs will push back against that; not using -make:{something} at all is a better workaround in my current situation.

I think SI-1409 seems to be the main reason for this problem. I know it compiles when you just write
{code}
scalac src/B.java src/F.java
{code}

but doesn't work for dependency management because it parses the symbols and their types (and it doesn't know the type of Inner but knows of B.Inner). Because of SI-1409, even if you have just src/B.java and some Scala class that uses the nested static class then you will get type error from the usual compiler (that doesn't happen with full names but I realize that's a workaround far from perfect).
