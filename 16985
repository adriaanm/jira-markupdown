Providing the option `-language:_` should disable feature warnings as described in SIP-18, but it doesn't.

`import language._` works fine, however.
```scala
$ scala -language:_
scala> scala> def x[M[_]] = 3
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
x: [M[_]]=> Int

scala> import language._
import language._

scala> def x[M[_]] = 3
x: [M[_]]=> Int
```
