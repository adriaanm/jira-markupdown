Same code/document, related issue.  Line 253:
{code:java}
@usecase def ++[B](that: GenTraversableOnce[B]): $Coll[B]
{code}

"$Coll" is not correct for Option.  Some(a) ++ Some(b) does *not* return an Option.

This is assuming the Std Lib code is correct and the documentation is wrong, not vice versa.
