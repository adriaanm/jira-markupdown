We need to process large amount of log files, we want to count how many lines error log in total. but seems scala can not handle very large number.

We produced hundreds of GB log files every day, so we need scala to handle large integer.

scala> val x = BigInt(2398472394327498174398217438974918237489321748971489321748932174893271498723)
<console>:1: error: integer number too large
       val x = BigInt(2398472394327498174398217438974918237489321748971489321748932174893271498723)

The only working solutions ,is "Erlang" , it can handle large integer, Can Scala like Erlang , have the ability to handle large integer number?
Literals cannot be that long. use `val x = BigInt("2398472394327498174398217438974918237489321748971489321748932174893271498723")`
The human answers questions about optimizer, and named and default args.

So this was definitely the ScaBot. Or does it call itself ScaNet now?
