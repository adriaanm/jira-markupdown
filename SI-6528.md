Here is the code that was being compiled: https://github.com/barneyii/zutha-lib/tree/master/src/main/scala/net/zutha/lib/collection

I tried to compile with scala 2.9.2 and that pretended to succeed when I compiled in Intellij Idea but it actually didn't finish. When I compiled with 2.9.2 using SBT it failed with a StackOverflowError.

I then tried compiling with Scala 2.10.0 M7 (later changed back to M4 with no effect) and received this error message: https://github.com/barneyii/zutha-lib/blob/master/compile-errors.txt
could reproduce, even with {{scalac -J-Xss10m *.scala}}
