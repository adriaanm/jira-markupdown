If it weren't you jason I'd be pretty skeptical.  Does reporting it against the nightly imply you know it was working in some slightly less recent nightly? The only thing I can imagine causing trouble on windows is r25109 for scala/bug#4703, which fits with your given build but huynhjl said he tried that out and everything was kosher.
