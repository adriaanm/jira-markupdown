Running Ubuntu 9.04 x64

After downloading scala-plugin-09118.zip, the only file available for the latest version 0.15.1, unziping it, and trying to install it in Netbeans 6.7 via the Plugins menu item, Netbeans says:

for Scala Platform:
needs org.netbeans.modules.languages.bat

for Scala Console:
requires plugin External Execution Support in version >= 1.9.1, but only 1.14.1 was found.

Note: C++ plugin is installed. I couldn't find any plugin labeled External Execution Support
