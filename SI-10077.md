{code:scala}
object Main {
    val arr1 = new Array[Byte](10)
    val arr2 = new Array[Byte](10)

    arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
}
{code}

Expected: successful compilation
Actual: 
{noformat}
[error] /tmp/1/Main.scala:5: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Int
[error]  required: Byte
[error]     arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
[error]             ^
[error] one error found
{noformat}

This is because x ^ y is an Int, not a Byte.

{code}
scala> arr1(4) = (arr1(4) ^ arr2(5)).toByte

scala> arr1.update(4, (arr1(4) ^ arr2(5)).toByte)

scala> implicit class cv(val as: Array[Byte]) extends AnyVal {
     | def update(i: Int, v: Int): Unit = as.update(i, v.toByte)
     | }
defined class cv

scala> arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
{code}

Maybe it's possible to spec it in such a way that the conversions are inserted.

Anyway, the proposed fix for SI-9834 is slightly obscurantistical:
{code}
scala> arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
<console>:14: error: value ^= is not a member of Byte
  Expression does not convert to assignment because:
    type mismatch;
     found   : Int
     required: Byte
       arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
               ^
{code}


You don't need Array to demonstrate the issue here:

{code:scala}
scala> var b1 = 0.toByte; b1 ^= b1
<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: Byte
        b1 ^= b1
           ^
{code}

equivalent Java code compiles and the bytecode includes the necessary {{i2b}} instruction.
The error message improvement now shows the expansion, which can be tricky to visualize.
{noformat}
scala> var b1 = 0.toByte ; b1 ^= b1
<console>:13: error: value ^= is not a member of Byte
  Expression does not convert to assignment because:
    type mismatch;
     found   : Int
     required: Byte
    expansion: this.b1 = this.b1.^(b1)
        b1 ^= b1
           ^

scala> val as, bs = new Array[Byte](10)
as: Array[Byte] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
bs: Array[Byte] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

scala> as(4) ^= bs(5)
<console>:14: error: value ^= is not a member of Byte
  Expression does not convert to assignment because:
    type mismatch;
     found   : Int
     required: Byte
    expansion: as.update(4, as.apply(4).^(bs(5)))
       as(4) ^= bs(5)
             ^
{noformat}
It would be nice to highlight the error in the expansion without adding a caret line.
