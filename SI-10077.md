```scala
object Main {
    val arr1 = new Array[Byte](10)
    val arr2 = new Array[Byte](10)

    arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
}
```

Expected: successful compilation
Actual: 
```
[error] /tmp/1/Main.scala:5: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Int
[error]  required: Byte
[error]     arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
[error]             ^
[error] one error found
```
This is because x ^ y is an Int, not a Byte.

```scala
scala> arr1(4) = (arr1(4) ^ arr2(5)).toByte

scala> arr1.update(4, (arr1(4) ^ arr2(5)).toByte)

scala> implicit class cv(val as: Array[Byte]) extends AnyVal {
     | def update(i: Int, v: Int): Unit = as.update(i, v.toByte)
     | }
defined class cv

scala> arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
```

Maybe it's possible to spec it in such a way that the conversions are inserted.

Anyway, the proposed fix for #9834 is slightly obscurantistical:
```scala
scala> arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
<console>:14: error: value ^= is not a member of Byte
  Expression does not convert to assignment because:
    type mismatch;
     found   : Int
     required: Byte
       arr1(4) ^= arr2(5)
               ^
```

You don't need Array to demonstrate the issue here:

```scala
scala> var b1 = 0.toByte; b1 ^= b1
<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: Byte
        b1 ^= b1
           ^
```

equivalent Java code compiles and the bytecode includes the necessary `i2b` instruction.
The error message improvement now shows the expansion, which can be tricky to visualize.
```
scala> var b1 = 0.toByte ; b1 ^= b1
<console>:13: error: value ^= is not a member of Byte
  Expression does not convert to assignment because:
    type mismatch;
     found   : Int
     required: Byte
    expansion: this.b1 = this.b1.^(b1)
        b1 ^= b1
           ^

scala> val as, bs = new Array[Byte](10)
as: Array[Byte] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
bs: Array[Byte] = Array(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

scala> as(4) ^= bs(5)
<console>:14: error: value ^= is not a member of Byte
  Expression does not convert to assignment because:
    type mismatch;
     found   : Int
     required: Byte
    expansion: as.update(4, as.apply(4).^(bs(5)))
       as(4) ^= bs(5)
             ^
```
It would be nice to highlight the error in the expansion without adding a caret line.
