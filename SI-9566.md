In Chapter 1 Lexical Syntax, spec says that "The tokens that can terminate a statement are: literals, identifiers ...".

According to this rule, a statement will be terminated after an operator, which is not true in current implemenation.

E.g. following code in legal in Scala 2.7.11

val foo = "12" +
"34"
Yes, I should pay more attension to the first sentence in this section, "Scala is a line-oriented language where statements *may be* terminated by semi-colons or newlines."
