If it's the same bug I reported six months ago you can't collect the immediate fix bounty. Still no comment on that one: scala/bug#8801

The preference of just-reported bugs over long neglected bugs creates all the wrong incentives. I should probably close my 142 open tickets and re-open them one per day over the next five months.
