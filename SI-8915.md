Because the name of the val is sadly not mentioned, I can't really figure out whether it's caused by some synthetic val generated by the compiler, or by a bug which misses the usage of "arg" inside the try (if the warning is about "arg").
reifiedArgs is not used. But the scary comments inviting me to "take a look inside" deterred me from looking further.

Possibly,
```scala
val reifiedArgs = ann.args.map(f)
//should be
ann.args.foreach(f)
```

The PR for #8040 adds names to the messages and amends this example.
