So, while working on SI-3575 I noticed that AnyRef specialization didn't seem to be working. I created a simple test of AnyRef specialization, noted the failure with master, then tried compiling an example with Scala 2.9.1 and it worked.

Here's the program:

{code}
class C[@specialized(Int, AnyRef) A](v:A)                                                                                   
                                                                                                                            
object Test {                                                                                                               
  def main(args:Array[String]) {                                                                                            
    println(new C(123).getClass.getName)                                                                                    
    println(new C("abc").getClass.getName)                                                                                  
  }                                                                                                                         
}
{code}

The output on 2.9.1 is:

{code}
C$mcI$sp
C$mcT$sp
{code}

Whereas on master it is:

{code}
C$mcI$sp
C
{code}

I know that there was a change recently from using the (totally arbitrary) T to the (Java standard) L for referring to Object/AnyRef, as well as other AnyRef bugfixes. I'm currently trying to do a bisect to figure out when this example stopped working, but haven't figured it out yet.
