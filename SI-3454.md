In defining class paraterms, it seems 'val' and 'var' can be omitted on scala 2.8RC. 
For example,
```scala
  $$ scala
  Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC2 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
  Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
  Type :help for more information.
  
  scala> class X(private x:Int)
  defined class X
```

On the other hand,
```scala
  $$ scala
  Welcome to Scala version 2.7.7.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
  Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
  Type :help for more information.

  scala> class X(private x:Int)
  <console>:1: error: 'val' expected but identifier found.
       class X(private x:Int)
```

I guess that "class X(private x:Int)" will be parsed by Parser#paramClausesr1 method, and it has the following comments,
```scala
  /** ParamClauses      ::= {ParamClause} [[nl] `(' implicit Params `)']
   *  ParamClause       ::= [nl] `(' [Params] ')'
   *  Params            ::= Param {`,' Param}
   *  Param             ::= {Annotation} Id [`:' ParamType] [`=' Expr]
   *  ClassParamClauses ::= {ClassParamClause} [[nl] `(' implicit ClassParams `)']
   *  ClassParamClause  ::= [nl] `(' [ClassParams] ')'
   *  ClassParams       ::= ClassParam {`,' ClassParam}
   *  ClassParam        ::= {Annotation}  [{Modifier} (`val' | `var')] Id [`:' ParamType] [`=' Expr]
   */
   def paramClauses(owner: Name, contextBounds: List[Tree], ofCaseClass: Boolean): List[List[ValDef]] = {
   ...
```

It seems to me, according to the above BNF definitions, "class X(private x:Int)" should be rejected.

Is this a bug, or has the syntax change been planed on 2.8?

(In r22030) Closes #3454, plus one syntax generalization which lets us have mulitple if guards in for expressions without semicolons between them. Review by moors.
Sorry for opening this ticket again, but case class X(private x:Int) is still valid.

```scala

scala> case class X(private x:Int)
defined class X

```

The attached patch has also included the fix for that.
losing "case class X(private x:Int)" seems peculiar. see also #3485
