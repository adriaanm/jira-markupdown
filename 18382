The test case looks like the one for SI-4762, but for completion outside of the class definition.

{code:java}
object ScalaObject {
  class Base(val foo: String)

  class Extended(foo: String) extends Base(foo)

  val ext: Extended = new Extended("foo")

  def test() {
    println((ext: Base).foo)   // completion works on 'foo'
    println(ext.foo)           // completion doesn't work on 'foo'
  }
}
{code}

The code is valid, but the presentation compiler doesn't return {{foo}} when asked for completion on an {{Extended}} element.
