Currently, if a type parameter is ommitted the compiler assumes the lower bound, for instance
{code}
val s = Set() // yields Set[Nothing]
{code}
It would be great to have a means to override this behavior just like
{code}
class A[T = Any]
val a = new A // should yield A[Any]
{code}
Would you like me to provide some daily-life example for this requirement?
