```scala
scala> class Foo[T]
defined class Foo

scala> def foo[T](): Foo[T] = new Foo
foo: [T]()Foo[T]
```

is working, however, when we add a refinement, it doesn't:

```scala
scala> def bar[T](): Foo[T] { type U } = new Foo { type U = Int }
<console>:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Foo[Nothing]{type U = Int}
 required: Foo[T]{type U}
       def bar[T](): Foo[T] { type U } = new Foo { type U = Int }
```

as a workaround, it is needed to specify the type explicitly:

```scala
scala> def baz[T](): Foo[T] { type U } = new Foo [T] { type U = Int }
baz: [T]()Foo[T]{type U}
```

(this issue was found while working on #9361)
