=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===
{code}
try 1
{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The code should not compile. The compiler should give a compilation error.

The syntax specified in the specification, section 6.22, requires  a block inside curly braces after the try keyword. A simple expression after try is not allowed.


=== What do you see instead? ===

{code}
scala> try 1
res0: Int = 1
{code}

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_21
  - Operating system: Windows Vista
