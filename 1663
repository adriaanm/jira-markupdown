This is because at the moment the synthetic methods are inserted, lazy vals don't have the ACCESSOR flag:
```scala
    final def isGetter = isTerm && hasFlag(ACCESSOR) && !nme.isSetterName(name)
[...]
              if (sym.isGetter)
                addBeanGetterMethod(sym)
```
The manipulations of flags on lazy values appear to be quite complex and I am afraid to modify them without spending a lot more time analyzing what they're doing.  Possibly the insertion logic could be changed to something more like isTerm and (hasFlag(ACCESSOR) || hasFlag(LAZY)) ... but I'm not even sure about that because the actual location of a lazy value also looks complicated.

So doing nothing for now, this is just a note for the next guy.
