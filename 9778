I also vote against removing this syntax.

I find it visually useful (more useful than `: Unit =` especially when specifying/guaranteeing that there is no return type), it is well-established (and thus a change would affect many lines of code), and even if it is a source of confusion for newcomers it should be quickly dispelled.
