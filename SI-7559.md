Residual (and more) of SI-6308.

See the "todo" tests in t6308.scala.

And then consider:

SpecializeTypes uses symbol equality all over the place, e.g.

specializedTypeVars(sym).intersect(env.keySet)
These break down if the one side of the equality refers to a type parameter symbol from typer, and another refers to one post-uncurry, which has been cloned during a TypeMap. If the type parameter is bound by an alias type, the TypeMap in uncurry is not an identity, so new symbols are allocated.

The easiest way to see what's happening is to remove the code the preserves symbols through identity type maps:

     /** Called by mapOver to determine whether the original symbols can
       *  be returned, or whether they must be cloned.
       */
-    protected def noChangeToSymbols(origSyms: List[Symbol]): Boolean = {
-      @tailrec def loop(syms: List[Symbol]): Boolean = syms match {
-        case Nil     => true
-        case x :: xs => (x.info eq applyToSymbolInfo(x)) && loop(xs)
-      }
-      loop(origSyms)
-    }
+    protected def noChangeToSymbols(origSyms: List[Symbol]): Boolean = false
And witness the carnage.

AFAIK nothing should be relying on noChangeToSymbols for correctness. Maybe @adriaanm or @paulp could confirm that claim.

Specialization isn't unique in this regard; other facets of the compiler have also grown accustomed to type and value parameter symbols being quasi-constant.

I don't really know how to fix this category of problems. I tried pretty hard a while back in uncurry but ran out of steam. Some interaction with caching of normalized types within TypeRefs finally killed off that effort.

Jason,

I'll be asking more questions as I feel this is rather fundamental issue and I'd like to understand it very well.

Let me share my understanding of Symbol. I always thought of Symbols as objects uniquely representing terms and types. For example, there would be only one symbol for particular {{def}} defined. If that's the case then pointer equality of symbols should work just fine. Now, if  you consider symbol cloning you should have two situations:

1. You clone a symbol but it's still corresponds to the same term/type as original symbol
2. You clone a symbol but it corresponds to a new term/type that you derived from original symbol by some kind of transformation

I believe what you describe in this ticket is instance of 1. Am I correct? If so, why would we ever want to do 1.?
The problem is with type-/value-parameter symbols that hang of the info of those method symbols. Accessing the methods info at later phases runs the type through additiona InfoTransformers. If they modify types of value parameters or bounds of type parameters, new symbols are cloned:
