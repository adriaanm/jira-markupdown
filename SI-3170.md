Suppose we have a script that begins with #! !#

{code}
#! scala
!#

val x = "line 4"
val y = "line 5"
val z "line 6"
{code}

With 2.7.7 the error messages are reasonable:-

{code}
(fragment of A.scala):5: error: '=' expected but string literal found.
val z "line 6"
       ^
{code}

With 2.8.0.r21134-b20100311102012 the reported line number is different and an irrelevant line of code is displayed:-

{code}
discarding <script preamble>
(fragment of A.scala):3: error: '=' expected but string literal found.
val x = "line 4"
                ^
{code}

I can confirm this still happens with 2.8.0.RC2. It only happens when there is a preamble (without is fine) and it seems to consistently display the line above the actual error.

Here's a simple test case:
{code}
#!/bin/sh 
  exec scala $$0 $$@ 
!#

println("statement 1")
println("statement 2".thisisborked)
println("statement 3")
{code}
And the output is:
{code}
(fragment of test.scala):2: error: value thisisborked is not a member of java.lang.String
println("statement 1")
            ^
one error found
{code}
This is a duplicate of SI-3119.  (And I've fixed it, and if possible will check in tomorrow.)
