It's description says: "The smallest difference between two values of Double." However, if you look up its value it's set to java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE.

The *smallest difference* between two Doubles is a lot bigger then the *smallest value* that can be stored in a Double.

Here's an exempt from "float.h":

#define DBL_EPSILON     2.2204460492503131e-016 /* smallest such that 1.0+DBL_EPSILON != 1.0 */

#define DBL_MIN         2.2250738585072014e-308 /* min positive value */
