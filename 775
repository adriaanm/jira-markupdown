I think it had to do with the eclipse project being out of synch with the filesystem, which seems consistent with your intuition. I started to try to isolate the problem last night, and it went away after a refresh. It is not clear to me how eclipse could be out of synch for so long, throughout many, many "Clean" and rebuild operations. Perhaps every clean should force a refresh? Anyway, that is an eclipse issue.

The problem is solved for me, but I think the plugin may still benefit from handling this situation more gracefully. A "None.get" error is equivalent to a Nullpointerexception and if it was my code, I would try to trace it upstream in the stack trace and nip it in the bud by handling the "None" case somewhere, if only with a more informative exception.
