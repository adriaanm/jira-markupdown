The documentation for immutable.Set is presently:
```scala
A generic trait for immutable sets.

$$setnote
```
I can fix that, but $$variable-things which go unfulfilled demand warnings, and there are none being emitted.
(In r24638) Issue warning when doccomments have $$variables which go unfulfilled.
Started with patch by dmharrah.  Noticed expandVariables never
incremented its recursion guard and ended up rewriting it.
To avoid spurious warnings you can escape $$'s, as in this comment:

  /** The decoded name of the symbol, e.g. `==` instead of `\$$eq\$$eq`.
   */

The above will be ignored during expansion and translated to $$eq$$eq
for output.  Closes #4412, no review.
