With the attached source file's classes in the classpath, this fails:

{code}
scala> issue.Test1.t
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl
{code}

(The interpreter has crashed here.)

This succeeds further, but still fails:

{code}
scala> issue.Test2
res0: issue.Test2.type = issue.Test2$$@13dc4d5

scala> issue.Test1.t
res1: issue.Example = issue.Example@1f1a3a8

scala> issue.Test1.t.example
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl
{code}

More:

{code}
scala> issue.Test1.t.example: issue.ENat
res0: issue.ENat = issue.EZero$$@bd4dc2

scala> issue.Test1.t                    
res1: issue.Example = issue.Example@12620b5

scala> issue.Test1.t.example            
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl
{code}

Spelling out t's definition works the same as t.  Everything seems to work fine if you uncomment the return type for example in the source.
