The following code:
```scala
val tb = // create ToolBox
val code = "case class Foo(bar: Int); object Foo"                                                      
tb.eval(tb.parse(code))
```

will result in an error:
```scala
Foo is already defined as (compiler-generated) case class companion object Foo
```

I'm not familiar with the ToolBox implementation, but i'll reckon this bug is just a result of scala/bug#3772.
