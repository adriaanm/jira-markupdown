The following code:
{code:scala}
val tb = // create ToolBox
val code = "case class Foo(bar: Int); object Foo"                                                      
tb.eval(tb.parse(code))
{code}

will result in an error:
{code}
Foo is already defined as (compiler-generated) case class companion object Foo
{code}

I'm not familiar with the ToolBox implementation, but i'll reckon this bug is just a result of SI-3772.
