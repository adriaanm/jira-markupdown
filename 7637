Thanks Jason.  That's very helpful.  I understand the flaw in Either now.  Your solution is nice both to explain and to try out.

That the stock unbiased Either requires a bit more syntax to use the RightProjection/LeftProjection is apparent from the api, but because of this design flaw it's hard to recommend Either.  

Is there an open issue on fixing Either?  Or a consensus that it's not fixable?  Seems like the standard lib should get some combination of a fix, interim documentation, or a replacement.
