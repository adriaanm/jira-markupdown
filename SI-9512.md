As a novice programmer, I noticed that from a distance, Python code is easier to read than Scala code, even when they contain similar content. I would like to have the option to compile Scala code with Python formatting using a compile option that specifies the number of white spaces to use for indentation. 

Example: "scalac -nobrace 2 Main.scala" 
^ For compiling scala code with no curly braces and 2 space indent ^

If it were possible to implement such a feature in the compiler I would appreciate the improvement in legibility.
I'm not quite sure what you are trying to argue. From the last time I tried it, I think I remember that a valid Scala file was also a valid Scalite file. Which issues did you find?

From the docs:

bq. Notably, the fact that Scalite only special-cases lines which do not end in a { means that old-fashioned curly-brace Scala continues to function perfectly fine, and can be mixed together with Scalite code in the same source files and still compile without issue.


Hi John, I'm not the author of Scalite although I would love to steal the praise ;)
I have worked a lot with both curly-braces (Java, Scala, Javascript, HTML, JSON) and indentation-based (Python, Coffeescript, Haskell, HAML, YAML) languages and I prefer indentation-based syntax as well due to:
- fewer discussions about formatting
- fewer lines of code/noise
- easier visual tracking of nesting
- less noise in Git commits (e.g. trailing commas in list definitions)

I don't think that taking the number of Scalite users as an indicator for desirability of this is a fair assessment, because as I mentioned currently your choice is "ordinary Scala syntax + IDE and many tools" vs. "Scalite syntax - IDE and many tools".

So IMO, it would be great to track how many users share the same opinion/desire (given tooling support were given for the indentation syntax) somewhere.
