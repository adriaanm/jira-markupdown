Hello, 

Using lift 0.7-SNAPSHOT, if I override the definition of Menu I get a "malformed Scala signature of MenuItem" runtime exception.

I have attached an archive of the project with the issue.  To recreate it, expand the tar and run "mvn install"

If you do not include the file "src/main/scala/com/tyler/fb/snippet/Menu.scala"
no exception appears.

This is my first report, so please, if you need more let me know.

Thanks


Here is my scala version and stack trace is at the end:

I believe #715 and #1122 are duplicates. Since #1122 is fixed in r15700, this one is presumed fixed also. Let me know if you find out this is not the case.
Thanks Martin, I'll test with a nightly when r15700 is rolled in.

I had an error like this using version 2.7.3. 
I just followed the example in 
http://static.liftweb.net/StartingWithLift.pdf

and having one typing error at one of the first examples (page 15)

class Util {
 def in(html: NodeSeq) =
   if (User.loggedIn_ ?) html else NodeSeq.Empty // note the space
before the question mark

 def out(html : NodeSeq ) =
   if (! User.loggedIn_?) html else NodeSeq.Empty
}
Compiling (i.e. mvn jetty:run) gives this error

As the reports to this point have been less than impressive in terms of ease of reproduction, I'm attaching some code just sent to the mailing list which reproduces this bug.  Compile the attached file meredith.scala and then reference thePOJO2XMLRenderer and you will see:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: malformed Scala signature of XMLRenderer at 1019; reference type _1 of <none> refers to nonexisting symbol.
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$UnPickle.errorBadSignature(UnPickler.scala:763)
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$UnPickle.scala$$tools$$nsc$$symtab$$classfile$$UnPickler$$UnPickle$$$$readSymbol(UnPickler.scala:172)

[...]
```
OK, I got it in r17716.  Before:
```scala
$$ scalac28 meredith.scala  ; scala28 -e 'println(com.sap.dspace.model.othello.thePOJO2XMLRenderer)'
java.lang.RuntimeException: malformed Scala signature of XMLRenderer at 1152; reference type _2 of <none> refers to nonexisting symbol.
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$UnPickle.errorBadSignature(UnPickler.scala:760)
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$UnPickle.scala$$tools$$nsc$$symtab$$classfile$$UnPickler$$UnPickle$$$$readSymbol(UnPickler.scala:172)
```
After:
```scala
$$ scalac meredith.scala  ; scala -e 'println(com.sap.dspace.model.othello.thePOJO2XMLRenderer)'
POJO2XMLRenderer(true)
```
Pickler's pretty freaking complicated so there could be any number of additional bugs in there (and I still hope to rewrite it with my almost-provably-correct strategy) but hopefully the existing troubles all stemmed from this bug.
paul,

i was looking at that bug today as well, see my comment in #1896

Distressingly, it took me until now to figure out that what looked like purely my breakage was some kind of interaction with the new starr which was coincidentally committed just before my patch.  So one more joker in the deck over here.  You're right, #1896 looks intimately related.
I am fairly sure I have both #715 and #1896 fixed, but I'm stymied until I figure out why I can't build with the new starr.  Stay tuned to this channel for further developments.
Now that I've sorted out the starr issues, #715, #1896, and everything else look to be working in r17719.  I haven't committed tests cases yet but those are cooking.
