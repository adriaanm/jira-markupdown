The first one seems to boil down to the case, where both bound type and annotation are used with the same variable. This is the case with `val (x, y)` construct, that is desugared as pattern matching with `@scala.unchecked` annotation.

I get a similar error message with simple
```scala
val x = ("a": String): @deprecated
```
