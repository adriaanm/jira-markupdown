Hi,

The following:
```scala
scala> object Performance {
     |   def timed[T](handleTimerResult : Long => Any)(action : => T) : T = ???
     | }
defined module Performance

scala> object AdvancedUtils {
     |   final def timed[T](f: T): (Long, T) = ???
     | }
defined module AdvancedUtils

scala> import AdvancedUtils._
import AdvancedUtils._

scala> import Performance._
import Performance._

scala> val r = timed("")
<console>:15: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("")
 required: Long => Any
       val r = timed("")
                     ^
```

But the following which have just imports order inverted is working:
```scala
scala> object Performance {
     |   def timed[T](handleTimerResult : Long => Any)(action : => T) : T = ???
     | }
defined module Performance

scala> object AdvancedUtils {
     |   final def timed[T](f: T): (Long, T) = ???
     | }
defined module AdvancedUtils

scala> import Performance._
import Performance._

scala> import AdvancedUtils._
import AdvancedUtils._

scala> val r = timed("")
```

But in Idea we always get the following no matter what order of the imports are:
```
Error:(11, 15) reference to timed is ambiguous;
it is imported twice in the same scope by
import Performance._
and import AdvancedUtils._
lazy val r = timed("");}
             ^
```

For me the compiler of Idea is more accurate.
