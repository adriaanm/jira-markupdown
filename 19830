Because of scala/bug#3101, some triple-quoted strings in the source code for Scala have different line endings depending on how the source files are checked out of version control. This then causes failures because the additional CR characters cause (e.g.) String.equals or String.contains checks to fail.

Affected files include:
- test/junit/scala/io/SourceTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/reflect/internal/PrintersTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/analysis/NullnessAnalyzerTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/opt/InlineWarningTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/opt/InlinerTest.scala
