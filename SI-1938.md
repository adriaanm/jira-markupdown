As expressed by martin in #1093:
```scala
the fix can and should be generalized so as to also allow super
calls on trait fields. Should be relatively straightforward given
the technique (rename trait val fields in addition to trait val
setters).
```
I'm closing that one and opening this one so it's not buried in a comment.
I'm wondering if I can stimulate some interest in addressing this "super on trait fields" feature in an upcoming release.

It would be extremely useful when extending combinator parsers where a base language trait defines some parsers as vals (or lazy vals), then an extension language trait wants to override the parser to add some new constructs, but default back to the base language parser.

There are some work-arounds where the vals are wrapped by defs, but the boilerplate gets in teh way of the cleanest expression of this kind of composition.
I think I'm running into a similar issue. I'm trying to create a simple class:

```scala
class Topping(var name:String)}}
```

That class definition should create the implicit getter and setter for its name attribute. Then, I create a trait this way:

```scala
trait LoggingNameTrait extends Topping {

  override def name_=(aName:String) {
    print(aName)
    super.name_=(aName) // this line doesn't compile
  }

}
```

The Scala compiler doesn't let me trait-overwrite the setter for the name attribute. Is this supposed to work this way (some kind of a language limitation)?
Looks like this is available under -Y.
