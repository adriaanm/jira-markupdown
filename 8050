Oh geez, I found this comment written 2 years, 5 months ago, by me of course.
```scala
/** Note: if a symbol has both @deprecated and @migration annotations and both
 *  warnings are enabled, only the first one checked here will be emitted.
 *  I assume that's a consequence of some code trying to avoid noise by suppressing
 *  warnings after the first, but I think it'd be better if we didn't have to
 *  arbitrarily choose one as more important than the other.
