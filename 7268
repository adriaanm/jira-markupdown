"Side-note: I need to learn to do this faster, 1 bug in 13 hours is pretty bad."

At 13 hours, you're so far ahead of the curve it's not even funny.

The reason those A$sp are owned by the wrong class is that they're not being cloned in produceTypeParameters.  It looks like it is operating under the belief that it can avoid cloning them more frequently than it actually can.  I think the cloning part should look more like this (after renaming variables to be less opaque.)
{code}
    val clonedParams = tparams map (tparam =>
      env get tparam filter (_.typeSymbol.owner == newOwner) match {
        case Some(tp) => tp.typeSymbol
        case _        => tparam cloneSymbol newOwner
      }
    )
{code}
Of course, it shouldn't look like that either, because there is WAY TOO MUCH low-level cloning and most of it is done wrong in one way or another, which is one reason why NSDNHO is not a meaningless string of letters to us like it ought to be.

There's still plenty of bug to be had around here even if that cache change works out.  Stay with it, it's very exciting to have anyone else actively working on stuff like this.
