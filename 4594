> Daniel, have you actually tried the code you pasted with Scala 2.8.0?

Not with a recent build, which explains how I missed the deprecation.

I agree, not with the deprecation, but with the not singling out Vector.  I think it's a terribly unfortunate API design decision, but I can live with it as long as it's not *just* Vector.
