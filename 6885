The patch that was committed doesn't interact well with the edge case in which the elided method call is the right-hand of an assignment.  Now the compiler silently elides the call by emitting nothing, but the resulting class results in a VerifyError.

This is related to SI-5051.  The old transform would turn the expr into a BoxedUnit, which is something.
