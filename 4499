This is a corner case for implicit search which was not specified before. The added specification is below. It does exclude the case of class B, though. So the behavior is as expected.

Views are applied in three situations.
...

3. In a selection $$e.m(\args)$$ with $$e$$ of type $$T$$, if the selector
$$m$$ denotes some member(s) of $$T$$, but none of these members is applicable to the arguments $$\args$$. In this case a view $$v$$ is searched which is applicable to $$e$$ 
and whose result contains a method $$m$$ which is applicable to $$\args$$.
The search proceeds as in the case of implicit parameters, where
the implicit scope is the one of $$T$$.  If such a view is found, the
selection $$e.m$$ is converted to \lstinline@$$v$$($$e$$).$$m(\args)$$@.
