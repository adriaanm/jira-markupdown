I'm not sure if this is really a bug but atleast it seems like unintended consequence.

Using MyEnumeration.values.map(p => (p -> DoSomehtingWith(p)) causes diverging implicit expansion error.
This used to work on 2.8 and 2.9 and you can go around with MyEnumeration.values.toList.map but that seems strange and unnecessary.

More verbose explanation here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9487425/enumeration-and-mapping-with-scala-2-10

This is a library issue, probably caused by https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2d0f82898d
newCanBuildFrom for SortedSet is competing with the normal canBuildFrom.

Since there's an easy workaround (add a toList) and unlikely to be the compiler's fault, lowering priority and re-assigning.

{code}
object Phrase extends Enumeration {
  type Phrase = Value
  val PHRASE1 = Value("My phrase 1")
  val PHRASE2 = Value("My phrase 2")
}

class Entity(text:String)

object Test {
    val myMapWithPhrases = Phrase.values/*.toList*/.map(p => (p -> new Entity(p.toString))).toMap
}
{code}
the other workaround would be to provide an instance of Ordering at Entity:

{code}
implicit object ord extends Ordering[Entity] { def compare(x: Entity, y: Entity) = ??? }
{code}

since values is a SortedSet, that's needed for its canBuildFrom

Stefan, I think we can close, but I'll let you have a second look since you know in more detail what's going on.
