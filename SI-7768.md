This was my most recent idea for modifying implicit search to make contravariance less useless. Maybe someone else would like to pursue it - I realize I've been hogging this brick wall for the last five years, but it feels so good on my head.

This makes sense, and indeed mirrors the contravariant case.

In fact, it seems like we can cover all bases by reformulating
prioritization, ignoring specificity for specificity's sake.
Instead, start by trying for an exact match; then follow the
variance arrow the minimum distance.

class A
class B extends A
class C extends B
class D extends C
class E extends D

class Con[-T](override val toString: String)
class Cov[+T](override val toString: String)

object ConTest {
  implicit val a = new Con[A]("Con[A]")
  implicit val c = new Con[C]("Con[C]")
  implicit val e = new Con[E]("Con[E]")
}
object CovTest {
  implicit val a = new Cov[A]("Cov[A]")
  implicit val c = new Cov[C]("Cov[C]")
  implicit val e = new Cov[E]("Cov[E]")
}

object Test {
  def f1() {
    import ConTest._
    println(List(
      implicitly[Con[A]],
      implicitly[Con[B]],
      implicitly[Con[C]],
      implicitly[Con[D]],
      implicitly[Con[E]]
    ) mkString " ")
  }
  def f2() {
    import CovTest._
    println(List(
      implicitly[Cov[A]],
      implicitly[Cov[B]],
      implicitly[Cov[C]],
      implicitly[Cov[D]],
      implicitly[Cov[E]]
    ) mkString " ")
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    f1()
    f2()
  }
}

/*** 

Currently:

Con[A] Con[A] Con[A] Con[A] Con[A]
Cov[E] Cov[E] Cov[E] Cov[E] Cov[E]

Hypothetically:
