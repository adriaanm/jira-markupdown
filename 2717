T is inferred to be Nothing, not String.  Nothing is a subtype of String, so the second statement is allowed.  More directly,
```scala
scala> val s: String = null.asInstanceOf[Nothing]
s: String = null
```

Of course, Nothing is not supposed to have any instances, so having an actual instance assigned to a val of type Nothing is presumably the cause of the following:
```scala
scala> val s = null.asInstanceOf[Nothing]
java.lang.NullPointerException                   
        at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:9)    
        at RequestResult$$.<clinit>(<console>)    
        at RequestResult$$result(<console>)
        ...
```
