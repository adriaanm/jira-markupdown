Reading section 6.26.3 of the spec, I can't even find what language implies def f[T](x: T): T should be favored over def f[T](x: T, xs: T*): T.  It seems like everyone takes for granted, that the first would be favored over the second if both were applicable, but if it's in the spec it must emerge indirectly from language too complicated for me to dissect right now.
