If you have a ^L character in a source-code file, the Scala compiler appears to treat it as a newline. Vim, however, does not, nor does Emacs (nor Pico for that matter). Normally, a ^L character is used to separate major portions of a file.

The result is that Scala line numbers as reported in errors and stack traces end up larger than what vim or Emacs think.
The cause of this is the following:

```scala
./reflect/scala/reflect/internal/util/StripMarginInterpolator.scala:    def isLi
neBreak(c: Char) = c == '\n' || c == '\f' // compatible with StringLike#isLineBr
eak
```

Presumably StringLike can't be changed, but it's still worth considering whether the compiler needs to follow this, esp. since the major editors don't (likewise the other major compilers, see below).
BTW, `javac` does this correctly (i.e. doesn't treat ^L as a newline); likewise `gcc`, `python`, etc.
It's actually using `Chars.isLineBreakChar` to count lines, so embedded '\r' also is counted.

Since the clients of `pos.line` really are interested in the source line in the usual sense, the fix is to count lines using line endings in the restricted sense.  Then `pos.lineContent` should conform, too.

It would be kind of neat if `pos` meant the Scala view (after Unicode escapes) so that `pos.finalPosition` would yield the "raw" position.  But there doesn't seem to be any demand (or use case).  The scanner knows about line breaks, but after that, `line` returns to its quotidian connotation.
