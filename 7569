From the spec, as unearthed on the recent  mailing list thread:

Normally, only a single \code{nl} token is inserted between two
consecutive non-newline tokens which are on different lines, even if there are multiple lines
between the two tokens. However, if two tokens are separated by at
least one completely blank line (i.e a line which contains no
printable characters), then two \code{nl} tokens are inserted.

As per suggestions on the thread, we will change this to:

Normally, only a single \code{nl} token is inserted between two
consecutive non-newline tokens which are on different lines, even if there are multiple lines
between the two tokens. However, if two tokens are separated by a character sequence containing at least one completely blank line (i.e a line which contains no printable characters), then two \code{nl} tokens are inserted. (it does not matter if the blank line appears within a comment or outside of it)
