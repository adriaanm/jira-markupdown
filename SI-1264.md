It appears that compilation error messages generated when running a scala script (using Scala 2.7.1.final on Ubuntu) are printed to standard out rather than standard error. (scalac, on the other hand, prints compilation errors to standard error.)

For example, if I get a compilation error when running "broken.scala" below, I don't want the output to end up in "result.txt", but printed to standard error:

  $$ scala broken.scala > result.txt

I _think_ that there might still be at least one error message that goes to STDOUT rather than STDERR:
{code}
394	    if (!f.isFile) {
395	      Console.println("no such file: " + scriptFile)
{code}

I'm sorry if I'm wrongly reopening this ticket, but if I'm not, I would suggest looking for any other println:s that could be turned into err.println.
After further investigation, this is because of fsc. This correctly prints to stderr:
{code}
$ scala -nc -e 'foo' > /dev/null
{code}

Personally I think fsc should just be fully deprecated and `-nc` turned on by default...

Anyway, a fix is coming.
