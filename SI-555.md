The Scala editor will think this code has an error:
{code}
package foo

case class Foo[A](v: A) {
  
}
{code}

The error is 'not found: type A'. If I remove the 'case' modifier, it works fine. The error is showed only inline, by underlining the 'A' in the constructor, and when hovering. The 'Problems' panel is empty.

The 'Error log' is filled with 'breaking probably infinite loop with...'.
