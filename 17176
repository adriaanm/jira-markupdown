There is no way to define a string interpolation template separately from the interpolation, nor to compose multiple templates.  [Thread.|https://groups.google.com/group/scala-sips/browse_thread/thread/de7ea273874bb1d] It was suggested by Miles that
{noformat}
It'd be nice if we could get that back and write something like,

 // Inferred type should be Int => String
final val template = s"""This is string $(_:Int)."""

Then all of your examples boil down to function application and/or composition.
{noformat}
to which eugene said "Could you submit an enhancement request for that please?", a request which I am presently fielding.
