This patch to build.xml makes the following enhancements:

1.  Only the scala.home and the path to scala-compiler.jar must be set (scala-compiler is not in the scala-dev universe, so it cannot be assumed to reside in ${scala.home}/lib).  The other jars are available in the universe and are explicitly specified.

2.  No more checking if xxx.jar is available.  The jars are explicitly referenced in build.classpath and test.classpath, so if they are missing, the build will fail with an error indicating that they are not available.  Since junit and servlet-api are available in scala-dev, they are assumed to be available.

3.  A check is performed to see if the developer has created build.properties and edited it for his development environment.  If not, the script will copy build.properties.SAMPLE into build.properties, and alert the developer that it is missing.  It will also alert the developer which dependencies are required to build.

4.  A war is created so the sbaz servlet can easily be tested.  An optional ${sbaz.servlet.dir} build property can be set, and will be used to create the war's web.xml.
I can't review the whole patch right now, but as one quick comment, scala-compiler.jar is available in scala-dev in the "scala-devel" package.  For build.properties, I think it would be fine just to say the properties aren't set, without checking for file existence and without making a file copy.  The file copy could mean that one build fails and the next succeeds -- but with default options rather than user-chosen ones.

Otherwise these changes sound fine, though I haven't looked at the diff.
