This code compiles...
```scala
abstract class Prova2 extends Dynamic {
  def applyDynamic(m: String)(): Unit
  //private def privateMethod() = ()
}

object Prova extends App {
  val prova= new Prova2 {
    def applyDynamic(m: String)() = ()
  }
  prova.privateMethod()
}
```
... but if you uncomment that privateMethod declaration, it fails to compile:
Prova.scala:5: error: method privateMethod in class Prova2 cannot be accessed in Prova2
  prova.privateMethod()
        ^

Sorry I didn't comment on this earlier.

I proposed a patch for this issue in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/98 -- together with a fix for #4536. Let me know if you need two separate patches.
See my comment on #4536, which I will reproduce so you don't have to: "I don't know what happened, but that link to github is to an xml equality patch. Does the patch still exist somewhere?"
Apparently repositories were renamed: https://github.com/scala/legacy-svn-scala/pull/98
