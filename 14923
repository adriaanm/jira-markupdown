The presentation compiler seems to have issues when an object is defined with the same name as a case class.

Steps to reproduce:

(1) Create a file Foo.scala:

{code}
package test

object Foo {
  
}
case class Foo(t: String) {

}
{code}

(2) Open editor

(3) Notice that the editor shows two incorrect errors (construction definition not allowed here and constructor Foo is defined twice).

The file is actually compiled fine and nothing is shown in the Problems view. scalac also handles the file fine:

{code}
/opt/scala-2.8.0.Beta1-RC8/bin/scalac test/Foo.scala
{code}
