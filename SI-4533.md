I really think there should be some backstop which prevents code with ErrorTypes from waltzing all the way from typer to pickler to crash there.  I found that even avoiding pickling doesn't help: the error isn't caught in refchecks, and it crashes once something tries to deal with the ErrorType.

The error is due to the qualifier being inaccessible (it's private[collection]).

```scala
package demo

import scala.collection._

class CrashDemo {
  def statusByAlarms(alarms: GenTraversableOnce[FooAlarm]) = println("hello")
}
class FooAlarm { }
```
```scala
scalac29 ./0430.scala 
error: scala.tools.nsc.FatalError: bad type: <error>(class scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$ErrorType$$)
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.Pickler$$Pickle.scala$$tools$$nsc$$symtab$$classfile$$Pickler$$Pickle$$$$putType(Pickler.scala:214)

	at scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized$$class.foreach(LinearSeqOptimized.scala:59)
	at scala.collection.immutable.List.foreach(List.scala:45)
```
With r24854, the crash is gone: 

```scala
bt4.scala:6: error: erroneous or inaccessible type
  def statusByAlarms(alarms: GenTraversableOnce[FooAlarm]) = println("hello")
                             ^
one error found
```

Not sure what you mean. The error gives no information on what the problem is. The fact that Paul, on the mailing list, was somewhat more specific than the error message, doesn't make the error message helpful. In 2.10.0-M6 I've gotten it in situations where it should have been a "no such identifier" as well as where it should have been "type mismatch" (as trivial tweaking revealed). The error shows that either (a) the problem is being detected at a point where scalac doesn't know more information, which is a problem --- it should either detect it at the point where it has the information, or it should have the information at the point it detects it; or (b) it has the information but it's not printing it.
