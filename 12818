I have two projects, a and b, that resp. contain packages a and b. Project b's build path has a dependency on project a, but the import a._ in project b does not work. Is this a known limitation?
```scala
package a

class AA {

}
```
```scala
package b

import a._ // error: value a not found :-(

class BB extends AA {

}
```

I've attached a zip of the two folders in my workspace to help reproduce the problem.
