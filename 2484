This looks great.  I'm happy to see ways to improve implicit-related error messages.  What do you think about something similar at the definition site of a method with implicit parameters.  Something like:
```scala
@implicitNotFound(msg="Custom msg referencing ${y} ...")
def x(implicit y: Z) ...
```
