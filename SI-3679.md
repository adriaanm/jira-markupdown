I'm trying to tune/optimize Scala-IDE, and during my
investigation I saw something strange reference of 2
ScalaPresentationCompiler (sub type of interactive.Global) co-located in the same Reference Tree.

I think the cause is usage of *mutable object* NoPhase (mutable object doesn't allow multiple context, in our case multiple Global)

form nsc.NoPhase
{code}

object NoPhase extends Phase(null) {
 def name = "<no phase>"
 def run { throw new Error("NoPhase.run") }
}
{code}
and Phase is a mutable structure
{code}
abstract class Phase(val prev: Phase) {
...
 private var nx: Phase = this
 if (prev ne null) prev.nx = this
{code}
So every time NoPhase is define as a previous of a Phase instance its nx field is updated.

Some Phase subtypes are inner class with $$outer to there Global (in our case ScalaPresentationCompiler)

eg : from nsc.Global :
{code}
   private val firstPhase = {
...
     val phase1 = syntaxAnalyzer.newPhase(NoPhase)
{code}

So NoPhase could retains big Global instance.

I attach a screenshot of a memory analyze (I can post the heap dump if you need)
(In r22644) Fixes SI-3679. Review by milessabin.
When I saw the fix, I say "whao, so simple ! why I didn't think about it ?"
After some though, I know why (some are matter of taste), IMO :
* parent class should no contains special case drive by test of subtype.
* The fixe is not correct (IMO). It fixes the memory leak  but not the hidden part of the problem : *NoPhase break the contract of Phase*.

The Phase type represente a item in a chain, and allow navigation via next or via prev. And NoPhase don't allow navigation form end to end in both sens without including special test case for NoPhase and storing referent Phase.
So the fix could introduce bad side effect, eg if existing code call NoPhase.next during a chain navigation (to go back,...)

May be I'm not clear ?

Sorry for late comments.
*NoPhase? break the contract of Phase* I think that's intentional. It's like saying 
null breaks the contract of String. NoPhase is used as a sentinel object. It's not a normal phase.
