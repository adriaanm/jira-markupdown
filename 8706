It is pretty much intentional indeed. Strings in Scala offer either multiline capability or escape characters, but not both at the same time, nor neither at the same time.

String interpolators make it possible to have any particular combination, by letting multiline be decided by the number of quotes, and escaping be decided by the interpolator.

Though I do see the potential for confusion, and I'm certain plenty will arise from it, I think it was the right choice. I wouldn't be bold enough to make it, but I find it easy to support Odersky on this. :-)

This particular ticket is not a bug, because there's nothing for the \ before $ to escape. If you use the raw interpolator, it will work. If you double the backslashes, it will work. Everything is according to spec, and, at most, a better error message is required. I'd call it enhancement.
