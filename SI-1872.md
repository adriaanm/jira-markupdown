    if (i.isInstanceOf[scala.AnyRef])

  }
}

I guess this is happening because scala.Int is currently being implemented using javal.lang.Integer. Unless native implementation is provided, I don't think it will be easy to fix.

(In r23988) This outlaws explicit isInstanceOf tests on value types, which
are nonsense in any case, as long threatened in ticket SI-1872.
Closes SI-1872, review by rytz.
