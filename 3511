Note to self: people are constantly expressing confusion at error messages like this:
{code}
found  : Int
required: String
{code}
...understandably enough, because they just happen to be doing something with '+' and the compiler unhelpfully interprets their efforts as something involving any2stringadd.  Boy I'd sure like to turn that light off someday.
