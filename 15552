During profiling my application with !YourKit, I've found that 2% of the execution time is consumed in `Predef.intWrapper` as called from:

{code}
trait ResizableArray[A] ... { 
  // ...
  protected def initialSize: Int = 16
  protected var array: Array[AnyRef] = new Array[AnyRef](initialSize max 1)
{code}

This is called when mapping over `ArrayBuffer`s.

Given that escape analysis isn't enabled in recent JVMs, it might be wise to change this to `max(initialSize, 1)`.

A micro-optimisation, to be sure, but I might not be the only one it helps.
