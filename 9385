Thinking about it some more, it just came back to me a dist was never rolled for M1. Some required dependencies were not available.

*queue "that sinking feeling"*

I built 2.11.0-M2 with 2.10-built actors. I've updated the release process document to make sure this step isn't skipped next time.
It also doesn't have scala-swing.

I propose I cut a quick M3 in two weeks and call the first two milestones a dud.
