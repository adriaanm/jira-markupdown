(In r24414) An overhaul of slice and related implementations (primarily
that is drop and take.) In the course of trying to get it working
consistently (mostly with respect to negative indices, which were
dealt with arbitrarily differently across the 25+ concrete
implementations) I fixed various bugs.

Closes scala/bug#4288, no review.
