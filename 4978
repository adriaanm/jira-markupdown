Closing. Even if we wanted to, we can't change this in a backwards compatible way.

With 2.10.0 you will be able to add:
```scala
  override def toString = myCaseClassToString(this)
```

Where `myCaseClassToString` is a macro that can see the parameter names.

If the research into macro annotations bears fruit, you could shorten this to:
```scala
@myCaseToString
case class Person(...)
```

But we can't make any promises about that feature.

Unfortunately that reflection/macro API is still marked as experimental for 2.10.x, but you might find this sort of use case compelling enough to live with the possibility of a little flux.
