```scala
scala> "Les Mise\u0301rables"
res0: java.lang.String = Les Mis�rables

scala> res0.reverse
res1: scala.runtime.RichString = selbaŕesiM seL
```
Works in 2.8:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r0-b20091109091326 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).

scala>  val out = new java.io.PrintStream(System.out, true, "UTF-8")
out: java.io.PrintStream = java.io.PrintStream@b4ef239

scala>  val miserable = "Les Mis?rables"
miserable: java.lang.String = Les Mis?rables

scala>  out.println(miserable.reverse)
selbar�siM seL
```

(Inspired by http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050208053951714)

I opened #2596 to deal with Console.println/the interpreter not printing utf correctly.
I'll leave this closed, but note that the issue is still there. The original ticket used unicode combining chars, an e followed by an accute sign, not an accented e, like in �. Here's the full test with output:

```scala
object Test extends Application {
  val out = new java.io.PrintStream(System.out, true, "UTF-8")
  val xs = "Les Mise\u0301rables"
  val ys = "Les Mis�rables"
  out.println(xs)
  out.println(xs.reverse)
  out.println(ys)
  out.println(ys.reverse)
}
```

giving:

```scala
Les Mis�rables
selbaŕesiM seL
Les Mis�rables
selbar�siM seL
```
Replying to [comment:3 extempore]:
> We don't have a String reversing function, we have a sequence reversing function

But then you should rename "{{RichString}}" to "{{RichCharSequence}}" :-). 

If a method is called `RichString.reverse`, the natural thing is to expect it to produce something that is the reverse of the string. You have to either swap combiners with their corresponding base characters before or after the reverse, or normalize the string before reversing ([http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/Normalizer.html java.text.Normalizer], but see http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/07/06/nfc).

```scala
scala> import java.text.Normalizer._
import java.text.Normalizer._

scala> val s = "souf\ufb02e\u0301s" 
s: java.lang.String = soufﬂés

scala> s.reverse                    
res6: scala.runtime.RichString = śeﬂfuos

scala> normalize(s,Form.NFC).reverse
res7: scala.runtime.RichString = s�ﬂfuos

scala> normalize(s,Form.NFKC).reverse
res8: scala.runtime.RichString = s�lffuos
```

Reopening, this should either be fixed, or resolved as wontfix with a good reason.
