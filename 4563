(In r23523) ant, build.xml and classpath issues.  It looks like everyone has
been ignoring their painstakingly set classpaths and using whatever
they can find in the vicinity of the scala script, which works OK
for pack but not so well for quick.

I also added a build.xml feature so you can drop jars into a dir and
have them automatically used everywhere.  The directory is lib/extra.
Pro tip: add lib/extra to .gitignore and put jars like
yjp-controller-api-redist.jar in there.

Closes SI-3706, no review.
