Being able to toggle the "Concrete" and "Abstract" buttons is nice, but I think it'd be better to put all the abstract members of a trait/class in their own section above the concrete members.  Figuring out how to minimally implement a trait/abstract class is easily in the top 10-20 use cases for scaladoc. :)
