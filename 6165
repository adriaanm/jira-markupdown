If Scala was already matching the Java behavior, and we wanted to do better, then maybe a new name would be needed. But currently getClass in Scala sucks compared to getClass in Java. If all we want is to bring lame Scala up to awesome Java's level, then it should be fine to just call it getClass, yes?

In Java 6 "The actual result type is Class<? extends |X|> where |X| is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which getClass is called." See scala/bug#490.
