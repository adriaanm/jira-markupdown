I doubt it has anything to do with the filename or the operating system.  You're feeding in an empty string somehow.  In 2.9.0-1 empty strings were dropped from the program arguments, but this was itself a bug (e.g. scala/bug#4782.)

You can get the identical error like this.
```
% scalac291 ""
error: source file '' could not be found
one error found
```
