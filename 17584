Type casting in Actor.scala:64 fails with a ClassCastException when migrating remote actors. This prevents migration of remote actors at the early stage of actor migration.
The line that fails in Actor.scala:64:
```scala
def self: Actor = self(Scheduler).asInstanceOf[Actor]
```

The fix is very simple and has local effects. The invocations to `Actor.self` should be replaced with `self(Scheduler)` in the code of remote actors. The fix is already prepared and can be seen in:
