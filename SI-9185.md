The current implementation of TraversableLike.toString traverses everything to generate a string holding all elements:
def toString = mkString(stringPrefix + "(", ", ", ")")

I had a case of an Iterable iterating over a large amount (180 million) elements, and toString got indirectly called, causing a rather unusual slowdown I had to search for a while for. Is it not theoretically possible a TraversableLike traverses through an infinite amount of elements, and thus the above implementation is dangerous? 

My suggestion would be that toString limits itself to a certain number of elements (maybe the first 100) and indicates that there are more with an ellipsis ("...") instead of just concatenating everything? 
I don't think we can change this under our constraints of backwards compatibility. Within the standard library, potentially infinite concrete collections override `toString`:

```
scala> Stream.from(0)
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(0, ?)

scala> Iterator.from(0)
res2: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator
```
