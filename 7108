It doesn't matter what the map contains, or how you personally interpret flatmap - it matters that the operation is invoked on a map, and the result of the operation are elements which make another map.  If you want a List, make it a List.
{code}
scala> m.toList flatMap (_._2)
res0: List[(Int, Int)] = List((1,11), (1,111), (2,22), (2,222))
{code}
