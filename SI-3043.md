In r20833 with this code:

```scala
class C {
  val a = "a"

  def run(runnable: Runnable) {
    runnable.run()
  }

  implicit def blockToRunnable(block: =>Unit) = new Runnable() {
    def run = block
  }

  def c() = run {
    println(a.toString)
  }
}
```

If I remove `a.toString` and retype `a.`, auto completion doesn't work. Also, no single character hints like my previous ticket get it to finally show up, I can type out `a.toStri<Ctrl-Space>` and it still reports "tree not found" in the console.

Perhaps this and #3042 are the same issue, but this no-popup-at-all behavior is what I actually wanted to file a bug for, and found the previous bug of "oh, hey, it does pop up in this situation" as I was on the way to reproducing this one.
(In r20928) Fixed #3043 and #3043; fixed a regression with hover/hyperlinks on import statements; don't attempt to parse out top-level types from non-Scala sources. Review by community.
