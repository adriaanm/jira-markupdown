This is the bug causing it:
[http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4071957]

Since Sun does not appear to ever fix this, a suggested workaround was to do:
{code}
method.setAccessible(true)
{code}
This obviously only works when the SecurityManager allows it, but that would be no worse than current behavior.
