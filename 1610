This has always bugged me a lot too.  There were actually two bugs in there, in that in addition to it favoring <sub>/tmp over java.io.tmpdir/something, it would try to create all potential candidates before picking one; so no matter what you did that </sub>/tmp directory would get recreated every time you run fsc, even if it used its first choice under scala.home.

Fixed in r17215.  I don't see any reason this would impact windows, but since I don't have windows to test I trust someone will let me know if anything's broken.
