The following code:
```scala
trait SymbolLoaders {
  class SymbolLoader
  type LoadersPlatform <: Platform      { type PlatformLoaders <: SymbolLoaders.this.type }
  
  val platform: LoadersPlatform
}
 
trait Platform {
  type PlatformLoaders <: SymbolLoaders { type LoadersPlatform <: Platform.this.type }

  val loaders: PlatformLoaders
}

trait JavaPlatform extends Platform {
  type PlatformLoaders = loaders.type 

  object loaders extends SymbolLoaders {
    type LoadersPlatform = JavaPlatform.this.type  
    
    val platform: JavaPlatform.this.type = ???    
  }
}
```

doesn't compile with the cyclic error reported:

```scala
illegal cyclic reference involving type PlatformLoaders
  type PlatformLoaders = loaders.type
```

According to Adriaan, this should compile. We tried to debug it for a while and the cyclic error is thrown at [Types.scala:3507](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Types.scala#L3507):
```scala
    if (sym1.isAliasType && sameLength(sym1.info.typeParams, args) && !sym1.lockOK)
      throw new RecoverableCyclicReference(sym1)
```

because it calls to `sym1.info`.

I'm not sure if we'll have time to look more deeply into this. However, I can refer to this ticket from a code where I need to insert casts as work-arounds for this problem.
That might be some kind of record for most confusing reproduction. PlatformLoaders! LoadersPlatform! SymbolLoaders! An unused SymbolLoader! LOAD ALL THE THINGS!

Somewhat reduced.

```scala
trait P { type A ; val v: A }
trait Q extends P { type A = v.type }
// ./a.scala:2: error: illegal cyclic reference involving type A
// trait Q extends P { type A = v.type }
//                              ^
// one error found
```
Thanks for looking into that. It's true that I missed `SymbolLoader` which is not used anywhere in this example.

Now, when it comes to reproduction I think yours is slightly different (too small). If you change `JavaPlatform` to look like this:
```scala
trait JavaPlatform extends Platform {
  type PlatformLoaders = loaders2.type 

  object loaders2 extends SymbolLoaders {
    type LoadersPlatform = JavaPlatform.this.type  
    
    val platform: JavaPlatform.this.type = ???    
  }
  val loaders: loaders2.type = loaders2
}
```

then the cyclic error disappears. All we did was an introduction of a dummy object `loaders2` but the cycle is still there. If this typecheck then the original code should type check as well.
What I meant by "too small" is that using structural types or abstract types won't get us that far. Compare this (which compiles):
```scala
class Foo {
  class C1 { val x: C2 }
  class C2 { val y: C1 }
}
```

with this (which doesn't compile):

```scala
class Foo {
  type T1 = { val x: T2 }
  type T2 = { val y: T1 }
}
```


I gave my original code another whirl. Here's a simplified sample (compared to what I originally reported) which compiles:

```scala
package test2

abstract class Component1 {  
  val comp2: Component2 {
    val comp1: Component1.this.type
  }
  def foo: String = "Hello, I'm Component1"
}

abstract class Component2 { 
  val comp1: Component1 {
    val comp2: Component2.this.type
  }
}

class Main {
  object comp1 extends Component1 {
    val comp2: Main.this.comp2.type = Main.this.comp2
  }
  object comp2 extends Component2 { 
    val comp1: Main.this.comp1.type = Main.this.comp1
  }
}
```

It compiles because we are using nominal types: object comp1 and object comp2. The problem is that I cannot override those objects so I cannot do something like:

```scala
class SubMain extends Main {
  override object comp1 extends Component1 {
    val comp2: SubMain.this.comp2.type = SubMain.this.comp2
    override def foo: String = "Hello, I'm overriden in SubMain"
  }
}
```
FYI.
```
% scalac ./a.scala  -Yoverride-objects
%
```
If I turn SubMain into object I get:

```scala
scalac -Yoverride-objects a.scala
error: 
     while compiling: a.scala

Yeah. However, one thing I was wondering is what's the type of overridden val corresponding to an object? In other words, if we override an object and we add a new methods in the overriding object are we going to be able to see them? If so, it means that we refine a type when we override (which is what I expect) but in a super class the type is already a singleton type (of the object) so there's not much you can do, right?
You can still refine a singleton type. If I understand the question, the fact that this compiles answers it; otherwise maybe reformulate it.
```scala
trait A {
  val x: AnyRef
  def f: x.type
}
trait B extends A {
  override val x: String
  def g = f.length
}
```
