It looks like this needs to be clarified in the spec first. Section [5.3.2](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#case-classes) only mentions:
```
If a companion object c exists already, no new object is created, but the apply and unapply methods are added to the existing object instead.
```

It does not define in which situations these methods are not generated.
