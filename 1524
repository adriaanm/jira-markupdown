I installed 2.8.0.r17137-b200902180022844 on another machine with Eclipse and EclEmma,
and now I am seeing EclEmma's highlights in Java editor view.

So that's good.

I tried to uninstall 2.8.0 and re-install 2.7.3, to re-verify the bug and fix on this machine, but now Eclipse is dieing on Startup.

I suspect the general Eclipse problems are not Scala-specific, just general instability around Eclipse and plugin management.

So, 2.8.0 nightly seems to resolve the EclEmma problem. If anyone else can verify the fix and not see other Eclipse problems, consider this bug fixed.

Thanks, Miles!
