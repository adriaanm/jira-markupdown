= problem =
The left pane of: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html

After clicking on "display packages only" the packages get collapsed, but updating the state of the "hide/show" button is forgotten.
= analysis =
Using that toggle results in:
 - Wrong text on each individual package "header".
 - It is necessary to click twice to get a package extended.

= enhancement recommendation =
The text and the state of the button should be updated when collapsing(/extending) the packages.
(In r24795) [scaladoc] kindFilter should switch show/hide anchor of package. Closes #4463. Review by malayeri.
