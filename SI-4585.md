see for example [http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.SetLike] where the type parameters **A** and **This** are missing. At my site scaladoc processes only the first of two @tparam tags. This was o.k. with 2.8.1
In the meantime I've found the reason at my site: **@tparam A[X]** is no more treated as valid. I must write **@tparam A** instead.
So the only remaining question is why the scala API doc does not show the type param documentation?
Thanks, Peter
I agree it's a little annoying, but it's the correct behavior. `A` is not the same thing as `A\[X\]` so they shouldn't be exchanged.
