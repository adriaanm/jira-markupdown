(extempore in [r25427|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25427]) Working on jar creation infrastructure.  Now if -d foo.jar is used for
output generation (but only then, since otherwise we're not creating the jar):

  1) -Xmain-class foo.Bar will give the jar a Main-Class of foo.Bar
  2) Alternatively, if there is only one runnable program, that will be the Main-Class
  3) Always, the jar's manifest will have an entry for Scala-Compiler-Version.

Not very relatedly, a warning is now issued when a module has a main method but
a runnable program will not be generated.  Closes SI-4861.

This represents an opening step toward automatically recognizing mismatched
bytecode situations: coarse, but useful and safe.  Review by mirco.
