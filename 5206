I'm primarily talking about the scaladoc, which offers the signature shown in the ticket.  We can consider the fact that the compiler fakes the bynameness an implementation detail: I don't think it needs to be documented at the user level.  But we can't give it the wrong signature.

By the way, the reason this came up was that it was making fixing the "warn dead code" option very difficult, because:
```scala
  f(throw new Exception)
  g(throw new Exception)
```
The contents of method f are unreachable if f is by-name, but not g.  So the compiler, believing "synchronized" to be a normal method, would complain about all such blocks.  And I had to add more hacks to hack around the first hack.

That kind of thing makes me believe that synchronized should be implemented as a by-name method, and rather than special casing it where it is now, we special case the closure creation later.
