With scala-2.10.0.r25850-b20111019023417, compiling:
{code:title=RecursiveValueNeedsType.scala|borderStyle=solid}
object RecursiveValueNeedsType {

  def foo(param: String) = 42
  def bar(n: Int) = 42

  {
    val xxx = foo(param = null)
    val param = bar(xxx)
  }
  
}
{code}

Gives the error:
{noformat}
RecursiveValueNeedsType.scala:8: error: recursive value xxx needs type
    val param = bar(xxx)
{noformat}
very similar symptom in SI-6051
If you wrap such a code with a ScalaTest test, instead of a type checker confusion you get a compiler error:
{code}
    [error] Unknown type: <error>, <error> [class scala.reflect.internal.Types$ErrorType$, class scala.reflect.internal.Types$ErrorType$] TypeRef? false
    [trace] Stack trace suppressed: run last test:compile for the full output.
    [error] (test:compile) scala.reflect.internal.FatalError: Unknown type: <error>, <error> [class scala.reflect.internal.Types$ErrorType$, class scala.reflect.internal.Types$ErrorType$] TypeRef? false
{code}
You can find exemplary code [here|https://github.com/falconepl/scala-bugs/blob/master/src/test/scala/simple/FooServiceTest.scala].
This gives a pretty reasonable error message these days:

{noformat}
qscalac test/pending/pos/t5091.scala
test/pending/pos/t5091.scala:8: error: recursive value xxx needs type
    val param = bar(xxx)
                    ^
test/pending/pos/t5091.scala:7: warning: type-checking the invocation of method foo checks if the named argument expression 'param = ...' is a valid assignment
in the current scope. The resulting type inference error (see above) can be fixed by providing an explicit type in the local definition for param.
    val xxx = foo(param = null)
                        ^
one warning found
one error found
{noformat}
To fix this issue with the current Scala version (<= 2.11.4), the type of {{param}} must be added: {{val param: Int = bar(xxx)}}.
The above code example will compile without warning or error in 2.11.5, right ?

Actually, when I compile your project in SBT, this is what I get:
{code}
[error] /home/.../SI-5091-Scala-2-11-6-Reopen/Test.scala:6: recursive value x needs type
[error]     val id = x + 1
[error]              ^
[error] one error found
[error] (compile:compile) Compilation failed
{code}
@[~suhinini]
No, it's not. They are the same. But, as far as I understand, this issue is closed as it has been concluded that such a message is enough for this wierd typechecking cycle. See other comments, especially those by [~retronym]: {quote}I'm planning to close this one with that error message in a neg test{quote}.
*Update:*
OK, as Jason pointed out, it's that additional warning (to the compile error) that is swallowed by SBT.
related to SI-8342. we plan to dis-ambiguate the {{foo(a = x)}} syntax so that it can only mean a named argument, not an assignment to {{a}}.
