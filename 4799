I did a little **very** preliminary investigation into this.  It appears to be caused by a bug in map2Conserve which assumes that the two lists are of **exactly** equal size.  At the call-site, this translates into an assumption that the formal and actual type parameters have equal cardinality, which **should** in general be true as earlier sections of the compiler should have caught this issue by now.  However, it appears that under certain situations, you can get types that will unify under cases that **should** have raised a kind mismatch error, allowing the formals and actuals to be of different cardinality at this point.  Kris is attaching a reproducible case.

Disclaimer: Much of the above is an educated guess, based on what we're seeing, what dups the issue, my preliminary crawling through the compiler sources, and what little I know of the kind system implementation in scalac.
