Are you running on JDK 1.7 by any chance? Two fixes to parallel collections were backported to 2.9.2:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/0e49b37
  https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/1016522

The second one is relevant here: It fixed selection of the suitable backend for the parallel collections, after the JDK Vendor property changed from Sun to Oracle.

Your stack trace indicates that you are using the {{ThreadPoolTaskSupport}}, which is definitely less efficient than {{ForkJoinTaskSupport}}. But I'm not aware of any difference between the two that might contribute to this bug.
