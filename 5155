(In r24042) Integrated contributed non-recursive implementation of permutations,
combinations, subsets, by EastSun.  Also gave mutable Seqs an
in-place transform method like the one Map has.  And couldn't
resist slightly reformulating a few set methods, because how can we
settle for "forall(that.contains)" when we could have "this forall that".
(Which is also what normal people hear when we talk about sets.)

Closes SI-4060, SI-3644, review by moors.
