Compiling the following code with scalac 2.8.x will not terminate:

```scala
sealed trait Bool {
    type If[T <: Up, F <: Up, Up] <: Up
}
sealed trait True extends Bool {
    type If[T <: Up, F <: Up, Up] = T
}
sealed trait False extends Bool {
    type If[T <: Up, F <: Up, Up] = F
}

class Field[E, N <: Bool](implicit val default: N#If[Option[E], E, Any]) {
    type NotNull = Field[E, False]

    def notNull: NotNull = new NotNull

}
```

Removing the def notNull line allows this to compile, so the bug seems to be in implicit resolution.

Tried with

 * Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04) Java !HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03, mixed mode) 
  * scalac 2.7.5final (Ubuntu Karmic package)
  * scalac 2.9.0.r23446 from SVN
 * OpenJDK Runtime Environment (!IcedTea6 1.9) (6b20-1.9-0ubuntu1) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0-b16, mixed mode)
  * scalac 2.8.0 (final) from maven with sbt
  * scalac 2.8.1.RC4 from maven with sbt

scalac 2.7.5final terminates with

```scala
$$ scalac bug.scala
bug.scala:24: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type False#If[Option[E],E,Any] was found.
    def NOT_NULL: NotNull = new NotNull
                            ^
one error found
```

All the 2.8.x/2.9.x versions eventually diverge with 100% CPU usage, no growth in memory usage and as of 5 minutes of running, no stack overflow.
(In r24090) closes #3977. another case of dealiasing a type, analysing the result, and then using the original one, which could lead to cycles.
