Jar postprocessing tool. 

Firstly I did download it, I don't know who you are so I ran it under an zero privilege user account. It didn't work. I forget the exact error message. 

I'm glad it didn't work. Because if it had worked I would have just patched our production code-base with unknown modifications provided by someone I've never heard of via the Internet.

Lets be honest, if I had an employee and they did that, I'd fire their ass.

If the tool is legitimate why does the Scala project not run it upon the libraries which they release?

When I download from Ubuntu, Redhat, Microsoft, Oracle or any other provider the product works. I don't need to download a binary modifier from an unknown third party to get them to work. 

I don't even know why I'm entertaining the idea. It's so far off of what's considered responsible or normal project behaviour. I know I'd be laughed out of the office if I told them I'd done it.

So seriously, when will I be able to compile Scala files and use them in Eclipse without sending my workspace red?
