Aside from the lack of thread safety, the example works without the private member, which is in fact unused in the code, like the warning says.  You can add the hook without the assignment.

But if you did need to hold a reference (to avoid garbage collection), it would be nice to have a way to turn off the warning; see other tix about turning off warnings, or let's call it "tuning" warnings.

Besides the thread safety between the hook and receive, there's also a race because you set the hook before initializing everything else. (In an object, with the init run from static block, maybe there's a guarantee about the hook not running?)
