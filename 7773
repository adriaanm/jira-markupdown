Actually, in the first place you don't want to generate "unappliers". You want to be able to define a tree replacement for the pattern in a `CaseDef` to match whatever you are looking for. 

Couldn't an unapply macro be treated in a way that allows to replace {{new ContextExtensions(ctx).q.unapply(...)}} (i.e. the macro call) by a completely different pattern tree instead of by an invocation to some other (maybe generated) unapply implementation?
