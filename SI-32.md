There should be a `RuntimeAnnotation` class which would allow new annotations with `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME` to be created in Scala.  Currently, these have to be written in Java and compiled in a separate step.
See the recent discussion: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-language/XWbSI1rKYns/6UDFhAzw4xoJ
Also related to #7041 and the discussion in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1924. I'm actually not at all convinced that "RuntimeAnnotation class is needed".
