Does anything block somebody productively championing this (writing a SIP, updating the patch, delivering an impassioned plea to Martin, waiting for Martin to finish *x* other things so that he has time to consider this class of thing)?

Additional desired syntax, if this is supported in (primary) constructors:
```scala
class Stuff([[mods]] lazy val a: Int, [[mods]] def b: Int)
```

translating to (modulo named-argument issues):
```scala
class Stuff(a': => Int, b': => Int) {
  [[mods]] lazy val a: Int = a'
  [[mods]] def b: Int = b'
}
```
