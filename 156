Does anything block somebody productively championing this (writing a SIP, updating the patch, delivering an impassioned plea to Martin, waiting for Martin to finish _x_ other things so that he has time to consider this class of thing)?

Additional desired syntax, if this is supported in (primary) constructors:

{code}
class Stuff([[mods]] lazy val a: Int, [[mods]] def b: Int)
{code}

translating to (modulo named-argument issues):

{code}
class Stuff(a': => Int, b': => Int) {
  [[mods]] lazy val a: Int = a'
  [[mods]] def b: Int = b'
}
{code}
