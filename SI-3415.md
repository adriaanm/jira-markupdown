This bug was introduced in Scala 2.8.0RC2. In a Scala project if we define a Java annotation with default values and try to compile we get the following message: "not found: type _root_".

An annotation like the following produces the above compilation error

{code}
public @interface MyAnnotation {

  String name() default "spiros";
}
{code}

This bug is really important since the only reason a Scala programmer has to write Java is for defining annotations. Many of the mixed Scala/Java projects contain annotations and this bug prevents any development in those projects.

I can reproduce this from the command line.

It might be related to the default argument changes that happen recently in trunk r21794.

Given the Java annotation

{code}
package hello;

import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Documented
@Inherited
public @interface Hello {
  String msg() default "hello world";
}
{code}

and the Scala class:

{code}
package hello

class HelloWorld {
  @Hello
  def method() { }
}
{code}

when I try to compile from the command line using the command _scalac hello/*_ I get the following message:
{code}
hello/Hello.java:10: error: not found: type _root_
  String msg() default "hello world";
         ^
hello/HelloWorld.scala:4: error: annotation hello.Hello is missing argument msg
  @Hello
   ^
two errors found
{code}
(In r21891) close SI-3415. relates to r21680. review by milessabin.
This also appears to have fixed SI-3398.
(extempore in [r25923|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25923]) Fix for SI-3415 regression.

Now there's an unlikely fix.  No review.
