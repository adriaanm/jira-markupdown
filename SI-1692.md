I have a Scala project in Eclipse. I can open most files fine,
but when I try to open one named Functions.scala the editor
fails and shows a blank edit window, a blue line, and an error
message:

Resource '/project/.../Functions.scala' does not exist

I tried opening by double clicking the icon in the Package Explorer
and by selecting Open With > Scala Editor. Open With > Text Editor also fails.

The Package Explorer shows the classes and objects in the class
(it compiles fine) and the outline view also shows the contents
correctly. 

I've refreshed the project, closed and reopened the project, but the problem persists.

There is no exception or error listed in the Eclipse Error log.

The source file exists (I can open/edit it in Emacs, for example) and the file properties show that it exists, has 6,421 bytes. I have read/write access to the file.

If I copy the file (in Navigator) to !CopyOfFunctions.scala
then I can open !CopyOfFunctions.scala without a problem.

If I rename the file in Navigator to !OldFunctions.scala
and then copy that file to Functions.scala, then
return to Package Explorer, I can open !OldFunctions.scala
but not Functions.scala

However, if I copy the file to another project,
I can open it there.

While renaming this to !SomethingElse.scala is a workaround,
I'd prefer a fix because renaming the file would disconnect the
source from the history in CVS.


Not very much I can do with this without a reproducible test case I'm afraid. Are you able to provide the problematic source file?
