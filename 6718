> Note that this bug isn't documented in Java; the documentation for Pattern.split() implies it should work the way I consider correct.

The behavior is documented both at String#split and Pattern#split.  I'm not sure what you are reading.

String: "Trailing empty strings are therefore not included in the resulting array."

Pattern: "If n is zero then the pattern will be applied as many times as possible, the array can have any length, and trailing empty strings will be discarded."

Sometimes you have to live with imperfections.  The benefit to deviating from java's behavior has to be quite marked to compensate for the fact that it is different.  "Fixing" this fails that test.
