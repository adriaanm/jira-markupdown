If you have a mixed java/scala project with the following code:

{code:title=src/java/BadList.java}
class BadList extends java.util.ArrayList {}
```scala

{code:title=src/scala/UseIt.scala}
class UseIt {
  val list = new BadList
}
```

and you compile it, you get an error:

```
./scalac -sourcepath src/java src/scala/*
src/java/BadList.java:1: error: missing type arguments
class BadList extends java.util.ArrayList {}
                                ^
one error found
```

This only happens if you have the scala compiler read in the source for BadList.java. If you compile the java first and put it in a jar and run "scalac -classpath badlist.jar src/scala/*" then it works.

Of course there's the simple work-around of changing the java code to use generics, but this is not necessarily quick to do in a large mixed scala/java project with legacy java code.
