I agree, "sort{A]" should read "sort[A]". The 2.8 spec exhibits thay typo in Sec. 7.2, page 107. 

While we're at the 2.8 spec, a phrase appears duplicated on the 2nd paragraph of Ch. 2 (page 15), where it reads: 
"Bindings of different kinds have a precedence defined on them: Bindings of different kinds have a precedence defined on them"

One more typo? The LaTeX command \commadots appears verbatim on p. 77 (first paragraph in Sec. 6.6)
