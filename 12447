During an  [event of the London Scala Users Group|https://www.meetup.com/london-scala/events/233994868/], we have been able to reduce this example to the following code: 

{code:scala}
package object foo
package foo {
  case class Bar(value: Int) extends AnyVal
}
object Test extends App {
  import foo._
  Bar(5).equals( Bar(5) )
}
{code}

We have also found out that this behaviour is due to the fact that, when the package object declaration preceeds the package declaration, then there are several files that get omitted from the bytecode. This seems to be another bug.
