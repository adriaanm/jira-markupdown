We get a compiler error when trying to partially apply a /: (left fold)

def f(xs: List[Int]) = (0 /: xs) _

<console>:15: error: missing arguments for method /: in trait TraversableOnce;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function

Here are some workarounds:

def f(xs: List[Int]) = xs.foldLeft(0) _
def f(xs: List[Int]) = xs./:(0) _
def f(xs: List[Int]): ((Int, Int) => Int) => Int = (0 /: xs)

This is essentially a duplicate of #1980 because they're both caused by the odd desugaring performed on right associative operations.  Maybe I can get both.
