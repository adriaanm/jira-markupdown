=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index/index-m.html

E. g.
{code}
make
  Array ArrayBuilder List QueueModule Stream WrappedArray
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Array should have a strike-through, because make is deprecated.

Additionally if all usages are deprecated the index items should have a strike-through, too.


=== What do you see instead? ===
