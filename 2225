Are you /sure/ this is fixed? I just installed the nightly build for today and the problem is still there - even for the text example I gave above. In fact I think it may have got worse. 

When I add some whitespace to C, I get the following recompile messages on the console:

compiling Set(/home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/A.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/Hello.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/Maps.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/C.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/B.scala)

Maps and Hello aren't even connected to the test files. These are files from a completely different test I was doing for other features - there are no import links in either direction between these files and A/B/C.


According to Eclipse, I have the following installed:
     Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r19542-b20091112040618


Are there any known work around? Why does nobody else seem to be having problems with building projects in Scala?
