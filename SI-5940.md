if you do need to define macro implementations along with the rest of your program, consider two-phase compilation with -Xmacro-fallback-classpath in the second phase pointing to the output of the first phase

But this is only at **compile time**, right? When you compile the macro, and when you compile something else that uses the macro. When that something is is **run**, there's no need for scala-reflect.jar anymore, is there?
