huge 2016 thread on this at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-user/VRmZ-XrFr0U/zFWJKUovBgAJ . most of the thread is about shenanigans involving `asInstanceOf`, but you don't actually need `asInstanceOf` to get into trouble.

one of the "other situations" Lukas mentions is with generic types:
```scala
scala> class Sloppy[A] { var value: A = _ }
defined class Sloppy

scala> new Sloppy[Double].value
res14: Double = 0.0

scala> new Sloppy[Double].value: Any
res15: Any = null

scala> new Sloppy[Double].value: AnyVal
res16: AnyVal = null

scala> println(new Sloppy[Double].value)
null
```
