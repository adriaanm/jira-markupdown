It would be nice if it would be possible to add @BeanProperty to methods such that
@BeanProperty def foo: String

will result in the compiler creating a getFoo method that calls foo

and 
@BeanProperty def foo_=(s: String)

will result in the compiler creating a setFoo method that calls foo_=





this is a duplicate of SI-2215
I don't think it is a duplicate. SI-2215 discusses the case
  @BeanProperty var foo_ = "hi"
  def foo_=(s: String) = foo_ = s

And the expectation is to generate a setFoo (not setFoo_) and call foo_= (not foo__=)

I wish for a simpler case
  @BeanProperty def foo_=(s: String) = // whatever

to create a setFoo to call foo_. I think it is a lot simpler
the problem you're having is that it's hard to define a property with a custom setter and at the same time generate a bean getter. that's what SI-2215 is about.

i agree that your solution is simpler, but we'll try to fix the more general case which looks less ad-hoc.
