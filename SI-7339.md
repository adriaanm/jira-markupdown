Sometime since 2.10.1 this little devil has snuck in. How is it that we have no test which covers this... if you compile the crasher file with other files, it may not crash (that's how.) Right now if you try with 2.10.x to compile scala/collection/mutable/ArrayOps.scala all by itself, it will crash; but compile the entire library, and you're okay.

BONUS CONFOUNDING FACTOR!

After grek couldn't reproduce it, I had to kick a little harder. The behavior only materializes if you skip locker. It uses 2.10.1 for starr, and that is enough to make it go boom.

So from a clean checkout of origin/2.10.x:
{code}
ant -Dlocker.skip=1 build
./build/pack/bin/scala -nc -e 'class B { 0 max 0 }'
{code}
It is fairly disturbing that the delta between 2.10.1 and current 2.10.x is a) enough to break things in the absence of locker and b) break them in a way which is basically impossible to connect to the cause unless you're one of a tiny handful of people. So we had better do something about this somewhere - abandon the idea of skipping locker, or greatly hardening the lockerless build.

Turns out that there was confusion around {{-Dlocker.skip}} and [{{starr.number}}|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.x/starr.number]. For the record, the {{starr.number}} is not being used by the build as noted in this commit: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/88b7a7241484657f77e38d8f788255966f14c709

Once proper (2.10.1) starr was used this issue disappeared.
Thanks for the explanation; eventually, I will understand the new build.  I couldn't reproduce the issue and just assumed I wasn't one of the handful of tiny people.

Some parts of the new build are experimental like {{skip.locker=1}} option. I created https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2363 which should help to understand what's going on when use that option.
