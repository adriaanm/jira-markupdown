The patch forthcame at
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/444

The patch tries to honor the history of the code, e.g., scala/bug#3480, scala/bug#1764, scala/bug#1878 and the proximate scala/bug#3189, by not being too ambitious.  As usual, this was a GLE (great learning experience) and hopefully the tests provide adequate coverage (as in cover me).
