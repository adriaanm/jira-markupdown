The patch forthcame at
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/444

The patch tries to honor the history of the code, e.g., SI-3480, SI-1764, SI-1878 and the proximate SI-3189, by not being too ambitious.  As usual, this was a GLE (great learning experience) and hopefully the tests provide adequate coverage (as in cover me).
