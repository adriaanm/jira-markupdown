It's because you're using a null value in a generator (isDirectory == true does not guarantee listFiles != null.) Try it this way:
```scala
      def files() = top.listFiles match {
        case null => Nil
        case xs   => xs.toList
      }
      if (top.isDirectory) {
          for (fn <- files) walk(fn)
      } else {
          println(top)
      }
```
