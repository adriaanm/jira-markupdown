Operator '<==' has lower precedence than '&', which causes the following code to not work:
```scala
(this + ("foo", "bar")) & -this & this <== socialMessage
```

Changing '<==' into '<' or '<--' causes it to work fine:
```scala
(this + ("foo", "bar")) & -this & this <-- socialMessage
```

As Scala operator precedence depends only on the first character, it should not matter whether the operator '<==' or '<--' is used.
