Not all the way from the ground anyway.  It gets stuck apparently forever in locker.comp:
{code}
locker.comp:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /scala/trunk/build/locker/classes/compiler
[scalacfork] Compiling 211 files to /scala/trunk/build/locker/classes/compiler
[...never to be heard from again]
{code}
If I add -optimise manually to the various quick targets I can get an optimised build, but this issue means I can't just do ant -Dscalac.args="-optimise" and it's also likely that diagnosing it will reveal some outstanding issue with optimization.
