No, it wasn't necessary under windows 7. It is already hexnumpad for the real unicode (the so-called Alt-Plus method). I think that was only necessary for Vista (and reboot your pc).

This issue is only about keying in so if you managed to key a glyph in the repl with the numpad and shows up as a square or a question mark, I am happy too, though I think the REPL source code should be modified to handle numpad event key ins inluding alt combinations.

This issue is not about displaying the glyph (because that is another chapter), but if you want an open source free unicode ttf font for the console you can install DejaVu fonts and use the Sans Mono = sans serif, monospaced (so far this one has the best unicode support as far as I know, maybe there is a unicode font in  windows office but that is not free, if you know a better one I'd like to know):

I use Deja Vu Sans Mono. This is no console font but you can use it as if it were a console font.
Console fonts have special requirements: 
see: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q247815 

The fonts must meet the following criteria to be available in a command session window: 
The font must be a fixed-pitch font.
The font cannot be an italic font.
The font cannot have a negative A or C space.
If it is a TrueType font, it must be FF_MODERN.
If it is not a TrueType font, it must be OEM_CHARSET.
Additional criteria for Asian installations: 
If it is not a TrueType font, the face name must be "Terminal."
If it is an Asian TrueType font, it must also be an Asian character set.

so that is why you cant use every gui font that works for Notepad in the console. Current version of DejaVu Unicode is until version 4.0. Latest Unicode version 6.0 so ot is not upto date with the latest version of Unicode.
Just download from http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page , unzip go to ttf directory select all ttf files, right mouse click install

To make the font working 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont\000
You already have 0 and 00 name/value pairs for the default fonts (Consolas and Lucida Console)
If you already have a 000 then you must add an extra 0
Create a name/value pair type REG_SZ
name : 000 
value: DejaVu Sans Mono

In the console properties you have then an extra font to select. For Japanese characters I get squares btw so that doesn't work.

Things that do work in my console:
☆ U+2606  (mathematical kleisli star)
∃ U+2203   (mathematical any symbol)
€ U+20AC   (euro sign currency symbol)

The kleisli star looks a bit to small for this font in comparison with any symbol but it works.

But you can use the unihan Unicode database which has a nice look up interface you can search for code and also paste in an unknown character from which you want to know the unicode:
http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html

Beware that ALT-0-1-6-3 combination is not really an unicode combination but windows 1252 codepage which is equal to unicode and since it is 1 byte only for the first 256 codes (0-255) except for (128-159), so in this case it works.
see http://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/goglobal/cc305145 (the list contains also use cases that probably work with default console fonts)

Since I have a laptop I have the press (Fn) as well to key in on the numpad
So if you have a separate numpad you don't have to do that.
Alt-Plus method keying in unicode:
☆ U+2606  (mathematical kleisli star) (Fn) ALT + 2 6 0 6
∃ U+2203   (mathematical any symbol)   (Fn) ALT + 2 2 0 3
€ U+20AC   (euro sign currency symbol) (Fn) ALT + 2 0 a c

This one below is probably better if you don't want to install a new font, kleisli star and any symbol won't work with default console fonts.
Note also the differences between the different key-ins for the same glyph:
Unicode (Alt-Plus method): ê U+00EA   (e circum flex)   (Fn) ALT + 0 0 e a
Ansi cp 850 on my pc! (old school way): ê       (e circum flex)   (Fn) ALT 1 3 6
Windows cp 1252: ê   (e circum flex)   (Fn) ALT 0 2 3 4

Beware that + is on the numpad, not the other + key above = (on my keyboard)

"For instance I can't get '£' to paste with your clipboard workaround (it get translated to 'ú' instead)."
Then it's still in some ANSI encoding. Convert to utf-8 without bom in notepad++ or another editor capable of converting encodings.

You can check you ansi codepage in the console with chcp. Mine is 850 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_850 . For another it's maybe 437. Sofar I didn't have to change the codepage in the console. It is possible with chcp 65001 (for utf-8) but it is not necessary for this issue. I don't know why but maybe windows recognizes utf-8 encoded bytes in the clipboard.
 
To make the Scala REPL work in unicode utf-8 modify this line in scala.bat and add -Dfile.encoding="UTF-8"
so that it looks:
set _PROPS=-Dscala.home="%_SCALA_HOME%" -Denv.emacs="%EMACS%" -Dfile.encoding="UTF-8"
