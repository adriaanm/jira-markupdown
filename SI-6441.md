It seems that *Symbol.isOverride* is not working properly if the *override* modifier is not set explicitly.

```scala
scala> trait A { val a: Traversable[Int] }
defined trait A

scala> trait B extends A { override val a: List[Int] }
defined trait B

scala> trait C extends A { val a: List[Int] }
defined trait C

scala> typeOf[B].members.last.isOverride
res0: Boolean = true

scala> typeOf[C].members.last.isOverride
res1: Boolean = false
```

The last instruction is returning **false**, despite of being overridding the *a* attribute.
Here's a little comment I've had in the compiler source a long time.  The OVERRIDE flag (which is what isOverride checks) only reliably corresponds to the word "override" appearing in source.
```scala
    // !!! When if ever will this answer differ from .isOverride?
    // How/where is the OVERRIDE flag managed, as compared to how checks
    // based on type membership will evaluate?
    def isOverridingSymbol = owner.isClass && (
      owner.ancestors exists (cls => matchingSymbol(cls, owner.thisType) != NoSymbol)
    )
```
