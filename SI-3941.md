Methods with repeated parameters are hard to handle. According to specification, the parameter type is Seq, but somehow such method does not ACCEPT (cannot be called with) a single parameter of type Seq. This causes trouble (and mismatches specification)

Here the override cannot call super:
{code}
class V1 {
 def x(p: String*){
	 print ("V1")
 }
}
class V2 extends V1 {
	override def x(p: String*){
		print ("V2")
		super.x(p)//syntax error: type mismatch, found String*, required String
                    //but how to call the super implementation? The number of args is not known upfront.
	}
}

class V3 extends V1 {
	override def x(p: Seq[String]){ //syntax error: x overrides nothing
		print ("V2")
	}
}
{code}

It feels natural to pass a sequence as a single argument to method with repeated argument, since the repeated argument is just a syntactic shortcut for a Seq. In fact, why not make this completely equivalent from method signature standpoint, allowing to freely derive from a * method to Seq method and vice versa (see class V3 above)

Please don't use trac for support.
{code}
super.x(p: _*)
{code}
