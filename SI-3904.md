The current convention of ^superscript^ in scaladoc 2 does not work well for documenting scala. ^ is an operator (in regexes at least, and I would suspect for xor also), and this leads to unneccessary contortions to get around this markup. I would suggest that, in line with ,,subscript,, and __underline__, ^^superscript^^ be delimited with double punctuation marks. I realize this is different from the Trac markup syntax, but feel it would be significantly beneficial to the scala doc effort as a whole.
