I'm going to say this is a bug in GenICode's implementation of finally blocks.

I improved the pattern matcher a bit to avoid emitting all these BoxedUnits,
and then the diff between -optimize and -optimize -Xoldpatmat becomes

new pattern matcher:
```scala
   0:	aload_0
   1:	invokespecial	#10; //Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
   4:	goto	8 // this should be a return! (it's completely wrong to jump to 8)
   7:	astore_1
   8:	aload_1
   9:	athrow
```

correct bytecode:
```scala
   0:	aload_0
   1:	invokespecial	#10; //Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
   4:	return
   5:	astore_1
   6:	aload_1
   7:	athrow
```


test code (bytecode above is for testIncompatStackHeight)
```scala
class testIncompatStackHeight {
  null match { case _ => }

  try { "" } finally { null match { case _ => } }
}

class testExpectedObjectRef {
  null match { case _ => }

  try { } finally { null match { case _ => } }
}
```
