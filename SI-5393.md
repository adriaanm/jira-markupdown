While working on a project I started seeing the compiler crash even with 2048M of heap available.  I was able to track it down to a pattern match and I've posted a project that shows the behavior to github: https://github.com/davewhittaker/pattern_match_bug.  If you clone it and run "sbt compile" you'll see the issue.  A jstack of the process during the compile shows that it gets hung up in scala.tools.nsc.matching.MatrixAdditions$MatrixExhaustiveness$ExhaustivenessChecker and I've posted a gist of that as well https://gist.github.com/1627701.
FYI: -Yvirtpatmat fixes this issue.

I cloned the repo and checked with 2.10.0-M1:
```scala

git diff
diff --git a/build.sbt b/build.sbt
index a2f72de..6596ab7 100644

```

NOTE: I changed dependencies so those compiled against 2.9.1 were used even if we compile with 2.10.0-M1. This doesn't matter that much because we are interested in compiler crash and not binary compatibility issues.

I was able to reproduce the problem with such setup. However, after adding "-Yvirtpatmat" to scalacOptions it compiled successfully and very quickly.
