I'm using Scala-2.10.0-M7 with the following sbt flags
{code}
scalacOptions ++= Seq("-deprecation", "-unchecked", "-feature", "-language:implicitConversions,reflectiveCalls,postfixOps,higherKinds,existentials")
{code}

Everything compiles fine but during my classes instantiation I get:

{code}
[error] Could not create an instance of XXXX
[error]   caused by scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing
[error]   scala.Predef$.$qmark$qmark$qmark(Predef.scala:246)
[error]   scala.language$.implicitConversions$lzycompute(language.scala:68)
[error]   scala.language$.implicitConversions(language.scala:68)
{code}

The XXXX class mentioned above is a class I'm trying to instantiate with the "newInstance" method. I'm creating this as a bug because my code otherwise compiles fine and I was not expecting a runtime error here.
You can reproduce this issue by cloning this branch: https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/tree/1.13

and running {{sbt "test-only -- xonly"}}
The SIP shows default initializer _ and does sanction
\\
{code}
implicit val postfixOps = language.postFixOps
// as opposed to
implicit val foo: languageFeature.implicitConversions = ???
//or
implicit lazy val foo = language.implicitConversions
// or how about
implicit @elidable(elidable.MINIMUM) def foo = language.implicitConversions
{code}

Ok, here's the issue:

{code}
package org.specs2
package control


trait LanguageFeatures {
  implicit val implicitsAreAllowed = language.implicitConversions
  implicit val postfixOpsAreAllowed = language.postfixOps
}

trait NoLanguageFeatures extends LanguageFeatures {
  override implicit val implicitsAreAllowed = language.implicitConversions
  override implicit val postfixOpsAreAllowed = language.postfixOps
}

{code}


These should be lazy vals, not vals, which is a huge tax to impose on implementers really.  I can update the documentation, then I'm going to mark this as "won't fix" for now.    We may want to think about warning the exact situation where a user assigns a language feature to a val or var.
I guess this idiom doesn't work with traits quite yet, but inlining an elided def is light and somewhat safe from accidental invocation:
{code}
class Enabled {
  import annotation.elidable
  //@unused("Language feature types are mere phantoms of the mind")
  @inline @elidable(elidable.MINIMUM)
  implicit protected final def implicits = language.implicitConversions
  //i.e., def implicits: languageFeature.implicitConversions = null
}
{code}
