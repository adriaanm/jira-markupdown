None of the following examples raise a compiler warning:

{code}
sealed abstract class Base 
case class Derived extends Base 
 
object Test extends Application 
{ 
  def foo(b : Base) = { 
    b match { 
      case d : Derived => 10 
    } 
  } 
} 
{code}

{code}
sealed case class Base 
case class Derived extends Base 
 
object Test extends Application 
{ 
  def foo(b : Base) = { 
    b match { 
      case d : Derived => 10 
    } 
  } 
} 
{code}

The difference is that in one Base is a abstract class and in the second it is
concrete.

Even using

{code}
sealed class Base 
class Derived extends Base 
{code}

doesn't generate any warnings.

Why is does it matter that the base class is abstract?  Doesn't it just matter that it has
the sealed modifier?  One should still not be able to extend Base in any other files
besides the one it is defined in.
