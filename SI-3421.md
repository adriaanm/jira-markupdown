Hi.
I'm using Hibernate (3.5.1-Final) as JPA2-provider and am experiencing problems after upgrading to RC2.

I have the following annotations:
{code}
@Entity
@Table(name = "origo_routable_entity")
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "entity_id")
class RoutableEntity(
	@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)
	@JoinColumn(name = "calendar_entry_id")
	@BeanProperty
	var calendarEntry: CalendarEntry,
...
...

class CalendarEntry(
...) {
...
	@BeanProperty
	@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = Array(CascadeType.ALL), mappedBy = "calendarEntry")
	var routableEntity: RoutableEntity = null

{code}

OneToOne relation between RoutableEntity and CalendarEntry where RoutableEntity is the "owning" side. This compiles just fine but throws an exception at runtime when starting the application:
{code}
Caused by: org.hibernate.AnnotationException: Referenced property not a (One|Many)ToOne: no.officenet.origo.calendar.domain.model.calendarentry.RoutableEntity.calendarEntry in mappedBy of no.officenet.origo.calendar.domain.model.calendarentry.CalendarEntry.routableEntity
        at org.hibernate.cfg.OneToOneSecondPass.doSecondPass(OneToOneSecondPass.java:220)

{code}

This works fine in RC1.
For some reason the exception was cut off in the example, should have been:

{code}
Caused by: org.hibernate.AnnotationException: Referenced property not a (One|Many)ToOne: no.officenet.origo.calendar.domain.model.calendarentry.RoutableEntity.calendarEntry in mappedBy of no.officenet.origo.calendar.domain.model.calendarentry.CalendarEntry.routableEntity

{code}
Hi,

I think that your bug is triggered by a (correct) fix we added in RC2.

When annotating a constructor argument, the annotation only ends up on the actual argument of the constructor, but not on any of the generated fields / getters / setters. Due to a bug, this was different in RC1 (and before), the annotation would end up on the fields as well.

What you need to do is add a meta-annotation to the annotation type, see documentation here: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/annotation/target/field.html

In your case, you probably want something like

{code}
import annotation.target.field

@Entity
@Table(name = "origo_routable_entity")
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name = "entity_id")
class RoutableEntity(
	@(OneToOne @field)(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)
	@(JoinColumn @field)(name = "calendar_entry_id")
	@BeanProperty
	var calendarEntry: CalendarEntry,
{code}

You can define type aliases to improve the readability

{code}
object MyAnnotations {
  type OneToOne = jpa.OneToOne @field
  type JoinColumn = jpa.JoinColumn @field
}
{code}

and then import / use these annotations instead of the original ones.
BTW: Does this mean that now one cannot do this?
{code}
class Klass(@BeanProperty var name: String) {}
{code}
But have to do this instead?
{code}
class Klass(_name: String) {
@BeanProperty var name = _name
}
{code}

Replying to [comment:6 andreak]:
> BTW: Does this mean that now one cannot do this?

No, `@BeanPorperty` on a parameter still works as expected. The reason is that the `BeanProperty` annotation itself is meta-annotated with `@field`, see http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/reflect/BeanProperty.scala
