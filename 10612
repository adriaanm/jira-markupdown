I believe that the bytecode of class "com.aldebaran.proxy.Variant"  declares that is has an inner class `Variant$typeV`. The Scala classpath implementation expects to be able to find that on the classpath.

Can you post the output of the following:
```
% jar -tf jnaoqi-1.14.5.jar | grep Variant
% javap -verbose -classpath jnaoqi-1.14.5.jar com.aldebaran.proxy.Variant
```

It is possible that scalac is less tolerant of the missing class than javac.
