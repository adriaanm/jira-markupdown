I noticed that in Scala 2.7.1-final, you can't compile this, but it works great in Scala 2.7.1.r14702-b20080418172631. So, something has stopped working after this issue was first solved.
{code}
for(a <- Some(1);
b <- Some(2);
c <- Some(3);
d <- Some(4);
e <- Some(5);
f <- Some(6);
g <- Some(7);
h <- Some(8);
i <- Some(9);
j <- Some(10);
k <- Some(11);
l <- Some(12);
m <- Some(13)) yield a
{code}
