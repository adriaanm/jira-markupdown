We've had reports of:

```
We are getting this error from time to time: 
error: trait Test is abstract; cannot be instantiated 
11:09:50 [ant:scalac] @Test def testClientRequestNum = { 
11:09:50 [ant:scalac] ^ 
```

I see the error is similar to one we spotted on a build here: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2107#issuecomment-13408939

The error suggests that the annotation is binding to the wrong symbol on the classpath has the same name.

I can't reproduce it, but I think I've spotted the problem. Can you?

```scala
// need to be lazy, #1782. beforeTyper to allow inferView in annotation args, SI-5892.
AnnotationInfo lazily {
  val context1 = typer.context.make(ann)
  context1.setReportErrors()
  enteringTyper(newTyper(context1) typedAnnotation ann)
}
```
I'm still unable to craft a test to trigger this. My hypothesis is that the field `Typer#context` is mutated between the point when the lazy annotation info is created and when it is forced.

A few breadcrumbs for code that might be of interest:
```scala
    // Namers.scala
    def enterSyms(trees: List[Tree]): Namer = {
      trees.foldLeft(this: Namer) { (namer, t) =>
        val ctx = namer enterSym t
        // for Import trees, enterSym returns a changed context, so we need a new namer
        if (ctx eq namer.context) namer
        else newNamer(ctx)
      }
    }
```

```scala
          // Typer#typeStats
          stat match {
            case imp @ Import(_, _) =>
              imp.symbol.initialize
              if (!imp.symbol.isError) {
                context = context.makeNewImport(imp)
                typedImport(imp)
              } else EmptyTree
```
