As per http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11681631/macro-return-type-and-higher-order-functions:

Macro definition:
{code}
def test(s:String) = macro testImpl

def testImpl(c:Context)(s:c.Expr[String]):c.Expr[Any] = {
  import c.universe._
  val list = reify(List(1)).tree

  val function = reify((x:Int) => x).tree

  val res = 
    Apply(
      Select(
        list,
        newTermName("map")),
      List(function)
    )

  c.Expr(res)
}
{code}

Macro call:
{code}
val list:List[Int] = test("")
{code}

Error message:
{code}
[error]  found   : Any
[error]  required: List[Int]
[error]     val list:List[Int] = test("")
[error]                              ^
{code}
This is the result of typechecking the macro expansion:

{code}
immutable.this.List.apply[Int](1).map[Int, Any](((x: Int) => x))(immutable.this.List.canBuildFrom[Int])
{code}

Interestingly enough, c.typeCheck works correctly producing:

{code}
immutable.this.List.apply[Int](1).map[Int, List[Int]](((x: Int) => x))(immutable.this.List.canBuildFrom[Int])
{code}


As discussed on scala-internals (https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/5mebTX1bqDU/discussion), (a variant of) the problem is even easier to trigger. It seems that {{Any}} should never be used as parameter type.

The following looks like an identity macro but isn't:
{code}
def macroId(arg: Any) = macro macroId_impl
def macroId_impl(c: Context)(arg: c.Expr[Any]): c.Expr[Any] = arg
{code}
for the same reason for which {{def idAny(v: Any): Any = v}} is not an identity function: its argument gets typechecked against {{Any}}.

The correct version of the macro is:
{code}
def macroId[T](arg: T): T = macro macroId_impl[T]
def macroId_impl[T: c.AbsTypeTag](c: Context)(arg: c.Expr[T]): c.Expr[T] = arg
{code}

The problem could be reduced by having the typechecker special-case {{Any}} as a target type, and treating it as {{WildcardType}}. Of course, this doesn't solve the general problem, it just makes it less common; but since using the expected type is part of bidirectional type inference, it seems that a general solution could be quite complex.
This might not be a bug after all, if not a documentation bug. See below.

As Eugene said, macros are not at fault because type inference in this code does the same thing, in all calls to {{map}} - they are inferred as {{map\[Int, Any]}}:
{code}
def id(x: Any): Any = x
id(List.apply(1).map((x: Int) => x))
val foo:Any = List.apply(1).map((x: Int) => x)
println(List.apply(1).map((x: Int) => x))
{code}
However, all that code works!

What strikes me as odd is another thing. Given that {{test}} returns {{Any}}:
{code}
def test(s:String) = macro testImpl
def testImpl(c:Context)(s:c.Expr[String]):c.Expr[Any] = ...
{code}
why should one expect this code:
{code}
val list:List[Int] = test("")
{code}
to work? Why isn't it an error that it compiles, after adding the call to typecheck? Apparently, the macro output can *statically* refine the declared type - but how should this work, are there guarantees on that? I'm not sure anymore that this is a bug - unless you can point me to an explanation for users of how things are supposed to work, we might have a documentation bug here.
For another fascinating wrinkle, see https://github.com/puffnfresh/wartremover/pull/46 .
{code}
class A {
  def f1 = Vector(1,2,3) == List(1).map(_ + 1)
  def f2 = Vector(1,2,3) equals List(1).map(_ + 1)
}
{code}
The first map call infers List[Int] for the type argument, the second infers Any. Since I had already observed that arguments to overloaded targets are typed more accurately than arguments to not-overloaded targets, I looked and indeed 'def ==' is overloaded between Any and AnyRef whereas 'def equals' is overridden in AnyRef.
Funny, I noticed that overloading a few days back in SI-8219.
