Still digging.

Here's a smaller repro:
```scala
trait Flow[-In, +Out] {
  type Repr[+O] <: Flow[In, O]
  def map: Repr[String]
}

class Test {
  def slowFlow(f: Flow[String,String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]) = {
    f.map
  }
}
```

As @odersky noted on the mailing list, this typechecks promptly in dotty. We've must have some exponential performance bug in scalac.
