```scala
Scala code runner version 2.7.2.final -- Copyright 2002-2008, LAMP/EPFL
```

When file `bar.scala` below is compiled after `foo.scala`, the compiler throws an exception.

```scala
// foo.scala
trait Foo {
    def foo(arg: List[_])
}
trait FooImpl extends Foo {
    def foo(arg: List[_]) {}
}
trait AbstractOverrideFoo extends Foo {
    abstract override def foo(arg: List[_]) {
        super.foo(arg)
    }
}
```

```scala
// bar.scala
object Bar {
    val a = new FooImpl with AbstractOverrideFoo
}
```

To reproduce:

```scala
$$ scalac foo.scala
$$ scalac bar.scala
```

This exception does not occur if the two files are compiled in a single invocation ...

```scala
$$ scalac foo.scala bar.scala
```

... or if the existential wildcard is replaced with a concrete type such as `Any`.
I could not reproduce this. It might be that it's fixed by now, or else that there
were some junk classes in the empty package that caused the problem. Trying with a clean empty package (i.e. delete all .class files directly on you classpath), everything compiled fine.
I've reproduced this in the past, and can still do so with 2.7.5, but it does appear fixed in trunk.  Looking at the error, I think it was fixed with #715.
```scala
$$ scalac27 bar.scala 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: malformed Scala signature of AbstractOverrideFoo at 579; reference type _$$1 of method foo refers to nonexisting symbol.
