```scala
object Main extends App {
  class A(val i: Int)
  object A {
    implicit def A(i: Int): A = new A(i)
    //    implicit def withA(i: Int): A = new A(i)
  }
  import A._
  1.i
}
```

```
[error] /tmp/rendererFYbR1CBqUc/src/main/scala/test.scala:12: value i is not a member of Int
[error]   1.i
```

it was working in 2.9.x
```scala
object Main extends App {
  class A(val i: Int)
  object B {
    object A {
      implicit def A(i: Int): A = new A(i)
      //    implicit def withA(i: Int): A = new A(i)
    }
  }
  import B.A._
  1.i
}
```
if object A is not in scope - it works
```scala
object Main extends App {
  class A(val i: Int)
  object A {
    def A(i: Int): A = new A(i)
  }
  import A._
  A(1).i
}
```
fails with 
```
[error] /tmp/rendererFYbR1CBqUc/src/main/scala/test.scala:11: Main.A.type does not take parameters
[error]   A(1).i
```
in both 2.10.x and 2.9.x 
so it looks like incosistency between implicit and regular method resolution was fixed in 2.10 but this leads to more confusing results, doesn't it?
shouldn't def A be considered if object A is not applicable?
This is how it works now; it won't call the implicit unless it is visible by its simple name. See #4270.
It isn't ambiguous, because defined beats imported in the same scope. It is ambiguous if the definition is in an outer scope.
```scala
object Main extends App {
  class A(val i: Int)
  object A {
    def A(i: Int): A = new A(i)
  }

  {
    import A._
    A(1).i
    // ./a.scala:12: error: reference to A is ambiguous;
    // it is both defined in object Main and imported subsequently by
    // import A._
    //     A(1).i
    //     ^
    // one error found
  }
}
```
