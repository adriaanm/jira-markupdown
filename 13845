Neither or both of the following should work, but having one working and not the other is inconsistent:
```scala
scala> new Array[AnyVal](2)   
res0: Array[AnyVal] = Array(null, null)

scala> res0(0)
res1: AnyVal = null
```
```scala
scala> val x : AnyVal = null 
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Null(null)
 required: AnyVal
       val x : AnyVal = null
```
