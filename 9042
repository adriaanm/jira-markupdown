I wrapped my head around this on the plane today when I ran smack into it. It is a big problem for my plans. We have to fix it one way or the other. And my test case is a regression from 2.9. Clearly it was going to hit us one way or another, but it's still a regression.
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.BitSet
import scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom

object Test {
  def builder[A, CC[X] <: TraversableOnce[X], Coll](xs: Coll with CC[A] with AnyRef)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[_, A, CC[A]]) = cbf()

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println(builder(null: BitSet) += 1 result)
  }
}
{code}
