The following produces a confusing error message:

```scala
trait Sys[ S <: Sys[ S ]] { type Tx; type Ref[U] }

trait A[ S <: Sys[ S ]] {
   def test( u: S#Ref[ Int ]) : Unit
}

class B[ S <: Sys[ S ]] extends A[ S ] {
   def test( u: S#Ref[ Int ])( implicit tx: S#Tx ) {}
}
```

The compiler not only says `"error: class B needs to be abstract, since method test in trait A of type (u: S#Ref[Int])Unit is not defined"`, but also `"(Note that S#Ref[Int] does not match S#Ref[Int]: their prefixes (i.e. enclosing instances) differ)"` -- it took me a while till I figured out that the latter message is not true, and that the real problem just is that I missed the second implicit argument list in the base trait `A`.
