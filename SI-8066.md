There are some macro-induced compiler crashes in SuperAccessors, LambdaLift and GenICode (some of those documented at https://github.com/sbt/sbt/commit/3b213e59caafdc3b28bfbaf124e80a4584caf3aa) that we can easily avoid by providing a sanity-checking traverser for macro expansions. I will get to that this week.
Also see https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5755
There's a really funny effect that happens when someone tries to return a statement (e.g. a MemberDef) from a macro impl. Then the macro engine says:

{code}
Test.scala:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : <notype>
 required: Any
Note that <none> extends Any, not AnyRef.
Such types can participate in value classes, but instances
cannot appear in singleton types or in reference comparisons.
  Macros.foo
         ^
one error found
{code}

This should be caught by the validator. Also, it would be useful if the validator could tell people that such code doesn't make sense anyway, because the expanded definition is going to be local.
Something to keep in mind given our recent untypecheck idea (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/TtCTPlj_qcQ): https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7516 + https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/83c9c764b5
