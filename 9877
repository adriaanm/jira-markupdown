I'll need some info, since the use case was just to default to :line behavior, which is to put the lines at the end of history so at least you can up-arrow to them.
```scala

1441  val i = 8
1442  :hi

scala> :ed 1441-
Placing text in recent history.

scala> :hi
[snip]
1441  val i = 8
1442  :hi
1443  :ed 1441-
1444  val i = 8
1445  :hi

scala> :q
apm@mara:~/tmp$ echo $EDITOR

apm@mara:~/tmp$ 
```

Maybe the EDITOR isn't actually unset, but is garbage? etc.
