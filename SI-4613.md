The following incurs a compile-error.

```scala
class WeakInferenceTest {

    class A[T]

    class B
    object B {
        implicit def fromA(a: A[Int]): B = new B
    }

    val x: B = new A[Int] // ok
    val y: B = new A // no
}
```

```
[error]  found   : WeakInferenceTest.this.A[Nothing]
[error]  required: WeakInferenceTest.this.B
[error]     val y: B = new A // no
```
Three borderline closing reasons, maybe they add up to one.

1) Duplicate of #3346, not exactly.
2) Doesn't look likely to happen.
3) If it is going to happen, it exceeds ticket scope.

I'll put a pointer here from 3346.
