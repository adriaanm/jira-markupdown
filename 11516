Because the difference in efficiency is O(n) vs O(n^2), which is basically the difference between "works" and "hangs" for anything big, and `LinearSeq`'s contract is _specifically_ to have an efficient tail, I think giving up on that is pretty abhorrent.

Deprecating the entire class sounds reasonable.  If I had finished the bytecode scanning stuff I'd know usage stats for it, but I don't ATM.
