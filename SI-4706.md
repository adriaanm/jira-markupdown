PROBLEM: The conversion of unicode literals causes triple-quotes and comments to behave unexpectedly in common use cases:

1) Generating LaTeX (compile error)
   println("""\usepackage{geometry}""") // error: error in unicode escape

2) Windows paths (compile error)
   println("""c:\users""") // error: error in unicode escape

3) Windows paths ("fails" silently)
   val f = """C:\test\uuuFeedUs""" // f is not what the user expects

4) Escape codes in comments (cryptic compile error)
   val x = 1 // using \u000a gives error: value inside is not a member of Int

5) The following is (unintuitive, undesirable?) valid scala code
   val x: String = \u0022A string.\u0022

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

3 backwards-compatible compile flags similar to -Xno-uescape. This will allow source-compatibility since they are optional.

1) -Xuescape-squotes-only that restricts these unicode escape codes to single-quoted strings only. This gets rid of these above 5 undesired outcomes. However, it may interfere with certain libraries that rely on unicode escaping (e.g. scalaz)

2) -X-no-uescape-tquotes that doesn't perform unicode unescaping in triple-quoted strings. This gets rid of the first 3 undesired outcomes.

3) -X-no-uescape-comments that doesn't perform unicode unescaping in comments. This gets rid of the 4th undesired outcome.

Note: I would be happy to implement this solution, provided the change will be accepted into the compiler.


CURRENT WORKAROUNDS:

1) Decompose the string:
   println("""\""" + """usepackage{geometry}""")
2) Use -Xno-uescape. However, this causes it to stop working even inside normal single-quoted strings.

(This issue is a summary of the discussion from the scala-user topic: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-user/UoJ0sUn3yFU/discussion)
This is related to my good old friend #3220. (While I think "removing comments" alltogether might not be the right approach, something sensible should be done...)

Sadly, I have no hopes anything sensible will be done to fix either of these issues.
I would support making no-unicode-translation the default inside triple-quoted strings only.  Having unicode translated is handy for certain * cough * Scalaz * cough * libraries that use unicode characters.  If you want to stick a unicode CR inside your comment, that's up to you.  However, triple-quoted strings are supposed to be *literals*.  The \uABCD thing breaks that expectation spectacularly for e.g. Windows filenames which is exactly the sort of place where you want it to work.

Since Java has no string literals, there are no Java expectations to meet in this regard.

There could be a compile-time flag to turn on unicode escapes even in string literals if you really want it.  Otherwise, this is a gotcha waiting to happen for Windows users.
That isn't really true. Single quotes have escapes of their own -- \n, for one. If you disable unicode escapes you'll notice \u doesn't work anymore anywhere, but \n will still work inside single quotes.
