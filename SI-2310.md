I haven't found a workaround yet, any suggestions?

Tested against 2.8.0.r18583-b20090827020153.
Related to SI-425 and SI-816.  You can infer from their long lifetimes that they haven't gone down easy.  I unraveled the pattern matcher quite a ways but not yet far enough.  Actually if you look in ParallelMatching you will see from the following commented out block that I might be close:
{code}
            // The below fixes bugs 425 and 816 with only the small downside
            // of causing 60 other tests to fail.
            // case _ =>
            //   if (erased_xIsaY || xIsaY && !isDef)  (alts(EmptyTree, pat), subs, None) // never =:= for <equals>
            //   else if (isDef)                       (EmptyTree,           dummy, pass)
            //   else                                  (None,                 None, pass)
{code}
...but I've been working on other stuff.
Just in case anyone is looking for a workaround, you can re-implement pattern matching as a library, at the expense of some ugly type annotations on the list of cases.

{code}
import Stream._

object diyMatcher {
  def crashNoMore[A](lefts: Stream[A], rights: Stream[A]) = {
    val cases: List[PartialFunction[(Stream[A], Stream[A]), Option[_]]] = List(
      {case (Stream.Empty, Stream.Empty) => None},
      {case (l #:: ls, rs) => None}
    )
    (lefts, rights) `match` cases
  }

  trait Matchable[A] { 
    def `match`[B](cases: Seq[PartialFunction[A, B]]): B
  }
  
  implicit def anyToMatchable[A](a: A): Matchable[A] = new Matchable[A]{
    def `match`[B](cases: Seq[PartialFunction[A, B]]) = {
      cases match {
        case Nil => throw new MatchError(a)
        case x :: _ if x.isDefinedAt(a) => x(a)
        case _ :: xs => a `match` xs
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}


Just for fun, this looks even more like the built in match.

{code}
import Stream._
object diyMatcher {
  def crashNoMore[A](lefts: Stream[A], rights: Stream[A]) = {
    (lefts, rights) `match` (
        {case (Stream.Empty, Stream.Empty) => None},
        {case (l #:: ls, rs) => None}
    )
  }

  trait Matchable[A] { 
    def `match`[B](cases: PartialFunction[A, B]*): B
  }
  
  implicit def anyToMatchable[A](a: A): Matchable[A] = new Matchable[A]{
    def `match`[B](cases: PartialFunction[A, B]*) = {
      cases.toList match {
        case Nil => throw new MatchError(a)
        case x :: _ if x.isDefinedAt(a) => x(a)
        case _ :: xs => a `match` (xs : _*) 
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}
Just to note, this has nothing whatsoever to do with Stream (at least if SI-2835 is really a duplicate). At any rate, I reduced it to the following, in my case:

{code}
object CrashTest {
  object Rule {
    def unapplySeq(line: String) = line match {
      case "" => Some(Seq("x"))
      case "." => Some(Seq("y", ""))
      case _ => None
    }
  }
  
  def computeRules(lines: Iterator[String]) = {
    (lines foldLeft ("")) {
      case (acc, line) => line match {
        case Rule(rule: String) => acc // Removing ": String" prevents the crash
        case Rule(rule, terminal: String) => terminal
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}

Noting this was introduced in r18184 which was a stab at fixing SI-1697.
(In r20710) One of those "$$.05 for the bolt, $$50,000 for knowing where to
put it" commits.  Closes SI-425, SI-816, SI-2310, SI-2691.  All credit
for this patch goes to me for having the genius to know when
new eyes were needed (although if you're feeling generous some
could also go to walter korman for the actual debugging and
code writing part.)
