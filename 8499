That's cool!  I updated to scala 2.10.0-M7 and retried:
```scala
scala> def foo() = { object Foo { class Bar { val x = 1} }; new Foo.Bar }
foo: ()Object{type Bar <: Object{val x: Int}}#Bar

scala> foo()
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: .foo()Ljava/lang/Object;
	at .<init>(<console>:9)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:7)
```
Now it typechecks..  but doesn't run.  Is this expected?  Sorry I elided the "new Foo" bit and just made an object Foo.  Doing it the long way also raises an exception.
