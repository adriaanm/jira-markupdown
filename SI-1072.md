Is there something wrong with stable sort, or have I misinterpreted the 
doco/alogirthm (or gone mad):

val v = Array((0,97), (1,98), (2,98), (3,97), (4,98), (5,97), (6,97), 
(7,97))

(note first element of tuple is already in ascending order)

val cmp = (x:(Int,Int), y:(Int,Int)) => x._2 < y._2

(we want to sort by the 2nd tuple element)

scala.util.Sorting.stableSort(v, cmp)

gives me:
                                                             
Array((7,97), (6,97), (5,97), (3,97), (0,97), (4,98), (2,98), (1,98))

Shouldn't the first elements of the tuples still be ascending?

I'm using scala 2.7.1 interactively.
One use of the comparison function was incorrect (the inverse should have been used). So you have not gone mad ;)

Patch attached.
