the other workaround would be to provide an instance of Ordering at Entity:

{code}
implicit object ord extends Ordering[Entity] { def compare(x: Entity, y: Entity) = ??? }
{code}

since values is a SortedSet, that's needed for its canBuildFrom

Stefan, I think we can close, but I'll let you have a second look since you know in more detail what's going on.
