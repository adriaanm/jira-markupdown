=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
:type def foo: Nothing = foo
:type def bar = throw new Exception
{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
{code}
Nothing
Nothing
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===
{code}
Unit
Unit
{code}

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24524-b20110321020039
"Unit" is correct (it is the type of the expression) but I am aware it would be more useful to give the type of the method.
{code}
scala> val x = { def foo(x: Int) = x }
x: Unit = ()
{code}

(extempore in [r25041|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25041]) Now :t types declarations as well as expressions, and cleans up
the output the same way the repl does so stray unsolved type constraints
don't befuddle anyone.  Closes #4391, no review.
