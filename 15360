I have a project with two files. The first file containing a sealed hierarchy of traits and the second file an object with a function that has a match expression. The match expression is not exhaustive.

I created a simple Eclipse project (using the current revision 22026 of the plugin) that contains these two files. When the project is compiled then no "match is not exhaustive" error message is reported.

In another test, I created an sbt project and added the two files. When the "compile" task is executed after a "clean" was done before then also no error message is reported, too. Yet, when the file containing the match expression is touched and the "compile" task is called again, then the expected error message is reported.
