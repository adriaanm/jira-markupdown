Can we have an implicit conversion:

    mutable.Map[String,String] -> java.util.Properties

as there is only a conversion the other way. I can't find anything on here specifying why a conversion as requested is not possible (or undesirable). java.util.Properties is a much more ubiquitous beast than Dictionary and I believe a conversion is necessary!
please submit a pull request
