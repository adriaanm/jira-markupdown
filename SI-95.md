The source code below shows the minimal context that I've been able to extract that demonstrates the problem and is compilable on its own.  Essentially, the problem is that a type is upper-bounded too aggressively in a match-in-match context such that an expression is considered as having type Any where it should have had type Output, and hence the program is rejected as having a type mismatch where it could actually have been accepted as type safe.

```scala

// scalac 2.6.0-final produces an error message for this at '=> Success(so)':
// type mismatch, found: Any, required: Output, but so:Output _is_ knowable

class ParseResult[+T]
case class Success[+T](t: T) extends ParseResult[T]

abstract class Nonterminal[Output] {

  type SubNonterminal = Nonterminal[T] forSome { type T <: Output }

  def parse: ParseResult[Output]

  def parse1(nts: List[SubNonterminal]): ParseResult[Output] =
    nts match {
      case nt::nts => nt.parse match { case Success(so) => Success(so) }
      case Nil => throw new Error
    }
}

```
For future reference, if you instead declare parse1 like this:
```scala
  def parse1[T <: SubNonterminal](nts: List[T]): ParseResult[Output] =
  // def parse1(nts: List[SubNonterminal]): ParseResult[Output] =
```
then it compiles.  Of course those should be equivalent, but as we can see they're not (maybe monomorphic vs. polymorphic code paths?)
(In r22467) Test cases close #13, #95.  No review.

(That's right, multiple two digit tickets.)
