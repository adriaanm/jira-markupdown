{{NumericRange\[Double\].foreach()}} method in exposes different values than its {{apply(idx)}} due to floating point error accumulation. That results in weird behavior if one mixes Traversable-based and IndexedSeq-based apis.

{code:scala}
  val r1 = new NumericRange.Inclusive[Double](1.0, 3.0, 0.2)(scala.math.Numeric.DoubleAsIfIntegral)

  val r2 = new NumericRange.Inclusive[Double](1.0, 3.0, 0.2)(scala.math.Numeric.DoubleAsIfIntegral) {
    override def foreach[U](f: Double => U): Unit = {(0 until length).foreach(i => f(apply(i)))}
  }

  println(s"r1(3)==${r1(3)}, r1.toList.drop(3).head=${r1.toList.drop(3).head}")
  //1.6, 1.59999

  println(s"r2(3)==${r2(3)}, r2.toList.drop(3).head=${r2.toList.drop(3).head}")
  //1.6, 1.6
{code}

I would guess that this and other floating point NumericRange tickets such as SI-8670, SI-8518, SI-9874, and so forth would need to be fixed together as part of a general overhaul to make this code more principled.
Note that there is also some discussion at SI-4042, but that ticket is a mix of issues with NumericRange generally (including Int vs. Long type type stuff) and issues that involve floating point math specifically. (Paul: "These classes are surprisingly subtle", and as an example of what I mean by "more principled", "That said, if I were to do it again I would most likely just wrap an integer basis, so that there is always an underlying range with well defined endpoints and integer step, e.g. 0.0 to 1.0 by 0.01 is represented by MappedRange(0 to 100 by 1, multiplier = 0.01) or whatever")
