Presently, extracting groups from regex patterns in a pattern match requires matching twice:

```scala
val Date = """(\d+)/(\d+)/(\d+)""".r
for {
  date <- Date findFirstIn text
} yield date match {
  case Date(a,b,c) => (a,b,c)
}
```

This can be easily remedied by providing a Regex.Groups object, similar to Regex.Match:

```scala
  /** An extractor object for Matches, yielding the matched groups */
  object Groups {
    def unapplySeq(m: Match): Option[Seq[String]] = if (m.groupCount > 0) Some(1 to m.groupCount map m.group) else None
  }
```

Alternatively, or even in addition, the `unapplySeq` method on a Regex could be thus modified:

```scala
  def unapplySeq(target: Any): Option[List[String]] = target match {
    case s: java.lang.CharSequence =>
      val m = pattern.matcher(s)
      if (m.matches) Some((1 to m.groupCount).toList map m.group) 
      else None
    case m @ Match(_) =>
      Some((1 to m.groupCount).toList map m.group)
    case _ =>
      None
  }
```

This doesn't change the semantics, just avoids rematching. By the way, on a `Regex`'s `unapplySeq`, the `toList` call seems to be unnecessary:

```scala
if (m.matches) Some((1 to m.groupCount).toList map m.group)
```

If the type was changed from `Option[List[String]]` to `Option[List[Seq]]`, one can remove that method.
Hello.

Did I understand correctly that the problem in the first example above is an overhead in the amount of code that needs to be written?
If so, you could do this:

```scala
for (Date(a, b, c) <- Date findFirstIn text) yield (a, b, c)
```
The problem is not the amount of code, but how many times the regex is matched.

In the example you mentioned, for instance, the Date regex will be matched against text, and then the same Date regex will be matched again against the result of the previous match.

In other words, in order to be able to extract the groups one has to match (as in, regex matching, not pattern matching) twice. For heavy duty text algorithms, the main use of regex, that's very bad for performance.

If you still do not understand the problem, please look at the implementation of findFirstIn and unapplySeq, and note the code that is duplicated between them. An optimized code could then be written like this, with the addition of Groups:

```scala
for (Groups(a, b, c) <- Date findFirstMatchIn text) yield (a, b, c)
```
