Quite possibly.  As singleton type inference had already been closed wontfix in SI-1208 and duplicate in others since, I figured why not cover the bases.

You may be interested to know that if you use the right command line options, you can define the method as you desire.  When or if dependent method types will appear for real I cannot say.  And yes, mailing list would be a better place.

% scala -Xexperimental

  // def getZero[E <: Enumeration](enum: E): E#Value = enum.withName("zero")
  def getZero[E <: Enumeration](enum: E): enum.Value = enum.withName("zero")

scala> BugTestCase.correctlyTyped
res0: BugTestCase.Broken.Value = zero
scala> BugTestCase.wronglyTyped
res1: BugTestCase.Broken.Value = null
