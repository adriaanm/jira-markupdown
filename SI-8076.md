```scala
val deps = foo.map{ case (t,i) => q"""val ${newTermName("e"+i)}: GR[$t]"""}
q"def ${name}(implicit ..${deps}) = ..."
```

creates a non-implicit argument list, so basically ignores the implicit keyword.
The way you can do it now:
```scala
val deps = foo.map{ case (t,i) => q"""implicit val ${newTermName("e"+i)}: GR[$t]"""}
q"def $name(..$deps) = ..."
```
Using of inline implicit modifier like the one you've shown will probably be disallowed.
> Is there any other way to splice in a sequence of arguments? It does make the syntax differ from main scala, which is surprising, but you probably have good reasons for it.

You've misunderstood it:
```scala
val xs = (1 to 3).map { i => q"implicit val ${TermName("foo" + i)}: Int" }
q"f(..$xs)" // ok == q"f(implicit foo1: Int, foo2: Int, foo3: Int)"
q"f(implicit ..$xs)" // not ok
```

> Which means compile time, because it is a macro?
At the place you've used a quasiquote an exception will be thrown. If you use quasiquote in a macro this will be an exception thrown within a macro (at compile time).
> You've misunderstood it:

I don't think so. I got that you have to write that. I am only saying, people would expect to have to write

```scala
val xs = (1 to 3).map { i => q"val ${TermName("foo" + i)}: Int" }
q"f(implicit ..$xs)"
```

But have to write
```scala
val xs = (1 to 3).map { i => q"implicit val ${TermName("foo" + i)}: Int" }
q"f(..$xs)"
```

which is not intuitive because it differs from the way you write it in Scala. But I am sure you have good reasons for this syntactic departure.
