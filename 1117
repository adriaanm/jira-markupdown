I very much agree with mgarcia's comment of nine months ago that TreeBuilder.makeFor already does a whole pile of tree transformations and there is no convincing reason we shouldn't add one which has this kind of impact.  Failing agreement on that point, I believe we have a pressing responsibility to clean up the parsing phase and plugin architecture sufficiently that it would be possible to do this transformation with a compiler plugin.
