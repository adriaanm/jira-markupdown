I would expect a char to default to the normal default, namely zero and not '?'.  I.e., same as
{code}
var c: Char = _
{code}
This is not a use case, but should this print null or complain?
{code}
    val junk: Nothing = elided()
    println("Well, "+ junk)
{code}
If it doesn't complain, should the inserted code throw an exception? ElidedToNothingException?

As an aside (or stage whisper), I had expected elision in these contexts to be an error ("or at least a warning," as we say), but now I agree that the "default value" behavior could be useful, perhaps to supply special default values during development.
