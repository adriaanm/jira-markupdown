Oh, and in case it's not clear, that's not the "artist's conception" or anything like that. Those names are obtained from getEnclosingClass and getSimpleName.
```scala
+  def show[T: ClassTag](nesting: String) = showClass(nesting, classTag[T].runtimeClass)
+  def showRef(nesting: String, x: AnyRef) = showClass(nesting, x.getClass)
+  def showClass(nesting: String, c: Class[_]) {
+    print(nesting, c.getEnclosingClass.getName, c.getSimpleName, c.getName)
+  }
```
