when I try to rename a class (or a method) I get the following:
The Refactoring 'Rename Type' (org.eclipse.jdt.ui.rename.type) cannot be performed, since input type 'org.pinky.code.my.listener.Bootstrap' does not exist.

(org.pinky.code.my.listener.Bootstrap is my class)


tried with both maven and normal standard eclipse projects on multiple classes and methods. (The project was compiled successfully before the rename)

eclipse version 3.4
scala plugin version plugin 2.8.0.r17517-b200904016...
os: os x
jdk: 1.5
sdk: 2.7.3
