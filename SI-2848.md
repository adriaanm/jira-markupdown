The parser does not allow a newline after the first argument list in a self constructor invocation, even though it is permitted after subsequent argument lists, and between the `this` keyword and the first argument list.

For example, this compiles correctly:
```scala
class A(a: Int)(b: Int)(c: Int)(d: Int) {
  def this() = this
                 {1}{2}
                 {3}
                 {4}
}
```
However, this reports an error, "missing arguments for constructor A in class A":
```scala
class A(a: Int)(b: Int)(c: Int)(d: Int) {
  def this() = this
                 {1}
                 {2}
                 {3}
                 {4}
}
```
