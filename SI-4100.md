=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
trait B {
  @volatile var x: Int
}

class C1 extends B {
  var x = 1
}

class C2 extends B {
  private var px = 1
  def x = px
  def x_=(v: Int) = px = v
}
```


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

None that I'm aware of. However, one might expect that the volatile annotation on the abstract var means that its implementation should be a volatile. There is no predetermined Java semantics, since Java doesn't have abstract vars.

So, I propose one of the following:

1) when implementing the abstract var, the volatile annotation is silently emitted on the field

2) the compiler complains that the volatile annotation should be included

And in both these cases, the `var` should only be implementable with a field, and `C2` should be an error.

3) it's not possible to declare abstract variables volatile.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Instead, the field `x` in class `C1` does not have a volatile modifier.

```scala
...
const #28 = class	#27;	//  scala/ScalaObject

{
private int x;


public int x();
  LineNumberTable: 
...
```

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: trunk head
  - Java: 1.6.22
  - Operating system: Linux, Ubuntu 10.04
