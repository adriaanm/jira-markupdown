When summing over only one numeric textnode the output is correct: its's the numeric sum of the numeric values. 1 for instance is not converted to 49 but stays 1. But when summing over more than one node, there is a conversion done to the ASCII value (1 is converted to 49, 2 to 50)and these are summed (i.e. 99) or to char it is 'c'.

Another thing is that 
val total2 = (someXML \ "VALUE").text.sum.toString.toInt is generating an error while
val total2 = (someXML \ "VALUE").text.sum.toInt.toString 
is not (it outputs 99)
Error when for the case above
java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "c"

"or 'a'."

Sorry this should be '1' which it is, so it is correct

Is there a way to enforce the summing numerically?


Replying to [comment:2 DaveScala]:
> -But then there is still the inconsistency for the single textnode case with for instance "1". This should return then 49 or 'a'

If you really think there is a bug involving the one-element case, you should produce the code which handles that case differently.  Or does your next comment indicate you realize there is no such issue? In any case please don't reopen this, there's no bug.

  def sum[B >: A](implicit num: Numeric[B]): B = foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)

If 'sum' has to convert a numerical textnode to char array and sum its ascii value then it works correctly but then Scala xml sum function does not work as an Xpath sum function. 
So what I mean is: it works according Scala spec if the above describes Scala spec but Scala spec does not work as Xpath spec.


For instance Xpath expression sum(/X/VALUE) for
 
<X><VALUE>1</VALUE><VALUE>2</VALUE></X>

would return 3 and not 99.
sum evaluates strings that can be evaluated as a numeric as numeric value (even without a scheme ) and summing them acordingly (which makes semantically sense for a sum) but Scala sum is evaluating them as a char array and returns a Char which is odd. You can check this in an XPath expression evaluation tool.
Or you can take an online tool like http://www.xmltools.dk/
If sum in the nodes that sum is evaluating finds a char then an error is generated. So there is no ascii conversion at all in Xpath but an error message

<X><VALUE>1</VALUE><VALUE>a</VALUE></X> generates for the same Xpath expression
Cannot convert string {a} to a double

Xpath function sum see specification :http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#func-sum 
quote:
'All items in $$arg must be numeric or derived from a single base type. In addition, the type must support addition. Duration values must either all be xs:yearMonthDuration values or must all be xs:dayTimeDuration values. For numeric values, the numeric promotion rules defined in 6.2 Operators on Numeric Values are used to promote all values to a single common type. The sum of a sequence of integers will therefore be an integer, while the sum of a numeric sequence that includes at least one xs:double will be an xs:double.

If the above conditions are not met, a type error is raised [err:FORG0006].'

Which make sense for numeric aggregate functions
