Quoth the spec:

{quote}
(6.23) An expression (of syntactic category {{Expr}}) may contain embedded underscore symbols {{_}} at places where identifiers are legal.
{quote}

Does the identifier used as the root of a path of a type in a constructor not qualify for some reason?

(I know, I'm even rolling my eyes at myself a little for wanting this to work, but a spec is a spec.)
I had a feeling that'd be the answer, but I can't figure out why {{x}} in {{x => new x.Bar}} should be a stable identifier and {{_}} isn't. {{x}} is not a member of anything, and the language that defines a stable path seems to only allow members to form parts of a path; but obviously that sort of thing (using parameters or local vals in stable paths) works. Is it just a de facto rule that this courtesy doesn't extend to the placeholder syntax?
