Why does new Atom() pass the typechecker, given that Atom takes exactly one constructor argument?
For the same reason that you can write Some() yet mean Some(()). There's an implicit tupling conversion going on. I don't see what can be done, except change toString
in Atom. I think it's an unfortunate overload (and btw it's not the first time this problem has come up). I refer back to you Burak to decide what to do (maybe dnothing).

Changing the interpreter led to #1404. So we should fix Atom instead.

Nope, that fix broke the handling of Arrays, so these overloaded variants of toString **MUST GO**.
Why should toString be special when it comes to overloading? Why should it be forbidden to overload it? I think something else should be fixed. I do not think one can construct a compelling argument to forbid something that is allowed by the specification.

I think if this method is renamed (for the sake of improved method names, for instance), it should be renamed **after** the overloaded toString case is handled properly. In the meantime, it provides a valuable test case.

It needs to be fixed because having the interpreter simply call toString() results in #1404.  Fixing the problem by casting the argument of toString() to Any first causes pretty printing of arrays to break.  I would personally be happy with the solution of casting to Any first.  So take your pick, remove the overloaded methods or lobby that arrays be fixed. 
I don't see yet there's anything to be fixed in the compiler. These are the rules of overloading resolution. You can get yourself into hot water for any set of rules. The problem is that if you write just toString, both toString() and toString(StringBuilder) are applicable (via closure conversion). Scala's overloading resolution prefers toString() over toString(StringBuilder) (which it should!). However, toString(StringBuilder) is defined in a subclass, so an ambiguity error results.

Generally it is always a bad idea to overload with overlapping instances in subclasses, except if the subclass instance is strictly more specific. In the case of toString maybe the fact that both methods overlap is surprising, but I don't see how we can do anything about it.

So, to reiterate my position from a year ago, it's really toString(StringBuilder) that has to be deprecated and fixed. We should deprecate for 2.7.2 RC4 and keep Geoffreys fix to #1404 rolled back so that arrays still print out correctly. We should remove toString(StringBuilder) for 2.8 and at that time we can finally roll back the fix for #547, which made #1404 fail (because then there won't be a need for the fix).

Pretty convoluted. We could have avoided all of this if we had fixed it a year ago.

As to a replacement: Everywhere else in the libraries, it's addString(StringBuilder)
so I propose we rename it to that.

Burak, how about it?
The given example works since 2.7.1.  This is strange to me, because I could swear I've tried it since then and it didn't work (and 2.7.2RC4 is mentioned above, which would imply it wasn't working in 2.7.1) but that is the situation.  I'm closing this as fixed unless someone would like to offer an example which doesn't work.

OK, here is an example which "works" in terms of not working.
```scala
scala> <xml:group>hello</xml:group>.toString  
<console>:5: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method toString in class Group of type (StringBuilder)Nothing
and  method toString in class Node of type ()String
match expected type ?
       <xml:group>hello</xml:group>.toString
                                    ^

scala> <xml:group>hello</xml:group>.toString()
res1: String = hello
```
As I approached the bottom of the bucket of xml bugs, I came to realize that this toString business was standing in the way of my fixing #1787.  (The generated Select(value, nme.toString_) would fail because of the same ambiguity.) I am not without sympathy for the viewpoint that toString should be overloadable, but this has sat here unresolved forever, nobody has volunteered any plan for addressing the underlying conflict, and I don't think it's sensible to keep inflicting this bugginess on the world just to make a theoretical point.  We know how to fix it, we have the renaming technology.

Fixed in r17619.

The argument-taking versions of toString are now called buildString.  I couldn't call them addString as in the collections classes because Node and friends all descend from Iterable, so I was going to have to override that, but they have differing semantics because of decoding etc -- so I thought it best to avoid it altogether.

Incidentally, deprecating the methods instead of removing them altogether would mean the problem persists until they are actually removed.  I think we should bite the bullet and just remove them.  It's not like it'll be the only breaking change in 2.8.
