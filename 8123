checkcast is an implementation detail, it's not relevant to this bug - checkcast happens whenever it needs to, but if the type of something is "Any" then there's nothing to check.  The bug, assuming it is one, is that the scalac classfile parser doesn't in this case find the applied type argument of an enclosing class.
