Open up the scala REPL and enter the following:

scala> {val queue = new scala.collection.mutable.PriorityQueue[Nothing]; queue ++ List("meep")}

res8: RandomAccessSeq[java.lang.String] = ArrayBufferRO(null, meep)

Imho the null value shouldn't be in the resulting queue.
If the PriorityQueue is not of type Nothing, but of type String, the resulting queue does _not_ contain a null value (just as one would expect).

Affected version is scala 2.7.7
It appears to be fixed in scala 2.8
