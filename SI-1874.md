**Steps to reproduce**

 1. Create a Scala project with the _New Scala Project_ wizard
 2. Add junit (or another library) via the Build path settings
 3. Create a Scala class
 4. Import _org.junit.Test_

After the above I get a **value of junit is not a member of package org** error message. The error appears in the editor but not in the *Problems View* and the file gets compiled (I can see the .class file).

To remove the bogus error message I have to close the editor and re-open it.

**Tested with**

 * SDT version 2.8.0.r17471-b20090410021621
 * Update site: http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-nightly
