Actually: can't I treat this like another Symbol interning cache? Look, I wrote it to be reused:
```scala
/** This is private so it won't appear in the library API, but
  * abstracted to offer some hope of reusability.  */
private[scala] abstract class UniquenessCache[K, V >: Null]
```
IS THIS MY BIG CHANCE FOR REUSE?
