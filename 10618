```
return in lazy vals started to be a problem somewhere between 2.10.0.RC4 and 2.10.3:
https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala/commit/f1bf7aec695c750194ff922733bf773f6ad9f6c8
This change was necessary to migrate to 2.10.3. See for example change in ScImplicitlyConvertible. We got weird compiler errors and after some time we realized what's going on and was able to fix it.
