The docs for DelayedInit says:

{quote}
Classes and objects (but note, not traits) inheriting the DelayedInit marker trait will have their initialization code rewritten as follows: code becomes delayedInit(code).
Initialization code comprises all statements and all value definitions that are executed during initialization.
{quote}

This gives the impression that {{code}} is _all statements_ and so that {{delayedInit}} would be executed exactly once for each instance. If it's not the case, how many times it gets executed?
