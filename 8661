Here are more examples that don't warn, without using exists:

{{
scala> val f = (c: Char) => c == "ooo"
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f = 1 == (_:Char)
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f = "ooo" == (_:Char)
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f = (_:Char) == "ooo"
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>

scala> val f: Char => Boolean = _ == "ooo"
f: Char => Boolean = <function1>
}}

Maybe it's a matter of methods vs. functions?
