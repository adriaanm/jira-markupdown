Methods +: and :+ in collection.immutable.Queue return a Seq. I think they should return a Queue. E.g.


{code}
var q = collection.immutable.Queue[ Int ]()
q = q enqueue 1 // ok but awkward
q += 2 // deprecated
q :+= 3  // error: trying to assign Seq to Queue
{code}

there are many other methods, e.g. padTo, diff, intersect, union that for some reason revert to Seq.
(In r21628) More fully integrate immutable.Queue into collections.  Fixes
issue with return type of methods being Seq.  Closes SI-3297, no review.
