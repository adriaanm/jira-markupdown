I have created a PR with a fix and would really appreciate your feedback, [~retronym], [~ichoran]!

While the underlying problem has rather been avoided (i.e. why is {{HashMap.get}} slower in the first place and why aren't default methods inlined properly, etc), it does seem to resolve the issue of slow {{groupBy}} s.

It's my first Scala PR, all comments are very welcome! :)
