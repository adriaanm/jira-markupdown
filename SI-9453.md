{code:scala}
trait Stuff[A]
def take[A](st: Stuff[A]): Stuff[A] = st

take(??? : Stuff[Nothing])
{code}

Result:

{noformat}
<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Stuff[Nothing]
 required: Stuff[A]
Note: Nothing <: A, but trait Stuff is invariant in type A.
You may wish to define A as +A instead. (SLS 4.5)
       take(??? : Stuff[Nothing])
                ^
{noformat}

The error goes away if either:
* type parameter is explicit (i.e. {{take[Nothing](??? : Stuff[Nothing])}})
* {{A}} is covariant
* {{A}} occurs in covariant position in return type of {{take}} or does not occur at all

As an aside, it's possible to synthesize a type equivalent to `Nothing` which _won't_ cause the typer to retract the solution,

{code}
type ReallyNothing = Nothing { type T = Unit }
{code}

ie. `Nothing` with a dummy refinement. Repl session ...

def take[A](st: Stuff[A]): Stuff[A] = st
 
take(??? : Stuff[ReallyNothing])

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

I have hit this issue also, though my situation is a bit different so I thought I'd add a bit more.

I have a `trait Stream[+F[_],+O]`, where a `Stream[Nothing,A]` represents a pure stream which uses no effects, and a `Stream[F,A]` may request evaluation of `F[_]` effects in between emitting values to the output. The advantage of using `Nothing` to represent pure streams is that normal subtyping will promote that to whatever `F[_]` the context requires, no need for explicit lifting.

The problem is when calling a function like this one:

{code:scala}
def pull[F[_],A,B](s: Stream[F,A])(using: Handle[F,A] => Pull[F,B,Any]): Stream[F,B]
{code}

in conjunction with a polymorphic function like

{code:scala}
def take[F[_],I]: Handle[F,I] => Pull[F,I,Handle[F,I]]
{code}

The issue is that Scala won't infer `Nothing` for the argument to `take` or the `pull` type parameter, which leads to needing to write:

{code:scala}
val purePull = Stream.pull[Nothing,Int,Int](Stream(1,2,3,4))(process1.take[Nothing,Int](2))
{code}

Both those annotations are needed. Not very good. :(

What stops me from directly using the dummy refinement trick Miles mentions above is that I am relying on the fact that `Nothing` is polykinded, but for any type alias one must pick a single kind for it.
