One thing you could try would be to replace:

{code}
package object foo { implicit class RichActorRef(...) }
{code}

with

{code}
package foo
class RichActorRef

package object foo { 
  implicit def enrichActorRef(): RichActorRef = ...
}
{code}

I suspect that will get rid of the duplicate symbol exceptions at the end of your last comment. Not sure if we've got an open bug for that or not, but all the associated code has been rewritten in the new backend in 2.12, so that problem will be gone.
