As [this PR demonstrates](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3275#issuecomment-31986434), there is a race condition when `askTypeAt(pos)` is called on `implicitly[Foo[A]].foo` where `pos` is matches the end point of the former expression. The issue is that the returned Tree is unattributed, which is why the error `No symbol is associated with tree implicitly[Foo[A]].foo` is reported.

I'm going to move the spuriously failing test in `pending`, but would be good to look at it at some point.
