The command-line executables (scala, scalac etc.) contain some workarounds for certain terminals, using stty.  This is in conflict with nohup, which hangs if scalac is used in batch mode (tested on Mac OS X).  The problem can be easily avoided by emitting stty commands only when required -- right now it is done unconditionally for saved_stty.
I did not look very deeply into the scripts, and left the "when required" unspecified.  It can mean two things: (1) only for "scala", but not for the other scripts, (2) uniformly for all scripts when there is a real need for it -- this might be harder to figure out.

For (1) note that bin/scala could also be used non-interactively, e.g. as "hash-bang" line in some executable script.  bin/scala makes this already quite hard: I usually have something like "scala -howtorun:script -nocompdaemon", but if there are more options coming to force it into batch mode it is also OK.

Concerning the "terminal-specific workarounds", I was thinking about things like this (which might be unrelated):

(I have my own problems with bin/scala on Cygwin, but should probably make a specific tracker item, before this becomes a diffuse discussion about all possible problems of the shell script wrappers.)
