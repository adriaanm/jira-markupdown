I am writing a WartRemover plugin - WartRemover is a compiler plugin that runs after the typer phase of scalac. The scaladoc for {{scala.reflect.api.Trees.ImportSelector}} says that the {{rename}} method "Is equal to name if it's not a renaming import." But in fact (for the wildcard import I'm looking at) it's equal to null.
