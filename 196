What's happening here is not what it seems.

{code}
def f(a: String) { }         // this is a concrete method with empty implementation 
def f(a: String): Unit = { } // as is this  
def f(a: String): Unit { }   // but this is parsed as an abstract method and the braces are discarded
{code}

In other words, if you either insert an equals or remove ": Unit" from the code sample, it works as expected.
