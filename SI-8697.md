The following works:

{code}
trait T[_]
sealed trait A
sealed trait C


object A {
  implicit object AA extends T[A]
}

object C {
  implicit object CC extends T[C]
}

object B {
  implicitly[T[A]]
  implicitly[T[C]]
}
{code}

While the the following can not find the implicit T[C] instance:

{code}
trait T[_]
sealed trait A
sealed trait C


object A {
  implicit object AA extends T[A]
}

object B {
  implicitly[T[A]]
  implicitly[T[C]]
}

object C {
  implicit object CC extends T[C]
}
{code}

The only difference is the order of appearance for the B and C objects.
[~retronym] thank you. That's a big help. I've been meaning to add lack of explicit types as a wart:

there are a lot of tickets in this general space; see e.g. the links at SI-9674, SI-3466, etc.
