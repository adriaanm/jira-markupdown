Looking at the scaladoc of todays nightly build (Mar 12) reveals that apparently scaladoc does not show all protected value members. For example, the scaladoc page for `scala.actors.Reactor` does not show its `protected[actors] def exit()` member, which is clearly visible to user-defined subclasses of that trait. Users have to know about this method, since it is part of the user-level API. However, making the method `public` would not be ideal, since the method should not be invoked from outside the `Reactor` (sub-)trait.
This is a duplicate of #3103.
