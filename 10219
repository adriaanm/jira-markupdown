The code that prompted that test:
```scala
    // unlink existing symbols in the package
    for (member <- container.info.decls.iterator) {
      if (!member.isPrivate && !member.isConstructor) {
        // todo: handle overlapping definitions in some way: mark as errors
        // or treat as abstractions. For now the symbol in the package module takes precedence.
        for (existing <- dest.info.decl(member.name).alternatives)
          dest.info.decls.unlink(existing)
      }
    }
```

It only considers the `decls` of the package object, rather than `members`.
