```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_22).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> trait Foo[T] { val foo: T}
defined trait Foo

scala> val unitFoo = new Foo[Unit]{ lazy val foo = println("Unit: called ") }
unitFoo: java.lang.Object with Foo[Unit] = $$anon$$1@882dfc

scala> unitFoo.foo

scala>
```

Expected result is for "Unit: called " to be printed

But not all lazy vals act like this:
```scala
scala> class Bar { lazy val foo = println("hi")}

defined class Bar


scala> (new Bar).foo
hi

scala> 
```
(In r23920) Closes #4047. Review by odersky
That one is actually fixed (well I have slightly more global change but logic is the same). Unfortunately optimizer has a bug and in situation like:
```scala
trait Foo[T] { val foo: T}

class A extends Foo[Unit]{
  lazy val foo = println("Unit: called A.foo")
}
```

the following call is eliminated during dead code elimination:
```scala
val a: Foo[Unit] = new A
a.foo
```
