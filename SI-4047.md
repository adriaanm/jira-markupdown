scala> trait Foo[T] { val foo: T}
defined trait Foo

scala> val unitFoo = new Foo[Unit]{ lazy val foo = println("Unit: called ") }
unitFoo: java.lang.Object with Foo[Unit] = $$anon$$1@882dfc

scala> unitFoo.foo

scala>
{code}

Expected result is for "Unit: called " to be printed

But not all lazy vals act like this:
{code}
scala> class Bar { lazy val foo = println("hi")}

defined class Bar


scala> (new Bar).foo
hi

scala> 
{code}
(In r23920) Closes SI-4047. Review by odersky
That one is actually fixed (well I have slightly more global change but logic is the same). Unfortunately optimizer has a bug and in situation like:
{code}
trait Foo[T] { val foo: T}

class A extends Foo[Unit]{
  lazy val foo = println("Unit: called A.foo")
}
{code}

the following call is eliminated during dead code elimination:
{code}
val a: Foo[Unit] = new A
a.foo
{code}
