Given the following (incorrect) class:

```scala
class Foo extends Function2[Int, Int, Int] {
  def apply(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y
  override def tupled: (Int, Int) => Int = super.tupled
}
```

The 2.9.1 generates the following incorrect and confusing error message:

```scala
[error] /Users/paul/scala/foo/src/main/scala/Foo.scala:5: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : (Int, Int) => Int
[error]  required: (Int, Int) => Int
[error]   override def tupled: (Int, Int) => Int = super.tupled
[error]                                                  ^
```

This is a regression from 2.9.0, which generates:

```scala
[error] /Users/paul/scala/foo/src/main/scala/Foo.scala:5: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : ((Int, Int)) => Int
[error]  required: (Int, Int) => Int
[error]   override def tupled: (Int, Int) => Int = super.tupled
[error]                                                  ^
[error] one error found
```

An SBT project that demonstrates this issue is [checked into GitHub](https://github.com/paulbutcher/baderrormessage). See the correct error message with `++ 2.9.0 compile` and the incorrect one with `++ 2.9.1 compile`.
(extempore in [r25808](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25808)) Fix for error printing regression.

One's devotion to aesthetics must not be allowed to trump one's
commitment to clearly delineated tuplehood.  Closes #5067, no review.
