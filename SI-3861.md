It seems that the self-type annotation shadows constructor arguments.

scala> trait Y
defined trait Y

scala> abstract class X(x: Int) { self: Y => x }
<console>:6: error: not found: value x
       abstract class X(x: Int) { self: Y => x }
                                             ^
{code}

Of course, without self-type annotation, there is no problem,
{code}
scala> abstract class X(x: Int) { self => x }
defined class X
{code}
and curiously there is no problem with 'val',
{code}
scala> abstract class X(val x: Int) { self: Y => x }
defined class X
{code}

This problem, for example, will cause the following unexpected result,
{code}
scala> object X {
     |   val x: Int = 1
     |   trait Y
     |   abstract class XX(x: Int){ self: Y =>
     |     println(x)
     |   }
     |   new XX(2) with Y
     | }
defined module X
scala> X
1
res0: X.type = X$$@1df3082
{code}

For a related issue involving constructor parameter visibility, see SI-3194.

And your ticket made me realize that this bug represents a workaround to that one!
{code}
scala> class A(var x: Int)                                                      
defined class A

scala> class B(x: Int) extends A(x) { def f(z: Int) = this.x = z }              
<console>:6: error: reassignment to val
       class B(x: Int) extends A(x) { def f(z: Int) = this.x = z }
                                                             ^

scala> class B(x: Int) extends A(x) { self: A => def f(z: Int) = this.x = z }
defined class B

scala> new B(10)
res0: B = B@32e6e42e

scala> res0.x
res1: Int = 10

scala> res0.f(-75)

scala> res0.x
res3: Int = -75
{code}
Applying one bug to work around another: that's how we know we're engineers.
I don't see the problems on trunk. I guess it was fixed?
