When trying to flatMap on a List and internally parallelize the computations, the result is non-deterministic:

    val lv = List(Vector(1, 2), Vector(3, 4))
    val ret = lv flatMap {
      tuple ⇒ tuple.par map (_ ⇒ 42)
    }
    println(ret)

But if lv uses another collection (not a List), then it works OK. Here, ret can return a List with a random number of elements (not always 4).
Thanks for the report.

We actually spotted this problem a few weeks ago during a code review and fixed it for 2.11.6 as SI-9126.
