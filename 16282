in the spec section 1.1 (Identifiers) says:
{noformat}
id ::= plainid
     | '\'' stringLit '\''
{noformat}

but stringLit isn't defined anywhere. I think it should be {stringElement} (with the curly braces)

also, unrelated, but in section 1.3 the word "consuctive" appears. I say "word", but it isn't.
