Problem is that because {{String}} has no {{contains}} method in 1.4, the {{String}} is  implicitly converted to a {{RichString}} which does have a {{contains}} method, but that method is intended for sequences.  As such calling {{contains}} in 1.4 means that you are asking if the string contains a given character, which is always false if you give it a {{String}} instead of a {{Char}}.  Is giving {{RichString}} a contains method the correct solution here?
