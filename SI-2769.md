Using Scala version 2.8.0.r20015-b20091205091141 (Java !HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17)

Compile an empty or commented out file A.scala.  Successive compiles recompile A.scala every time.

{code}
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.scala
Recompiling 1 files
$$ scalac -make:transitive A.scala
Recompiling 1 files
{code}
It looks like something changed to suppress the message in this case, but the underlying issue is still there.

If I include another file B.scala:
{code}
object B
{code}

I still get A.scala being recompiled each time in r21627.
