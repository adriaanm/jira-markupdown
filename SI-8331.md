Due to tree re-use under the hood type quasiquotes might match term trees:
```scala
scala> val tq"$a.$b" = q"Foo.bar"
a: universe.Tree = Foo
b: universe.Name = bar
```
This is quite unfortunate and looks like leakage of trees internals on the outside. I'd expect that pattern to only match selections of type members and always extract TypeName as a consequence.
Similarly problematic:
```scala
scala> val q"$foo[..$bar]" = tq"List[Int]"
foo: universe.Tree = List
bar: List[universe.Tree] = List(Int)

scala> val q"$foo(..$bar)" = pq"Extract(a, b)"
foo: universe.Tree = Extract
bar: List[universe.Tree] = List((a @ _), (b @ _))
```
