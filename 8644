While it can't enumerate members of packages in general, it can be done if you make some assumptions about the classloader (See, for example, Spring's [PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver](http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/view/org/springframework/spring-core/3.0.0.RELEASE/spring-core-3.0.0.RELEASE-sources.jar!/org/springframework/core/io/support/PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver.java?format=ok).) 

I don't suggest to offer that functionality out of the box (maintaining and supporting that sort of code is expensive), but you might offer a hook at the point of mirror creation where the caller could provide a package enumerator.
