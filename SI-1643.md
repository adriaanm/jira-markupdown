Code completion in the plugin is completely case-insensitive.  This doesn't match Eclipse's behaviour in Java files where the order on the entries in the popup is case sensitive.  i.e. the popup contains the same items regardless of case but the lower case items are at the top if the item being completed is lower case and vice versa.

The current behaviour makes code completion much less useful for completing lower case variable and method names because there are always loads of upper case class names to scroll past.  In many cases it's just quicker to type the whole word.
I don't think this is fixed. Tested with the nightly from this morning. Starting from:

{code}
import java.io._

class Foo {
  
  var map: Map[Int, Int] = _
  
  def bar(list: List[String]) {
    m
  }
}
{code}

Press ctrl+space with the cursor after m and Map is suggested before Map.

The JDT suggests map before Map with the equivalent Java file.
Ok, I filed ticket SI-1715 with some additional information to track this.
