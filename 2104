@extempore thanks for responding. Next time could you add a comment instead of editing mine? :D
I've hit this issue myself. Would you perhaps be so kind as to expand the fix? "Your real issue was a lack of variance in FinalResult and BaseResult" -- do you mean if they were covariant this would work? What does variance have to do with the issue, I don't see any subtype or supertype of X anywhere.
