Say an actor is a sink and receives messages from several other actors (e.g., listens to events). Then each actor is allocated the same slot by the executor, which means the other actors will put more messages than those the sink actor can consume. 

{code}
scala> val sink = actor{loop{react{case x => if (mailboxSize > 10000) println(mailboxSize)}}}
sink: scala.actors.Actor = scala.actors.Actor$$anon$1@a1ee92

scala> for (i <- 1 to 10) actor{loop{ sink ! i}}

scala> 10222
45909
82157
...
{code}

Using schedulers is tricky (and i think it does not guarantee the actor will be able to consume all its messages)

There should be a way for an actor to drain its mailbox. IMHO it may also be good to have this as the default behavior: Let the actor's current react handle all the messages that it is defined for before control leaves the actor (if it ignores some messages, they are left in the mailbox)
Using {{receiveWithin}} an actor can drain its mailbox in a way where its thread is not released until the draining is finished:

{code}
def drainMailbox(): List[Any] = {
  var drained: List[Any] = List()
  var done = false
  while (!done) {
    self.receiveWithin(0) {
      case TIMEOUT => done = true
      case x => drained = x :: drained
    }
  }
  drained
}
{code}

However, this method is not very fast. But in some cases it might already be enough to avoid too large mailboxes.

I've also been exploring an alternative which adds a {{protected}} {{drainMailbox}} method to the {{Reactor}} trait and the {{Actor}} object. It converts the mailbox to a list without any synchronization overhead:

{code}
def drainMailbox(): List[(Any, OutputChannel[Any])]
{code}

This would be a very efficient way of handling an overflowing mailbox. We should consider adding something like this to the next non-bugfix release.
