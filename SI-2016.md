Using Scala 2.7.4 final this code below compiles and works as expected when target:jvm-1.4 is set but not with target:jvm-1.5

I get:
{code}
ScalaTest.scala:15: error: overloaded method value execute with alternatives (org.apache.http.HttpHost,org.apache.http.HttpRequest)org.apache.http.HttpResponse <and> (org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpUriRequest,org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext)org.apache.http.HttpResponse cannot be applied to (org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet,org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicResponseHandler)
   	  println(client.execute(method, resp).toString)
                         ^
one error found
{code}
*Code:*

{code}
import org.apache.http.client._
import org.apache.http.impl.client._
import org.apache.http.client.methods._

object ScalaTest {

      def main(args:Array[String]):Unit =
    {
 	  var client = new org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient()
	  val method = new HttpGet("http://google.com")
	  val resp = new BasicResponseHandler

   	  println(client.execute(method, resp).toString)

	}
}
{code}

Note Apache HttpClient, HttpCore, Commons-logging and Commons-codec are required for build.
Am I missing something?
You are wasting everyone's time when you post a bug report which requires half a dozen other jars.  If you're unwilling to distill it to something self-contained you really shouldn't expect someone to do it for you.

The error message says:
{code}
overloaded method value execute with alternatives (org.apache.http.HttpHost,org.apache.http.HttpRequest)org.apache.http.HttpResponse <and> 
(org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpUriRequest,org.apache.http.protocol.HttpContext)org.apache.http.HttpResponse 

cannot be applied to (org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet,org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicResponseHandler)
{code}
So I don't know which of those signatures you think should work, but I bet if you pass the arguments the signature says it requires, you'll get better results.
