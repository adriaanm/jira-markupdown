=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
class Equals2(v:AnyRef){
  def ===(that:AnyRef) =  if(v eq null) {that eq null }else {v equals that}
}

implicit def equals2(v:AnyRef) = new Equals2(v)
//Same with:
//implicit def equals2(v:Null) = new Equals2(v)

null === "Something"
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
{code}
false
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===
{
<console>:23: error: value === is not a member of Null
}

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24736-b20110412020139
OK, but there's a workaround: 

{code}
scala> (null: AnyRef) === "Something"
res0: Boolean = false
{code}


I conclude after briefly implementing this there's no sensible way to do it.  The spec says "A reference to any other member of the “null” object causes a NullPointerException to be thrown." It's hard to imagine anyone lobbying for that behavior as an improvement over the present behavior of pretending Null has no members beyond eq/ne etc.

But we can't pretend Null has no "===" method, which its type clearly indicates it does, and then immediately allow it to be implicitly converted to something else as if it's just another innocent Type minding its own business.  Therefore, I say: wontfix.
