Orderings are PartialOrderings too! But Ordering has a bunch of implicit instances defined on its companion object, whereas PartialOrdering has none. It would be great to be able to use them implicitly as PartialOrderings without having to explicitly import Ordering._.

I propose:

{code}
object PartialOrdering {
  implicit def orderingToPartialOrdering[A](implicit ordering: Ordering[A]): PartialOrdering[A] = ordering
}
{code}
This is tempting, but flawed. Why should {{PartialOrdering}} know about it's subclass? What would be done when a further subclass of {{Ordering}} is introduced?

The implicit scope (of type classes) just isn't cut out for type-class inheritance. A better solution would be to move the definitions from {{Ordering}} into the companion objects of the respective data structures. But even this isn't perfect -- what about {{Ordering\[java.lang.String]}} ?
Why should {{Seq}} know about {{List}}? But when you call the {{Seq.apply}} factory, you get a {{List}}, and we don't stress out over what other implementations of {{Seq}} exist. True, it's not a perfect analogy, as {{List}} doesn't appear in the signature, but I think there's a principle at work here that allows for some classes knowing about the existence of certain of their subclasses. At a conceptual level, I see {{orderingToPartialOrdering}} as a type-class-level factory that provides implicit instances of one particular type sub-class, and yes the signature makes the literal code a little leaky but that's just a necessary artifact of how implicits work.

In any case, the issue I most care about is the practical outcome: in the default implicit scope there are no instances of {{PartialOrdering}}, but lots of instances of {{Ordering}}, which leads me and others to consider using {{Ordering}} in my context bounds even when a {{PartialOrdering}} would suffice. So an {{orderingToPartialOrdering}} view would help with that; so would putting all of the type class instances on the type argument companions (except for the {{String}} problem you point out); so would defining an {{Orderings}} trait, putting all the definitions on that, and having both the {{Ordering}} and {{PartialOrdering}} companions extend {{Orderings}}. Probably there are one or two more creative solutions I haven't thought of. I just think it's a shame to have these nice mathematical type classes floating around in the standard library, one of which is artificially inconvenient to use because the most common instances are all defined on one particular subclass.
The {{Orderings}} approach is problematic, as a search for {{Ordering\[X]}} will consult the companions of {{Ordering}} and {{PartialOrdering}}, and hit an ambiguity.

I've been personally wrestling with these tensions for six months during the Scalaz 7 rewrite. The standard library doesn't have the luxury of backwards-incompatibly reshuffling these implicits, so ad-hoc fixes concern me. (What about conjuring an {{Equiv}} from an {{Ordering}} or from a {{PartialOrdering}}?)

Ultimately, better language support for organizing and discriminating between type class instances might be required. Until then, levying a small import tax seems a reasonable option.
Would one of you terribly mind explaining to me in a bit more detail what the concern is around this ad-hoc solution? Not challenging the decision—I'm quite happy to acknowledge that your instincts are much more likely to be right than mine on this—but I'd like to further develop my own sense of good-Scala/bad-Scala, and I still don't see the relevant difference between {{orderingToPartialOrdering}} and {{Seq.apply}} producing {{List}}&#8203;s. Is there some backwards compatibility issue that I'm missing? Or is it just a general principle of not wanting to invest any sort of effort in addressing a part of the problem if you're currently investing in solving the whole problem?

(If JIRA isn't an acceptable forum for continuing this conversation, feel free to email at ryan.hendrickson (that email symbol) bwater.com. And thanks, if you are willing to take the time to educate.)
Sure thing. It's ad-hoc to provide {{ordering2partialOrdering}} without also adding {{ordering2Equiv}} and {{partialOrdering2Equiv}}. But if we installed all three, we would hit ambiguity for {{implicitly\[Equiv\[String]]}}. As it stands, we haven't found a satisfactory way to use the implicit scope of type-classes that form an inheritance hierarchy.

What about the analogy with {{List.apply}}? This method is not designed for latter extensibility. If I add a new subtype of {{Seq}}, I won't be surprised that it's not chosen as the default implementation by that factory method. But if I add a new subtype of {{PartialOrdering}}, I would like my implicit instances to be in scope when searching for {{PartialOrdering}}. But it's too late -- only the stdlib authors have the chance to add the requisite implicit. So while there is some analog between the two situations, I don't think it's a strong enough link to justify this addition.

Paul's mention of contra-variance describes the other axis of the conflict between type classes and subtyping -- how to pick the most specific instance when the classified type is part of an inheritance hierarchy: if the type class is contra-variant, {{Order\[Fruit]}} is seen as more specific than {{Order\[Apple]}}.

I've got some more detailed notes on the gory details that I've been meaning to publish.
Yeah, I understood that implicit resolution wouldn't be extensible with {{orderingToPartialOrdering}}; it just seems like not such a bad thing. As things are, you have to pay the import tax for both standard lib stuff and external stuff; with {{orderingToPartialOrdering}}, you'd still have to pay it for external stuff but standard lib stuff would come for free. Seems strictly more useful, if not particularly elegant. But it sounds like your point is that there's an expectation that anything having to do with implicits should be homogeneously extensible, and since there's no good way to do that right now, it's less surprising to do nothing; is that right?

I hadn't thought of the problem with ambiguous conversions for {{Equiv}}, but as long as the inheritance hierarchy is linear, we could get away with omitting {{ordering2Equiv}} and letting the other two views chain, right? But then I guess you'd object that as soon as we come up with any other type class that extends {{Equiv}} or {{PartialOrdering}}, that sets us up for either conflicts or having to choose one favored branch of the inheritance tree for the implicit walk... yeah, that'd be pretty gross. But on the flip side, Paul's comment makes it sound like nobody's going to touch this inheritance hierarchy until we have some kind of holistic solution, so... does it matter that much?

The contravariance problem is interesting, but I don't really see how it's relevant to this, other than that they are both interesting unsolved problems involving inheritance and type classes.
