It's easiest to just look at the attachment in order to understand the problem.

The Java class *my.test.bl.bo.CashDrawer.getDrawer()* is returning a type of *my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer*. Scala thinks it's returning a type of *my.test.bl.bo.Drawer* even though *CashDrawer* specifically imports *my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer*.

{code:title=CashDrawer.java}
package my.test.bl.bo;

import my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer;

public class CashDrawer {
    public static Drawer getDrawer() {
        return new Drawer();
    }
}
```scala

Scala will interpret it correctly only if the type names are all fully qualified.

{code:title=CashDrawer.java}
package my.test.bl.bo;

public class CashDrawer {
    public static my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer getDrawer() {
        return new my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer();
    }
}
```
This bug is a consequence of scalac reusing the Scala typechecker to analyze Java source files, given the difference binding precedence rules:

Java Spec:
```
A single-type-import declaration d in a compilation unit c of package p that imports
a type named n shadows, throughout c, the declarations of:
• any top level type named n declared in another compilation unit of p
• any type named n imported by a type-import-on-demand declaration in c
• any type named n imported by a static-import-on-demand declaration in c
```

Scala Spec:
```
Bindings of different kinds have a precedence deﬁned on them:
1. Deﬁnitions and declarations that are local, inherited, or made available by a
package clause in the same compilation unit where the deﬁnition occurs have
highest precedence.
2. Explicit imports have next highest precedence.
```
