I'm not sure if the ticket is calling for EBNF or just that printable gets its own entry in the list of character classes, where opchar uses it. opchar also appears in EBNF in the summary, but only in that prose list in the main text. Similarly everything in that list.

Printable also figures into the definition of blank line and multiline string.

It would be great to sync the summary <==> main text snippets. That would guarantee everything appears in both places somewhere.

Since many alternative productions appear in different sections of the text, I've always consulted the summary. But I've wanted the ability to follow a link back and forth. And searching into the summary is not trivial.
