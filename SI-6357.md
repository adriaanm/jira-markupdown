object K {
   def q = {
      final class Y(val j: Int) extends AnyVal
      3
   }
}
```scala

```
K.scala:3: error: recursive method q needs result type
      final class Y(val j: Int) extends AnyVal
                  ^
{code}

If the result type of q is explicitly annotated, the expected error message "value class may not be a local class" results.
Paul's patch also avoids a crash on this code, reported by Mirco in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/Cp-YuueuqAs/JvSU9LncdjwJ

```scala
object Foo {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = execute {
    class VInt(val v: Int) extends AnyVal
  }

  def execute(body: => Unit): Unit = body
} 
```

Is this something we want to support in 2.10.0?
fixed in master by https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1626
backport for 2.10.1 pending as https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1647
