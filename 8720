@Andrew:

Indeed, scala-swing's dependency on scala-actors is an historical accident. I've raised SI-6441 to remedy this.

Rather than depending on that actors JAR, you could change your code from:

{code}
import scala.swing._
import javax.swing.SwingWorker

abstract class SwiWorker[T] extends SwingWorker[T,AnyRef] 
{code}

To:

{code}
import scala.swing._

abstract class SwiWorker[T] extends javax.swing.SwingWorker[T,AnyRef] 
{code}

This will stop the compiler from searching for `SwingWorker` under the wildcard import `scala.swing._`.

This would also work:

{code}
import scala.swing.{SwingWorker => _, _}
import javax.swing.SwingWorker

abstract class SwiWorker[T] extends SwingWorker[T,AnyRef] 
{code}
