When Scala's actors are run, the context class loader and the access control context in force are determined by the state of the virtual machine when the thread on which the actor is scheduled was created, but the programmer has no control over that except by providing a complete scheduler implementation.

Thus it may happen that within a single actors event loop the context class loader and the access permissions of the code change "randomly". This situation is extremely suboptimal.

I suggest the attached patch to the standard library or some similar approach associating a context class loader and an access control context with each actor.
First, thanks for your patch.

I am aware that thread-specific properties such as the context class loader are not correctly maintained over runs of a single actor, for the reasons that you mention.

However, I did some experiments with your patch (and variations of it), and it turns out that adding support for access control contexts has a major impact on performance: running the {{message.scala}} example (in {{docs/examples/actors}} in the dist) results in a slow-down of a factor of 2! (Running on Sun's 1.6 JVM.)

Since actors are being used for highly performance-sensitive applications, I conclude that putting the additional bookkeeping directly into [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/branches/2.7.1/src/actors/scala/actors/Reaction.scala scala.actors.Reaction] is a bad idea. Instead, it would be better to define subclasses of {{scala.actors.Actor}} that have this additional functionality. Currently, this is difficult to do; therefore, we should have a more modular architecture that let's you customize actor executions in ways such as what you are proposing.
I agree that performance may be more important for the actors framework than classloader or access control behaviour that works the same way as with Java threads.

I just think it is quite important that the behaviour of these aspects of the actors library are somehow specified and deterministic. The way it currently works can lead to bad surprises when you start an actor at an unfortunate place in your program.

Making it easier to extend the actors library with own classes also sounds like a great idea â€“ apart from the thread setup there are other places that would be interesting to adapt to application needs, for example the remote message transport system :-)

Nice solution, thank you :-)
