While trying to figure out how to parallelize a moderately tricky algorithm which leverages Stream, I ran into this compiler problem (at least, I assume it is a compiler problem; maybe I just need to increase the heap size? I doubt it.)

There's a reproduction case here: https://github.com/ebowman/bridge/tree/parseq-compiler-crash

On this branch I introduced some 'par' and replaced some Stream's with ParSeq's to cause the issue.

Thanks,

Minimized.
```scala
(for (x <- (1 to 10)) yield { if (x % 2 == 0) Nil.seq else Nil.par }).flatten
```
There seems to be something more serious here, because it is looking for an implicit view from an inferred refinement type, which seems expensive.

1) Inferred type of the for comprehension is GenSeq { long list of decls }
2) The call to flatten requires an implicit A => TraversableOnce[B]
3) The inferred type from 1) enters implicit search as the "A" without any further processing.

Shouldn't the refinements be stripped, or at least pruned?
Also, the loop it is entering is trying to print the error message for not having found the implicit argument to flatten.  There's a whole other bug here:
```scala
scala> ((for (x <- (1 to 10)) yield { if (x % 2 == 0) List(x).seq else List(x).par }): GenSeq[GenSeq[_]]).flatten
<console>:9: error: No implicit view available from scala.collection.GenSeq[_] => scala.collection.TraversableOnce[B].
              ((for (x <- (1 to 10)) yield { if (x % 2 == 0) List(x).seq else List(x).par }): GenSeq[GenSeq[_]]).flatten
                                                                                                                 ^
```

1) "TraversableOnce[B]" shouldn't appear in an error message.  B is type parameter.
2) In theory at least it should compile.
(prokopec in [r25258](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25258)) Fixes #4761.

This changes the signature of flatten - I do not see how to use a @bridge annotation here, since after erasure both the bridge and the original method have the same signature.
