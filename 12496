Some of the hoops people jump through to try to do this themselves:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21041626/chaining-partialfunctions-with-andthen-in-scala

For what it's worth, I typically provide

{code}
def composePartial[A, B, C](left: PartialFunction[A, B], right: PartialFunction[B, C]): PartialFunction[A, C] = {
  def isDefinedAt(a: A): Boolean = left.isDefinedAt(a) && right.isDefinedAt(left(a))
  def apply(a: A): C = left(right(a))
}
{code}

at the call site and just hate myself.
