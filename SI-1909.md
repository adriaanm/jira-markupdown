While it may appear perverse to define functions inside a block just to pass a parameter to the primary, the motivation is noble - it avoids the creation of unwanted long term storage associated with intended-to-be-temporary values.  Presently this is nearly impossible to do without using an external def somewhere (if one can afford to recalculate the value repeatedly) or ending up with extra fields.

See http://www.nabble.com/Temporary-Values-in-Constructors-Retained-As-Fields-td22526316.html for background.
It is perverse. Unfortunately, it is not easy to fix. If anyone feels like providing a patch...

The problem is that a local method needs to be lifted, and right now all such methods are lifted to the enclosing class. But the JVM forbids calls to virtual methods on uninitialized instances. Here's the relevant code after lambda lifting:

{code}
   def this(): Foo = {
      Foo.this.this({
        Foo.this.bar$$1()
      });
      ()
    };
    final private[this] def bar$$1(): Int = 5;
{code}

`Foo.this` is uninitialized before the call to another constructor, so we cannot call any methods on it. Some creative hacking could work around it when the defined method does not reference 'this', and make it a static method, or move it to another class. 
See also SI-2508, which I closed as a duplicate of this.
...I take that back, SI-2508 is but I missed this.  It might be shortly.

Wow, that is all it takes to get that result? That was my plan too but I had no idea it could be done so smooooothly. Thanks.

Your pessimism was well founded, see SI-3832!
