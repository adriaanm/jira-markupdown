I'm not quite sure what you are trying to argue. From the last time I tried it, I think I remember that a valid Scala file was also a valid Scalite file. Which issues did you find?

From the docs:

bq. Notably, the fact that Scalite only special-cases lines which do not end in a { means that old-fashioned curly-brace Scala continues to function perfectly fine, and can be mixed together with Scalite code in the same source files and still compile without issue.
