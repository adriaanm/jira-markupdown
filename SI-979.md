apply is missing method in Iterator: there is no other way to take n-th element of iterator.

{code}
  def apply(n: Int) = {
    require(n >= 0)
    var remaining = n
    while (remaining > 1) {
      next
      remaining -= 1
    }
    next
  }
{code}

However, adding this method breaks source compatibility in several places, for example !RichString should be changed:

{code}

       index += 1
       self.substring(start, index min len)
     }
{code}

If someone accepts this task, I'll also change all places in standard library that apply method breaks.
Actually there is a way.  You drop(n) and then take the next element.  Thus, the method is not needed for practical concerns.  It might be desirable from a design point of view, but I don't yet see it.  At any rate it needs to be considered as part of a general consideration of the library's API.
