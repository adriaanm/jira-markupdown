"I think we should add some partest setting tests so we avoid breaking each other!"

Well yeah, we should have done that five years ago.  As always, the obstacle to script tests (which is the meaningful way to test command line properties - from the command line) is windows.  Whenever I have tried to check in anything in this area, I have had to revert it. I no longer try. For the glory of windows, we have no tests here for anyone.
