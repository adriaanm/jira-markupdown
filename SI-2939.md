Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.Beta1-RC8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).

scala> class C extends collection.MapProxy[Int,Int] { def self = Map[Int,Int]() }
<console>:4: error: class C needs to be abstract, since method - in trait MapLike of type (key: Int)scala.collection.Map[Int,Int] is not defined

r18035 appears to be a partially-finished attempt to address this, but I don't see a ticket for it.

(In r22024) Brought the *Proxy classes more up to date.  Closes SI-2939, no review.
