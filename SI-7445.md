Use REPL:
val a = scala.collection.immutable.ListMap[Int,Int] = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4, 5 -> 5)

a.head: (Int, Int) = (1,1)
a.tail: scala.collection.immutable.ListMap[Int,Int] = Map(1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4)
Note that this is the underlying cause of a rather debilitating problem in the IntelliJ debugger:

I don't know whether Eclipse and Netbeans have the same problem.
OK, the way I see it there are two options: 

a) remove the .toList.reverseIterator. That would make tail agree with the rest of the operations again and would also be a large performance improvement, since .toList.reverseIterator allocates 2 N objects *every time you iterate over the collection* or even in the case you only need the first element (e.g. head). It would also bring ListSet and ListMap in sync again. But obviously this changes the order in which the elements are presented in all operations. The documentation says nothing about order, but one reason why people use a ListMap is that they want to preserve order. 

b) revert the commit and rework the place in HashMap where I rely on ListMap.tail being O(1)
