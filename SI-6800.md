With Scala 2.9.2 you could extend a scala.xml.Node and create your own class. When you use toString, the default case would print out the custom Node much like an Elem, since this was the catch all implementation. 

Since this commit (see src/library/scala/xml/Utility.scala): https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/e7ea29cc0b3c55d7880b767f8c442d8bf3cd0dea

The behavior changed to printing Elem and throwing an exception when it was not one of the known sub-classes of Node. 

This means the user can no longer extend the XML hierarchy with his own classes and use toString, since any XML tree that includes custom classes extending Node will throw exceptions on a toString.
