There was no test case checked in, a prerequisite to the fact that this bug is still with us.  res0.invoke(x, Nil: _*) still crashes as of r24610, as does res0.invoke(x, Seq(): _*).

Here is a test case with both crashers for the convenience of the eventual closer.
{code}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = "abc"
    val m = x.getClass.getMethod("toString")
    m.invoke(x, Nil: _*)
    m.invoke(x, Seq(): _*)
  }
}
{code}
