The summer SLIP meeting dealt with backticked idents ([summery summary|http://scala-lang.org/blog/2015/07/26/sip-slip-summary-july-2015.html]) and Martin bemoaned underscores in the idents (that people wanted them when they weren't supposed to be there, then that they'd leaked into the implementation, where naughty people might be tempted to exploit them).

Since leading underscore is disallowed, it's clear that embedded underscore must also be disallowed, as specified by the SIP.

The implementation for loosening (interpolated idents are just idents, basta) was [here|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4663].

Since liberals have taken over Canada, this PR is a reactionary attempt to take back some ground. Close the borders. Batten down the hatches. All those Canadiens will try to get in now. Martin was so right. It starts with underscores, but ends in anarchy.
