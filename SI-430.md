Attempting to compile the following file:

```scala
package a.b.scala
case class Test[T](t : T)
```

gives this error:

```scala
test.scala:2: error: type Nothing is not a member of package a.b.scala
case class Test[T](t : T)
                ^
one error found
```

Also occurs if the case class is in package a.b and package a.b.scala is defined.

Tested against rev 13855

```scala
// Compiles
package a {
  case class A[T]
}

}

// Doesn't compile: type Nothing is not a member of c.scala
package c.scala {
  case class C[T]
}

// Doesn't compile: type Nothing is not a member of d.scala 
package d.scala.d {

}

// Doesn't compile: type Any is not a member of e.scala

  case class E[T >: Nothing]
}

This might be related:

```scala
// Doesn't compile: type <byname> is not a member of package h.scala
package h.scala {
  case class H(s: String)(t: =>String)
