Consider this minimal example:

{code:scala}
import scala.language.reflectiveCalls

class A

trait MyTrait {
  def obj: A
}

object Main extends MyTrait {
  lazy val obj = new A {
    def x = 42
  }

  println(obj.x)
}
{code}

While this compiles correctly in Scala 2.11.8, I'm getting the following error in Scala 2.12.0:

{noformat}
[error] /scala-test/test.scala:14: value x is not a member of A
[error]   println(obj.x)
{noformat}

I read the breaking changes in Scala 2.12 release notes and I couldn't find anything related to this. I tried adding more fields and methods to {{MyTrait}} to be sure SAM conversions wouldn't apply, but the error persists.

Is this an intended breaking change or a bug? Is there an workaround?
