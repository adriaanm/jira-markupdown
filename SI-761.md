They're currently using the default case class implementations for equals and hashCode. This means that they don't get tail call optimised and can and will stack overflow for only moderately large lists.

This is sad.
I've reimplemented equals and hashCode for List.

hashCode is implemented in Seq compatibly with java.util.List.

Tests (each line yields true)

{code}
(1 to 100000).toList.hashCode == -811353775

{ val a = new java.util.ArrayList[Int]; (1 to 100000).foreach(a.add(_)); a }.hashCode == -811353775

Nil.hashCode == 1

new java.util.ArrayList[Int].hashCode == 1

(1 to 100000).toList == (1 to 100000).toList

(1 to 100000).toList != (1 to 100001).toList

Nil == Nil

Nil != List(1)

List(1) != Nil
{code}
Looking good in new collections.
{code}
scala> (1 to 10000000).toList == (1 to 10000000).toList
res0: Boolean = true
{code}
