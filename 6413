There is no constructor invocation in this code.  The compiler is the only one throwing around constructor invocations.  As far as the author of the code is concerned, it's two method calls. At the point where the compiler should be inserting a constructor call, it does have a stable prefix: "this".
```scala
object O {
  // error: C is not a legal prefix for a constructor
  C().CC()
}
```
(From the example in my most recent comment containing code.)
