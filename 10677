Well, if I actually do it exactly the way shown it doesn't work, but at least it's not a crash anymore:
```scala
15:53:54 $ scalac dollar.scala
15:53:58 $ scala
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_92).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> import dollar.$
import dollar.$

scala> $.Two()
error: Unable to locate class corresponding to inner class entry for Two$ in owner dollar.One
```
