Why is IterableLike.sliding defined with a type parameter B? It is never used:

def sliding[B >: A](size: Int, step: Int): Iterator[Repr] =
  for (xs <- iterator.sliding(size, step)) yield {
    val b = newBuilder
    b ++= xs
    b.result
  }
Yeah, if you guys are wondering where the type parameter came from, know that sliding originated in Iterator and you can't remove the type parameter from that one because of how it's used over there.
