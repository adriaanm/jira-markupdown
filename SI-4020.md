Try to compile the code below:
```scala
package tmp;

class A {
    sealed trait Foo
}

object a1 extends A {
    case class Foo1(i: Int) extends Foo
}

object a2 extends A {
    case class Foo2(i: Int) extends Foo
}

class B {
    def mthd(foo: a2.Foo) = {
        foo match {
            case a2.Foo2(i) => i
            
            // Note: This case is impossible.  In fact, scalac 
            // will (correctly) report an error if it is uncommented,
            // but a warning if it is commented.
            
            // case a1.Foo1(i) => i
        }
    }
```

You will receive a warning that the match on line 17 is not exhaustive.  However, it is.  Furthermore, the "missing combination" a1.Foo1 is impossible.  The problem of course is that the compiler doesn't consider that a1.Foo1 is not a possible subtype of a2.Foo.

What is the expected behavior?

No warnings.

What do you see instead?

```scala
A.scala:17: warning: match is not exhaustive!
missing combination           Foo1

        foo match {
        ^
one warning found
```

What versions of the following are you using?
Scala: Scala compiler version 2.8.1.final
Java: java version "1.6.0_22"
Operating system: Mac OS X
Sorry for broken WikiFormatting... one brace too many it seems, but I don't know how to edit the entry above.  The correct code to compile is:

```scala

package tmp;

class A {
    sealed trait Foo
}

object a1 extends A {
    case class Foo1(i: Int) extends Foo
}

object a2 extends A {
    case class Foo2(i: Int) extends Foo
}

class B {
    def mthd(foo: a2.Foo) = {
        foo match {
            case a2.Foo2(i) => i
            
            // Note: This case is impossible.  In fact, scalac 
            // will (correctly) report an error if it is uncommented,
            // but a warning if it is commented.
            
            // case a1.Foo1(i) => i
        }
    }
}
```
