For the following snippet, Try fails to catch the exception thrown in the closure passed to mapValues. Expected outcome is that t is bound to a Failure(IllegalStateException). Using map instead of mapValues seems to work as expected.
```scala
import scala.util._

object Test extends App {
  def fail = throw new IllegalStateException
  def attempt(m: Map[String, String]) = m mapValues { _ ⇒ fail }

  val t = Try(attempt(Map("a" → "b"))

  println(t)
}
```
