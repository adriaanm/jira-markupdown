Using the vim syntax from [source:/scala-tool-support/trunk/src/vim], the handling of identifiers is not quite right.

In this snippet, b_ is highlighted correctly as a scalaVarName, but a_ has the underscore highlighted as a scalaKeyword I think.  I hit this in testing out footnote 2 from page 203 in Programming in Scala, which states that `println_` is a valid identifier.

{code}
var b_ = a_
{code}

Adding this line after the `scalaKeyword "_"` one is a temporary workaround (although not unicode-aware).

{code}
syn match Normal "[$$a-zA-Z][$$a-zA-Z0-9_]+"
{code}
