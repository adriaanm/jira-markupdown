Eugene brought up "why not make implicitly a macro" mentioning
```scala
  @inline def implicitly[T](implicit e: T) = e
  @inline def locally[T](x: T): T  = x
```
I threw in some more
```scala
  def manifest[T](implicit m: Manifest[T])           = m
  def classManifest[T](implicit m: ClassManifest[T]) = m
  def optManifest[T](implicit m: OptManifest[T])     = m
  def identity[A](x: A): A         = x    // @see `conforms` for the implicit version

  private[this] final val singleton_<:< = new <:<[Any,Any] { def apply(x: Any): Any = x }
  private[this] final val singleton_=:= = new =:=[Any,Any] { def apply(x: Any): Any = x }

As well as every method of the form

  def foo(implicit x: Bar) = x

such as classTag, Ordering#apply, etc.
```
And I continued to blather in https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/iltzDFqS_ZE/discussion 
```
"Anytime the runtime residue of source code is nothing but a call to one
of our many choices of identity function, it is semantically a compile-time
 construct. The existence  of runtime artifacts is an accident of
implementation and history. Given the power to do so in a principled
way - something we have with macros - we should eliminate all of them."
```
Making implicitly, classManifest, and optManifest macros is unlikely to break code because their argument is implicit and the compiler generates a straightforward, predictable tree for it (as far as I know).  However, users can put any Scala code in the argument of locally.  Because of this, a benefit of making these macros is it will find bugs like #6187.  That might also make it somewhat risky, though.

For identity, it might be more complicated because it is partially applied in practice.  The gain will be that the anonymous class looks like:

```scala
def apply(t: T) = t
```

instead of:

```scala
def apply(t: T) = identity(t)
```

Presumably the real benefit is when the higher order function accepting the partially applied identity is itself a macro or is inlined.
Yes, "we should eliminate all of them" should be read "theoretically, subject to whatever realities stand  in the way." It's less than promising that there could be any complications whatsoever posed by "locally", which is in its entirety
```scala
def locally[T](x: T): T  = x 
```
If you can't write a macro which simply returns x.tree without creating new bugs, it is a severe deficiency in macros.
Is there still any obstacle to fixing this, beyond "macros are experimental so we don't use them in the standard library" (if that's still true â€” StringContext.f in src/library/scala/StringContext.scala seems an exception)? At least #6187 is fixed.
On a completely unrelated note, I think that `StringContext.s` will need to be converted into a macro, too, if we want to have a chance of replacing usages of `any2StringAdd` with string interpolation, due to performance and inlining/constant behavior.

Also, we should probably add `StringContext.r`, using som-snytt's amazing regextractor (https://github.com/som-snytt/regextractor) and get rid of `StringLike.r`.

Mhh, this has become more off-topic than expected ... I should bring this up on the mailing list ...
