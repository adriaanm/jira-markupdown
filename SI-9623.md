*See* [demonstration of the issue|https://github.com/tim-group/iterata/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/timgroup/iterata/MemoizeExhaustionIteratorSpec.scala#L8].

The standard library method `Iterator#++` creates a `JoinIterator`. The `hasNext` method on JoinIterator *always* calls the left iterator's `hasNext` method, rather than remembering that it has been exhausted.

In cases where the left iterator's hasNext method is expensive, such as any kind of IO, this was at the root of a baffling performance problem.

This behavior is fixed in `ConcatIterator`, which never calls the underlying hasNext a second time for an iterator which already returned false. So that provides an easy, if dirty, workaround:

{code:scala}
val it1 = new IteratorWithExpensiveHasNext()
val it2 = new IteratorWithExpensiveHasNext()

// SLOW due to calling it1.hasNext every time
(it1 ++ it2).foreach(_ => ())

// FASTER due to NOT calling it1.hasNext every time
(Iterator.empty ++ it1 ++ it2).foreach(_ => ())
{code}

*NOTE:* you can use `#memoizeExhaustion` from my [iterata|https://github.com/tim-group/iterata/blob/master/README.md#2-memoize-exhaustion-iterator-memoizeexhaustion] project as a workaround, as well.

[~ms-tg], I thought it wouldn't be possible in 2.11 but I'll take another look.
