That's not correct ... the Scala classpath container isn't used by any of the core Scala projects.

Please try configuring your stack and heap appropriately. The following appended to you config.ini should do the trick assuming you have enough physical RAM,

{code}
--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
-vmargs
-Xms256m
-Xmx2048m
-XX:PermSize=64m
-Xss1M
-server
-XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
{code}
