Uh, in what way is it being treated as a function?  It looks like it is being treated like a method to me.

Yes, arbitrary expressions should ideally be usable as statements.  But as I pointed out in scala/bug#1564, the problem is not at all related to how the interpreter is implemented.  The problem is entirely within the parser.
