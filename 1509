Here is actual cause of the bug. Consider:
{code}
package x
abstract class H[A] {
  type P <: R[P]
  def a: P
}
class R[F]
{code}
When generating the signature for {{a}}, the result is "{{()Lx/R<TF;>}}", which is incorrect since F is undefined in H. Something else must replace the "{{TF;}}" in this case, possibly a wildcard "{{*}}".
