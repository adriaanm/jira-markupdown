Martin says:

```
In dotty I propose to no longer allow nested classes with the same name which shadow each other. It's less convenient that way, but a lot safer.
```

instead of:

```scala
trait Core extends Base {
  class Status
}

trait Ext extends Core {
  class Status extends super.Status
}
```

write:

```scala
trait Core extends Base {
  class Status
}

trait Ext extends Core {
  class StatusExt extends Status
}
```
