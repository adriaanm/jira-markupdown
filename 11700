I don't think we can change this under our constraints of backwards compatibility. Within the standard library, potentially infinite concrete collections override `toString`:
```
scala> Stream.from(0)
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(0, ?)

scala> Iterator.from(0)
res2: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator
```
