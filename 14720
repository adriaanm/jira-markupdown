This is an odd problem, since abstract override protected[pkg] works.

Example:
```scala
package pkg1 {
    class C {
        private[pkg1] def foo: Int
    }

    trait T extends C {
        abstract override private[pkg1] def foo = super.foo + 1
    }
}
```
```scala
error: `abstract' modifier can be used only for classes;
it should be omitted for abstract members
```

None of the combinations compile:
```scala
abstract override private[pkg]
abstract private[pkg] override
private[pkg] abstract override
```

Tested on 2.7.7.final and 2.7.3.final with the same result.
