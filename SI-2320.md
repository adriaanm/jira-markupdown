```scala
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18634-b20090902145809 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
```
If source file A.scala has not object or trait or class with name A, ant/scalac task doesn't respect previous successful compiling and, as a result, recompile the source at any case.

I'll attach small ant project to illustrate.

P.S. Not sure which ticket component to use.
In test project there is the only source file HData.scala:
```scala
trait HData

object Another
```
Just try

```scala
ant clean compile compile
```

- last compiling doesn't compile anything. Now comment out 'trait HData' and try above ant call again - last compiling call recompiles the source.
