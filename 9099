The Eclipse Java compiler team found a problem in the classfiles they were generating. It has been fixed in their code base. The fix will be available in the next release version (kepler - 4.3).

One comment which might be interesting for the Scala compiler:
```
[comment #10|https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=398657#c10]
I have to admit that I am pretty disappointed by the error reported by the scala compiler:

org.codehaus.jackson.annotate.JsonTypeInfo$Id while parsing annotations in ../t1402.jar(ide/issue/session/JavaClass.class)
error: error while loading JavaClass, class file '../t1402.jar(ide/issue/session/JavaClass.class)' is broken
(class java.lang.RuntimeException/bad constant pool index: 3840 at pos: 710)
ScalaTest.scala:8: error: ide.issue.session.JavaClass does not have a constructor

This is completely misleading. The problem is a missing inner class info. Not a problem with the constant pool. A better error would have help to diagnose this issue quicker.
```
