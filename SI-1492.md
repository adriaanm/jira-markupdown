Specifically, I would like to be able to do the following:

{code}
val result = higherOrderMeth { implicit a: Int =>
  // do implicit-y things with a
}
{code}

As of 2.7.1, this triggers a parse error.  As far as I can tell, allowing this should not affect soundness and will not introduce any ambiguities in the grammar.

This capability is useful for situations like my implicit STM which uses function values which take implicit parameters.  Without this functionality, every function used in such a fashion must be declared as a full, named function.  This is ugly and too heavily drains the imagination (seeking unique identifiers).
It would also be useful to have this capability in for comprehensions, which for an STM might give something like:

{code}
for (implicit txn <- atomic) {
  // body
}
{code}
Are you suggesting that:
{code}
(implicit i : Int) => {...}
// Or with type inference: implicit i => {...}
{code}
should be equivalent to:
{code}
(i : Int) => { implicit val _ = i; ... }
// Or with type inference: i => { implicit val _ = i; ... }
{code}
If so, I think it's a valuable addition to the language.

This is awesome! Thanks Martin!

If it's not asking too much, can we also have:

{code}
for (implicit a <- ...) {
  ...
}
{code}
This is really cool, but I'm going to be an ingrate and reopen it because it's really hard to use.  I had to analyze the diff to the parser to even figure out what syntax it might possibly accept -- none of my many guesses ever parsed.

Example: I have a method mainMethod which I use thusly.
{code}
    def mainMethod(f: MethodVisitor => Unit): Unit = { ... }

    // from elsewhere
    cw mainMethod { mw => 
      implicit val _mw = mw

      // the methods being called here by way of implicit take an implicit mw
      ("java/lang/System" getStatic "out")
      ("java/io/PrintStream" invokeVirtual "println")("Hello world!")      
      ("java/lang/System" invokeStatic "setProperty")("propfoo", "valuebar")
    }
{code}
So naturally I'd be pleased to be able to write:
{code}
    cw mainMethod { implicit mw => ...
{code}
But that does not parse.  The only way I can get it to parse are when I explicitly type it prior to the parameter being used.  I failed to find any way to annotate the type of the parameter or to use an anonymous parameter.  So here is how it looks if I accept the limitations:
{code}
    val body: MethodVisitor => Unit = implicit mw => {
      ("java/lang/System" getStatic "out")
      ("java/io/PrintStream" invokeVirtual "println")("Hello world!")      
      ("java/lang/System" invokeStatic "setProperty")("propfoo", "valuebar")
    }
    
    cw mainMethod body
{code}
But this is far inferior to the original version.
