Sorry, I should have added that it sounds like we could just pull the rug from under the old getClass's feet and replace calls to it by calls to our runtimeClass, which is like a getClass2.0, and which could thus be called thusly (without the version number). It only adds new behaviour (for AnyVal) and better typing right?
