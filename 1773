This is just the result of an erroneous commit, not a regression (that would be code that builds correctly, but behaves incorrectly). The wrong commit is r17501, in which a patch designed for the 2.7.x branch was propagated to trunk. That has been (temporarily) reverted in r17502; see SI-1882 for further details.
