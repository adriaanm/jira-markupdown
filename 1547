Indeed, I tested it out on the 1.4 JVM and build and didn't have any problems with -Ydebug.  On 1.5 it is clearly trying to use the `contains` method that was added in 1.5, rather than the implicit one made available from the implicit conversion.  This seems like some kind of bug in the implicit resolution logic, so maybe it would be worth filing a ticket related to that.  However, I expect without a more precise example Martin will not really have time to track it down.

I applied the patch in r17012.
