This is a very minor issue.

If we define the following in the REPL
{code}
object Foo { val `1 ?` = () }
{code}
and we type:
{code}
Foo.<tab>
{code}
then "1 ?" is suggested as an option.
If we type:
{code}
Foo.1<tab>
{code}
then this autocompletes to
{code}
Foo.1 ?
{code}
which isn't valid, so ought to complete to
{code}
Foo.`1 ?`
{code}
Interestingly,
{code}
Foo.`<tab>
{code}
will suggest all members of Foo correctly, though (for example),
{code}
Foo.`c<tab>
{code}
appears to search the global namespace, offering suggestions such as classOf, clone, com and collection.
I tried to implement this as part of my recent REPL revamp. See the last commit https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.11.x...retronym:ticket/6919

Still needs quite a bit more finesse.
