According to the new collections document, any Traversable object should support the ++ method.  But the ++ method is deprecated in BufferLike, and the implementation actually appends to the existing buffer rather than create a new collection.

Maybe the intent was to prevent collection implementers from accidentally invoking the ++ method of BufferLike, which would probably be the wrong thing, but the deprecated ++ operator is exposed through the ListBuffer class at least, with the result that invoking ++ on a ListBuffer instance directly generates a deprecation warning and improperly updates the collection, while invoking ++ on any random Traversable instance (which may actually be ListBuffer) is fine and seems to do the right thing.

```scala
scala> val b = new ListBuffer[Int]
b: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer()

scala> b += 1
res18: b.type = ListBuffer(1)

scala> val c = new ListBuffer[Int]
c: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer()

scala> c += 2
res19: c.type = ListBuffer(2)

scala> b ++ c
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
res20: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2)

scala> val t: Traversable[Int] = b
t: Traversable[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2)

scala> b == t
res22: Boolean = true

scala> t ++ c
res23: Traversable[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2, 2)

scala> b
res24: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2)
```

Invoking ++ on a collection is the canonical way to create a new collection that contains all of the elements of the left-hand collection followed by all of the elements of the right-hand collection.  It shouldn't generate a warning and/or work differently just because the left-hand collection type happens to be ListBuffer.

Someone's going to say that Buffer implementations are special because ++ has to return a new instance of the collection type on which it is called, which would be ListBuffer in this case, and which would be inefficient because an entirely new mutable ListBuffer would need to be created.  But that's what the method supposed to do.  There are a million and one ways for a developer to use the collections inefficiently.  The ++ method shouldn't do the wrong thing (appending to itself) because the right thing (creating a copy and appending to that) might be inefficient.

I encountered this issue because I actually did create a ListBuffer, then invoke ++ on it, with the expectation that I'd get a new ListBuffer.  Of course I can work around it by sticking a toList in there, but that's the sort of thing that I had to do a lot with the 2.7 collections, and I understand that the 2.8 collections are supposed to have a better, more consistent API.
I agree with you completely - it would be more consistent to return an entirely new collection. However, I believe deprecation was introduced for reasons of not breaking existing client code relying on `++` returning the very same object instance. In any case, I think this will have to be discussed before taking any action.

As for the object statically typed as `Traversable` behaving as a `Traversable` although its dynamic type is a `ListBuffer`, I believe this could be considered a bug - the reason is that the method `++` in `Traversable` is overloaded to a curried method taking an additional parameter - a builder factory (`CanBuildFrom`) which is marked as an implicit. On the other hand, buffers overload this method to only take another traversable collection and not a builder factory. In short - methods `++` above are not the same methods in these 2 cases. 

What will probably happen at some point is that the `++` in `BufferLike` (and similar members) will be removed completely, which means that the correct method will be resolved at compile time - the one expecting an implicit builder factory. If you are asking when this will happen - my guess is in 2.9.

I'd like to reopen this issue for further consideration.

To me, it's a shame that this behavior is being retained despite all of the effort that has gone into developing the new collection classes with a well-defined and consistent API.  I understand that ++ updated the collection in the 2.7 collections, and that changing it in the 2.8 collections might break some 2.7 code that depends on the current behavior.  But I thought that one of the motivations for rebuilding the collections in 2.8 was to get rid of all the inconsistent and ad-hoc behavior in the 2.7 collections.

If Buffer is ever made to implement ++ according to the specification, then at that point, developers who depend on the old behavior will have to change their code.  The right time to do that is now, because the change is trivial (change "++" to "++=" or "{ x ++= y; x }" at the very worst), the word is already out that the collections have undergone major changes for 2.8, and developers will be scrutinizing their collection-using code when upgrading to 2.8.

Consider also that the goal of retaining the 2.7 behavior has already been compromised.  While in the trival case of using ++ to append to a ListBuffer works in 2.8, this code produces different results in 2.7 in 2.8:

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
val a = new ListBuffer[Int]
a ++ List(1, 2, 3)
val b = a ++ List("a", "b", "c")
b ++ List(4,5,6)
b
```

Basically in 2.7 the second-to-last line creates a new collection while in 2.8 it appends to b.

Upgrading any significant body of code that uses collections heavily from 2.7 to 2.8 is going to require effort, and I think that saving developers the incremental  effort of changing their use of ListBuffer.++ (assuming that anyone even depends on the 2.7 behavior) isn't worth leaving a wart in the API that is inconsistent with the brand new specification and will persist for years to come.
As illustration, I just implemented -Xmigration and attached warnings to the bits of Stack which changed from 2.7 to 2.8.  Now compiling with that option one would see things like:
```scala
[scalacfork] Compiling 542 files to /scratch/trunk1/build/quick/classes/library
[scalacfork] /scratch/trunk1/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashSet.scala:131: warning: method foreach in class Stack has changed semantics:

```
Etc.

So there's already functionality in the compiler to warn developers about code that compiles but may behave differently?  That sounds like a far better way to handle this issue!

I misspoke.  "elements" was replaced with "iterator" in 2.8 so in light of that, "keysIterator" and "valuesIterator" make sense, though they are unfortunately verbose.

iterator() = iterator over this collection (of key-value pairs in the case of Map)
keys() = a new collection consisting of the keys of this Map
values() = a new collection consisting of the values of this Map
keysIterator() = an iterator over "keys"
valuesIterator() = an iterator over "values"

But the problem is that "keys" and "values" **also** return iterators in 2.8, so the API as a whole doesn't make sense.

I created another issue #3145 for this.
(In r21167) Leveraged -Xmigration to burn off some warts which arose in the
new collections.  Warnings put in place for behavioral changes,
allowing the following.  1) Buffers: create new collections on
++ and -- like all the other collections.  2) Maps: eliminated
never-shipped redundant method valuesIterable and supplied these
return types:

  def keys: Iterable[A]
  def keysIterator: Iterator[A]
  def values: Iterable[B]
  def valuesIterator: Iterator[B]
  def keySet: Set[A]

I concluded that keys should return Iterable because keySet
also exists on Map, and is not solely in the province of Maps
even if we wanted to change it: it's defined on Sorted and
also appears in some Sets.  So it seems sensible to have keySet
return a Set and keys return the more general type.

Closes #3089, #3145.  Review by odersky.
(In r21219) More fun with -Xmigration.  Followed through on the changes
to BufferLike (++ and similar now create a new collection.)
Removed MapLikeBase.  Annotated all the methods in mutable.{ Map, Set }
which mutated in-place in 2.7 to note that they create new
collections, and implemented same.

At this point the only +/- like method which mutates in place
which I am aware of is BufferLike.+ (see source comment for my
observations.)

Also tweaked some collections return types as necessitated by these
changes, such as mutable.Set.clone() now returning "This" rather
than mutable.Set[A].
