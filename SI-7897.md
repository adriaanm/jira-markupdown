The name-based pattern matcher doesn't like a Product1 extractor.

The extracted value is taken as `v` instead of `v._1`.

Here is the test added to `test/files/run/name-based-patmat.scala`:
{code}
package p0 { 
  class Single(val x: Any) extends AnyRef with Product1[String] {
    private def s = "" + x
    override def canEqual(x: Any) = this eq x.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
    def isEmpty = false
    def get = this
    def _1 = s + " only"

    override def toString = s"Single(${_1})"
  }

  object Single {
    def unapply(x: Any): Single = new Single(x)
  }
}
{code}
This throws CCE:
{code}
    "catdog" match {
      case p0.Single(x) => println(s"`$x` has ${x.length} chars")
      case x            => println("fail: " + x)
    }
{code}

FWIW, I was working from this spec (i.e. commit comment):
"If it does not contain _1, then it is a single value
extractor analogous like Option[T]."

"Wip it good."  Is that an old one?

I have a spec question.  Boolean match is achieved by unapply returning boolean.  What about `get` returning boolean?  It's the same use case.  Right now, you must supply a pattern arg.  isEmpty means you don't match.

The additional use case is that in a macro, it's more symmetrical or regular to generate the return of get in one place. I already worked around SI-7897 in the obvious way, `get: String`, so this was the next target.
{code}
  class Nada(s: String) extends AnyRef {
    def isEmpty = s != "null"
    def get: Boolean = !isEmpty

    override def toString = "Nada"
  }

  object Nada {
    def unapply(x: Any): Nada = new Nada(String.valueOf(x))
  }
{code}
Trying to eliminate the bad:
{code}
    null match {
      case p0.Nada(/*bad*/) => println(s"matched Nada")
      case _         => println("no matchada")
    }
{code}
Possibly the same issue as SI-7850
