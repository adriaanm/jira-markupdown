Methods <ins>: and :</ins> in collection.immutable.Queue return a Seq. I think they should return a Queue. E.g.
```scala
var q = collection.immutable.Queue[ Int ]()
q = q enqueue 1 // ok but awkward
q += 2 // deprecated
q :+= 3  // error: trying to assign Seq to Queue
```

there are many other methods, e.g. padTo, diff, intersect, union that for some reason revert to Seq.
