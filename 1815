I already beefed up my pom to add the nature -- still got the compilation failure. But I did isolate the problem (nothing to do with the pom):

I cleared the .classpath of all dependencies, compiled (lots of errors but no compiler failure), added one back, repeat. 

Once I got to the scalatest dependency (which just happened to be the last) I reproduced the compiler error. But wait, there's more. If I remove the sourcepath= element then the compilation error is gone! WTF? The source jar referenced does exist, and eclipse can open the sources. Anyway what should that have to do with compilation?

So this causes the compiler error:

{code}
<classpathentry kind="var" path="M2_REPO/org/scala-tools/testing/scalatest/0.9.5/scalatest-0.9.5.jar" 
	sourcepath="M2_REPO/org/scala-tools/testing/scalatest/0.9.5/scalatest-0.9.5-sources.jar"/>
{code}

But this does not:

{code}
<classpathentry kind="var" path="M2_REPO/org/scala-tools/testing/scalatest/0.9.5/scalatest-0.9.5.jar"/>
{code}
