BTW, a workaround is to indirect through a lambda:
```scala
scala> () => Test.test(s => s + s)
res0: () => Unit = <function0>

scala> res0()
Splitting from [0 5)
Could not split [0 3)
Could not split [3 5)
Trying at 3 [3, 5)
Trying at 0 [0, 3)
Trying at 1 [0, 3)
Trying at 4 [3, 5)
Trying at 2 [0, 3)
Trying at 5 [3, 5)
Trying at 3 [0, 3)
