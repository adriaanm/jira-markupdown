In a Scala project, if we delete an existing file and then create a file with the same name and in the same directory the newly created file contain the contents of the previously deleted file.

*Steps to reproduce*
 1. Create a Scala project
 2. Create a class A in a new file (A.scala)
 3. Change the contents of A.scala and save it
 4. Delete A.scala
 5. Recreate class A

After step 5 the A.scala file will contain the modifications made in step 3.

Tested with r20608.
