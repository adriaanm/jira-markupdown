There is a bug in the implementation of MailBox.receiveWithin. If the call timesout then the next message that *could* have been sent to the block will be sent to that block (which is no longer valid) rather than either going into the pending queue or to a current waiting block. The bug appears to be caused by the timedout block not removing itself from the list of available receivers, this may also be a memory leak until an appropriate message is sent.

Gist of testcase and email to scala-users lists: http://gist.github.com/547596 (ill attach both to this ticket)
There was some talk on the #scala IRC channel that this is an actor subsystem only class, not suitable for public consumption, if so then the documentation should be updated to reflect that. One person in IRC said it didn't appear that the receieveWithin is used in the actor subsystem so it could be removed entirely.

This `Mailbox` class has been deprecated at least since Scala 2.9. It will be removed in Scala 2.10.
