Compiling this with scalac (tested 2.8.0.RC2):

{code}
abstract class BulkSearch {
       type R   <: Row
       type Rel <: Relation [R]
       type Corr <: Correspondence[R]

       def searchFor(input: Rel): Mapping[Corr] = null
}

object BulkSearchInstance extends BulkSearch {
       type R   = UpRow
       type Rel = UpRelation
       type Corr = UpCorrespondence
}

class Row
class UpRow extends Row

class Relation [R <: Row]
class UpRelation extends Relation [UpRow]

class Correspondence [R <: Row]
class UpCorrespondence extends Correspondence [UpRow]

class Mapping[MC <: Correspondence[_]]
{code}

and compiling this with javac:

{code}
public class JavaApp {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
               BulkSearchInstance.searchFor(new UpRelation());
       }
}
{code}

produces no compile-time errors but a runtime error later on:

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: bugs.BulkSearchInstance.searchFor(Lbugs/UpRelation;)Lbugs/Mapping;
       at bugs.JavaApp.main(JavaApp.java:15)
       at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
       at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)
       at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)
       at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:597)
       at com.intellij.rt.execution.application.AppMain.main(AppMain.java:110)
{code}

After some analysis, I found out that is probably due to an inconsistent generic signature being generated for the static method delegate in `BulkSearchInstance.class`.

Scalac generates these signatures for `BulkSearchInstance.searchFor`:

{code}
method_info.descriptor (see ï¿½ 4.3 JVM spec): (LRelation;)LMapping;
attribute 'Signature' (see JSR 014): (LUpRelation;)LMapping<LUpCorrespondence;>;
{code}

When javac sees that, it produces something strange (i.e. not matching the descriptor found in `BulkSearchInstance.class`):

{code}
invokestatic    SI-4; //Method BulkSearchInstance.searchFor:(LUpRelation;)LMapping;
{code}

which looks like the erasure of the generic signature.  However, JVM's linker looks for the exact descriptor when looking for methods. I think the solution should be
  1. Always generate consistent descriptor and generic signature
  2. At least, in the case of the static delegator method in the object class, generate the most specific type possible. The method can't be overridden anyways.

Workaround: use a trait instead of an abstract class
(In r22043) Closes SI-3452, inconsistency between method descriptors and java signature for static forwarders. Review by extempore.
I've further simplified the example to

{code}
trait Search[M] {
    def search(input: M): C[Int] = null
}

object StringSearch extends Search[String]

trait C[T]
{code}

and 

{code}
public class JavaApp {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
               StringSearch.search("test");
       }
}
{code}

In a strange way the error depends on the return value being an applied type (strange because the error appears in the parameter position). The problem is actually catched using the {{-Ycheck:genjvm}} flag:

{code}

Yes, you need the {{-Ycheck:genjvm}} to generate the warning. Looking at the code there's a {{return}} after generating the warning which circumvents the generation of the broken signature. This would explain why using the flag makes the runtime error disappear.

It may be sensible to enable this flag/code path by default if this can't be fixed soon or is still likely to be broken in some cases. That would mean that a) you _can_ use these methods at all from Java even if the compiler still has a bug when generating them b) you are loosing generic type info at the Java side because the generic type is missing. Compare that to the current situation where although Java can compile against the generic type, the call fails at runtime.
I spent most of the last two days on this bug.  It's a multiway battle of a bunch of tests where one passing leads to another failing.  Still unresolved.

BTW I don't see the warning regardless of -Ycheck, I don't know why.  I know it's generating the bad signatures.

Oh, wonderful.  I wasn't seeing the warning because the check looking for the string "genjvm" which is not actually the name of the phase.  I, having catlike reflexes with respect to the phase names, was entering it as "-Ycheck:jvm" which is what it is supposed to be.  You guys were smart enough to enter the string it was looking for.

** NOTICE! I'M FIXING IT! **

That means it's -Ycheck:jvm, and -Ycheck:genjvm refers to a non-existent phase.  The options which take a phase argument should probably fail on mystery strings, but right now they silently ignore.  Still, you know if it checked by examining the output: it will always say "[Now checking: jvm]" if it understood you, and it will be silent if it did not.


The reason I only warn rather than fixing it at the signature generation point is that detecting it depends on sun internal classes and I don't want to add one more mystery by having it work some places and not others.  It would not be rocket science to write our own signature parser, but it's not something I have time for at the moment (even though I've already done it, more than once in fact...) if anyone wants to bring up to date some of the parsers in here, it'd be so appreciated.

Look how beautiful:

  https://github.com/paulp/awesome/blob/master/src/main/scala/awesome/jvm/SignatureParser.scala

This one is especially compelling given that that's all the necessary logic:

  https://github.com/paulp/awesome/blob/master/src/main/scala/awesome/jvm/DescriptorParser.scala

I just submitted pull request https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/584. I'm running the test suite now, and I'll run 'ant dist' later to be totally sure I didn't break anything (since _ant_ is managing incremental compilation, that looks required).
Jenkins claims that my pull request passes all tests:
https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/pr-scala-testsuite-linux-opt/130

However, the number of times the warning triggers (for instance when compiling the standard library) is scary:
https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/pr-scala-testsuite-linux-opt/130/console
After all, the pattern eliciting the problem does not seem to be unusual, and scalac would probably ignore the erased signature and only consider the generic one, hence this amount of warning is not necessarily wrong (also, I did not modify the warning itself, I only enabled it by default).

Moreover, it is somewhat interesting that tests pass, since on my local machine I get errors (_mostly_ OOM) while running the test suite, both with and without my changes (I'm comparing the results).

Your errors are probably just ant not having enough memory.

It's easy for the tests to pass and all the warnings to be valid, because scalac ignores the generic signatures completely.  To see the breakage caused by this bug, you generally have to involve java so that something will be miscompiled based on the inaccurate signature.

Signature verification wasn't on by default for performance reasons, so you will probably want to measure the asm impact.

The underlying issue is fairly hairy (and there is more than one.) I have it fairly well outlined and fixed for some approximation of fixed, but I have recently lost my taste for this brand of completely thankless work.  If you want I can clean up that branch and hand it over if you'd like to go for the finish line.

Here it is: https://github.com/paulp/scala/commit/11c11f0efc

Another reason I stopped there is that I thought my time would be better spent rewriting the backend not to generate wrong signatures, rather than spending any more of my life chasing bugs which could be made impossible with decent engineering.  But that's another thing I've lost enthusiasm for.

> I'm taking a look at this. After reading the commit message, I'm not totally sure what's missing there, so I'll have to give a closer look - I'd greatly appreciate any specific hints.

Take a look at the diff from the two failing tests (assuming it still acts the way I've described; since I've rebased it I can't guarantee it.) It will point you in the direction of the problem.  The change in mixin overshoots the target.

Aah I see, I had completely misunderstood the message. I tested the commit on top of my pull request, so the tests don't fail but there are still warnings, like the following confusing one for instance.

[scalacfork] abstract class Erasure extends AddInterfaces
{code}

The problem is in the return type, {{Namers.this.Namers$TypeCompleter with Namers.this.Namers$LockingTypeCompleter}}, which makes little sense since {{LockingTypeCompleter <: TypeCompleter}} (I complained somewhere else that intersection types are not always properly simplified- XXX-I'll have to find where!). In addition to making little sense, this intersection type is transformed in different ways - erased to the most specific type of the two (LockingTypeCompleter), which looks good; instead the generic signature contains simply the first component of the intersection; i.e., {{A with B}} becomes {{A}} in the generic signature even if {{B <: A}}).
About intersection types not being simplified, I'll quote src/compiler/scala/reflect/internal/Types.scala:
{code}
/**** This implementation to merge parents was checked in in commented-out
      form and has languished unaltered for five years.  I think we should
      use it or lose it.
{code}
Moreover, as far as I see (mostly) from comments, there's no attempt to simplify the intersection of a class with its parents in method {{Types.intersectionType}}.
Anyway. I shall continue investigations later.
>  In addition to making little sense, this intersection type is transformed in different ways - erased to the most specific type of the two (LockingTypeCompleter), which looks good; instead the generic signature contains simply the first component of the intersection; i.e., A with B becomes A in the generic signature even if B <: A).

No, I don't think this quite captures the problem.  Given this situation:

abstract class A 
trait B extends A

In scala B <: A, but that relationship is only known to scala and can't be expressed in the method descriptor.  If the descriptor says "B", scala is attempting to say "some unknown class which extends A and implements B" but all java is going to hear is "B", which does not include A.  So it is not clear that B is the most specific type, at least not usefully so.
{code}
abstract class Foo

trait Bar1
trait Bar2 extends Foo
trait Bar3 { self: Foo => }

class Test {
  def f1 = new Foo { }
  def f2 = new Foo with Bar1 { }
  def f3 = new Foo with Bar2 { }
  def f4 = new Foo with Bar3 { }

  // descriptors:
  // public Foo f1();
  // public Foo f2();
  // public Bar2 f3();
  // public Foo f4();
}
{code}

Paul, this semantic issue is most interesting. I also find interesting that you didn't point me to a specification about these issues, and I see why you complained before.

I'm not sure I get you fully, but I do see that things are not so simple as I thought. But does your example support your point? In our case, the relevant descriptor is the one for {{f3}}, which is declared to return {{Bar2}}, which corresponds to {{B}} in your discussion. That is, the erasure algorithm works as _I_ would have expected. Generic signatures are instead computed in a different way: there {{Foo with Bar2}} erases to {{Foo}}, and even {{Bar2}} erases to {{Foo}}, as shown in the testcase below!

However, the erasure algorithm does what I considered obvious, and I would keep that unchanged for binary compatibility, since there might be existing Java code calling into Scala using erased descriptors (I wrote some myself, even if it was an horrible experience since the Scala interface was much more fancy).
Instead, the generic signatures we produce currently cannot be used if they don't match the descriptors, so we can change them to match more the descriptors without breaking binary compatibility so much - especially before the release of 2.10.

Do you agree about changing that algorithm?

h1. Example
The above example has no generic signatures, but adding type parameters produces a reduced version of the problem in {{Erasure}}:

{code}
//Other definitions like above, I only changed Test.
class Test {
  def f1 = new Foo { }
  def f2 = new Foo with Bar1 { }
  def f3 = new Foo with Bar2 { }
  def f4 = new Foo with Bar3 { }
  def f5 = new Bar2 { }
  def f6[T](t: T) = new Foo with Bar2 { }
  def f7[T](t: T) = new Bar2 { }

  // descriptors:
  // public Foo f1();
  // public Foo f2();
  // public Bar2 f3();
  // public Foo f4();
  // public Bar2 f5();
  // public Bar2 f6(Object);
  // public Bar2 f7(Object);
  // Both f6 and f7 have generic signature:
  // <T:Ljava/lang/Object;>(TT;)LFoo;
  // which means <T extends Object> Foo methodName(T);
}
{code}
Of course, the generic signature is only emitted by a mainline Scala compiler, with the warning disabled. The generic signature warning (that is, {{-Ycheck:jvm}} or my pull request) reports the following warnings and omits generic signatures:
{code}
SI-3452/DescriptorExample.scala:13: warning: compiler bug: created generic signature for method f6 in Test that does not conform to its erasure
signature: <T:Ljava/lang/Object;>(TT;)LFoo;

if this is reproducible, please report bug at https://issues.scala-lang.org/
  def f6[T](t: T) = new Foo with Bar2 { }
      ^
SI-3452/DescriptorExample.scala:14: warning: compiler bug: created generic signature for method f7 in Test that does not conform to its erasure

if this is reproducible, please report bug at https://issues.scala-lang.org/
  def f7[T](t: T) = new Bar2 { }
      ^
two warnings found
{code}

Notice, in particular, that the algorithm producing generic signatures transforms not only {{Foo with Bar2}} into {{Foo}}, but also {{Bar2}} into {{Foo}} (see {{f7}}). This shows nicely another source of mismatch between generic signatures and erased types.

Back to encoding {{Bar2 with Foo}}, Java does have some kind of intersection types, at least in type bounds, which _might_ be useful; I did not look into it because I'm sure somebody smarter already tried and failed. For instance, given Java method {{<T extends Foo & Bar2> T foo()}}, probably type inference would not infer a type argument for {{T}}.

h1. Other remaining bugs
I categorized warnings on the library (which are simpler). Here's a list of what is left there:

# tons of Nothing-vs-Nothing$ mismatches:
{code}
[scalacfork] signature: (TB;)Lscala/runtime/Nothing$;
[scalacfork] original type: (x$1: Object)Nothing
[scalacfork] normalized type: (x$1: Object)scala.runtime.Nothing$
[scalacfork] erasure type: (x$1: Object)Nothing
{code}
The documentation of Nothing$ claims that Nothing should erase to Nothing$; this one sounds easiest to fix, so I'll take a look at it first - I might actually be able to fix this.
# parsers seems to show the same problem with intersection types again;

{code}
"..." is what it (rather opaquely) prints when it hits the maximum recursion depth trying to print the type.

This is exceeding the complexity of conversation I want to have in the useless jira comment interface.  Could I talk you into starting a thread on scala-language? Also that way we might get some assistance.

Paul, commenting just now on a ticket two thousand notches younger than this one (SI-1459):
{quote}
Interesting, I didn't realize it at the time but it sounds from my description above that this is intimately related to SI-3452.
{quote}
And going two thousand and more notches in the other direction, see also SI-6050.
See also SI-6414 .
Closing as the problems with trait forwarders and static forwarders has been fixed in 2.11.0, by emitting weaker signatures if the exact one won't be coherent with the erasure.

I'm hopeful we'll find a more refined approach in the future. I've outlined the ideas for that: SI-8293

If I have missed any residual signature issues that weren't related to forwarders, please open a new ticket and link it to this one.
