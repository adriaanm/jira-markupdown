It serves no purpose. It is slower than using a String for map lookups because its construction itself requires a map lookup, by String no less. And it's constructed at every use even when using the special notation, unlike regular Strings.
The only way it's useful is if instances are defined as constants, which makes the special syntax pretty much useless, and actually counterproductive, since it hides the massive overhead behind it, and instead pretends it's like a String constant.

What's the reason to care about reference equality? Faster comparison, some subset of those comparisons are done in maps.

Regardless, the request is now for either deprecation of the special Symbol syntax, as it is misleading, or making it a compile time constant. Otherwise it serves no benefit and has the potential to make code perform slower in places where users are in fact trying to attempt the opposite.
