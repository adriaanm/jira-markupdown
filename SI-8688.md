patch doesn't work properly on views when it turns into an append and there isn't actually anything to append:

{code}
scala> Seq(0,1).view.patch(1,Seq(),1).foreach(println)
0
java.util.NoSuchElementException: next on empty iterator
...

scala> Stream(0,1).view.patch(1,Stream(),1).foreach(println)
0
java.util.NoSuchElementException: next on empty iterator
 ...
{code}


Will be fixed by https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3801 that makes patch more consistent (see also https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8474)
