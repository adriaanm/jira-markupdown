The interpreter rejects multiline comments inside of objects.


```scala
scala> object Fine {
     | /** no crash here **/
     | // or here
     | }
defined module Fine


scala> object Crash {
     | /** this will crash
<console>:2: error: '}' expected but eof found.
       /** this will crash
                          ^

scala> /** this however
     |  * seems to be fine
     |  */

```

I get this on 2.7.0-final and 2.7.1.RC1. I'm running MacOSX.

I think Julien reports that all multiline comments (not just inside objects) crash on his Linux distro.
