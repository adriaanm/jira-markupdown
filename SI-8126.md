As described in an email by Jason:
```
I've been plugging a few soundness holes recently, and thought it might be good to make some of the fixes opt-out with a compiler flag.

For example: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3178#issuecomment-29444519

We've discussed having a \-source: option in the context of using the 2.11 presentation for 2.10 projects. I could put these sort of things behind that flag rather than inventing a plethora of new \-Ybug\-compat\-SI\-1234 flags.
```

The current (among others, IDE team) goal is to not only implement that flag but use it to constrain all 2.11 fixes that prevent the type checker from running on a 2.10 code base.
PR [3340](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3340) Merge commit [b296396](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b2963960820734e27d334738cfff5b5354536ec5)
I'd like to consolidate this with -Xfuture, which corresponds to running 2.11 under -Xsource:2.12. 

See #8361.
