Currently, `scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner` insists on calling exit; there is no way to avoid this, e.g., when one wants to call `MainGenericRunner.main` from within a test or benchmark harness.

In contrast, `scala.tools.nsc.Main`, solves this problem quite neatly by separating the main functionality from the call to exit:
```scala
def main(args: Array[String]) {
  process(args)
  exit(if (reporter.hasErrors) 1 else 0)
}
```

It would be great if `scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner` could follow the lead of `scala.tools.nsc.Main`.
