Hi everyone,
I found a minor bug inside the documentation: the shown type signatures for use cases are some times wrong. An example can be found here:

[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Map]

The method copyToArray has use case signature:
```scala
def copyToArray(xs: Array[A], start: Int, len: Int): Unit
```

The 'A' above means the type parameter of GenTraversableOnce, but in maps 'A' is the type of the keys. So some could think the method copies only the keys into the array.

The correct signature should be:
```scala
def copyToArray(xs: Array[(A, B)], start: Int, len: Int): Unit
```

The pattern could be found in the trait BitSet or the method sum.

Btw: Full signatures are always correct.

So... How to solve this issue?

Here my three cents:

- Dumb attempt: Writing additional use case where ever the type signature of inherited methods change.
- Structural but still dumb attempt: Using the scaladoc macros. Define an 'A' macro at the top level with @define A A and overwrite by @define A (A, B) in Maps. (Maybe this isn't possible, I don't tested it)
- Compiler-Fu: All use case signatures should be valid scala. So it should be possible to interfere the correct signature by the compile; as it already does for the full signature.

Due the lack of Compiler-Fu I would chose the structural dumb way or going into a Dojo ;-)

Kind regards, Daniel
This problem has been reported in

I agree it is highly confusing.
