The same issue with immutable.RedBlack. Just create following file in Eclipse:
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack;

public class Test {}
{code}

and you'll get following error message:
Multiple markers at this line
	- The class file RedBlack<A> contains a signature '()Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Empty;' ill-formed at 
	 position 44
	- The class file RedBlack<A> contains a signature '()Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Empty;' ill-formed at 
	 position 44

I believe there is other kind of broken signature (probably unrelated to this ticket) but it's hard to check it until this issue is fixed.
