Here's the bug, and this is what I meant about not inspecting typeSymbol directly:
```scala
        if (tpe.typeSymbol == ArrayClass) {
          val componentTpe = tpe.typeArguments(0)
```
typeSymbol normalizes, but typeArguments doesn't.  So it seems to be an Array, but then you take the type  arguments from the type alias, and there aren't any.
