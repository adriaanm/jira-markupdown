I created an enhancement where:
- Linear super types and known subclasses are separately expandable sections
- Both sections have arrow images like expandable members have
- Known subclasses are sorted by name

The diff is attached.
(In r24710) [scaladoc] Separate sections for "linear supertype" and "known subclasses" using patch provided by Ruediger Keller. Closes SI-4456. Closes SI-4304.
