Type lambdas are cool and all, but not a single line of the compiler was ever written with them in mind. They're just not going to work right: the relevant code is not robust. I spent a day or so looking at scala/bug#5294 not long ago and it was too hard to fix; this is probably a duplicate. I doubt there are more than three people right now with any chance of fixing this stuff and all of us have a bunch of higher priorities, so if this is important to you I suggest rolling up your sleeves (this would be in the "way, way up" position) and seeing what you can do.
