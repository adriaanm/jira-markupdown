I think it's fixed:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r0-b20091113160310 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> List(1).isInstanceOf[List[String]]      
warning: there were unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
res0: Boolean = true
```

please reopen if I'm missing something
