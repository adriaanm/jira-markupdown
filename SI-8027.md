The behavior how it should be:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.1 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> List(1)
res0: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> res0.map // hit tab button the first time
map           mapConserve   

scala> res0.map // hit tab button the second time
                                                                                    
def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: generic.CanBuildFrom[Repr,B,That]): That   

scala> res0.map
```

How it is:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20131103-143755-4a6882e772 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> List(1)
res0: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> res0.map // hit tab button the first time
map           mapConserve   

scala> res0.map // hit tab button the second time
map           mapConserve   

scala> res0.map
```

The REPL doesn't recognize anymore that the tab button is pressed two times.
Was not an interesting jline issue.
