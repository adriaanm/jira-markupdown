Exactly the OP:
```scala
package isfun

object Test extends App {
  val st = scala.reflect.runtime.universe.asInstanceOf[scala.reflect.internal.SymbolTable]

  Console println st.definitions.isFunctionType(st.typeOf[Function0[_]])
}
```
I wasn't trying to be clever.  It's still too bad one has to type the word "code" in braces.  It should auto-detect code.
