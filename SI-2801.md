In 2.7 <: AnyRef is not enough to assign null, you have to say >: Null.  And you get the following reasonably sensible behavior.
{code}
scala> def f[A <: AnyRef] = { val a: A = null ; a }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Null(null)
 required: A

scala> def f[A >: Null] = { val a: A = null ; a }
f: [A >: Null]A

scala> f
res0: Null = null

scala> f[Nothing]
<console>:6: error: type arguments [Nothing] do not conform to method f's type parameter bounds [A >: Null]
       f[Nothing]
{code}
Somewhere along the way in 2.8 saying <: AnyRef was enough.  This leads to this somewhat strange behavior, presumably because it's inferring Nothing.
{code}
scala> def f[A <: AnyRef] = { val a: A = null ; a }
f: [A <: AnyRef]A

scala> f[AnyRef]
res0: AnyRef = null

scala> f[Null]
res1: Null = null

scala> f
java.lang.NullPointerException
{code}
This might be nothing but a curiosity, but I'm opening the ticket because I'd really like to know what's supposed to happen in these bottom type situations.
(In r20233) Closed SI-2801. Had to update a couple of files that already exploited the missing test.
