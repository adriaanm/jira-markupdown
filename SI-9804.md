Using the current HEAD of 2.12.x (af93c7a147156f69cad78cc80a36aeaeb89cbe0c) after the first expression, the REPL is broken - you can't see what you type:

{code}
Welcome to Scala 2.11.9-20160520-170134-99dad60 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_74).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> 1
res0: Int = 1

scala> res1: Int = 2

scala> res2: Int = 3

scala> res3: Int = 3
{code}

I've bisected it to https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/99dad60d984d3f72338f3bad4c4fe905090edd51, which is part of https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4998

Note that that pull request was made against 2.11.x, so it's also broken there (there's no {{2.11.x}} in "Affects Version/s"..)

/cc [~apm]
Also, on ctl-D
{code}
scala> <console>:1: error: illegal character '\u0004'
\u0004
^
{code}

Also, this isn't broken in the custom {{scala}} task (in scala/scala's sbt build), nor is it in {{build/quick/bin/scala}}, it's something in that change that clashes with how sbt setups or invokes the REPL.

against 2.11, which must be merged forward for 2.12.

Somebody ought to update SBT not to use API deprecated since 2.9.0. That would make it easier to control these extension points.

In older code, the reader set by SBT was immediately overwritten; in the newer code, the reader was initialized before the call to createInterpreter, which SBT overrides (and in which SBT sets its own reader).
