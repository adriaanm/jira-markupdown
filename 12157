I was using the "events" tab of YourKit, which does show File open/read/write/close events, with stack traces at each of them. But I didn't spot events for the JAR I was testing against at all.

You can always put your own version of {{FileZipFileArchive.class}} ahead of {{scala-reflect.jar}} in the JVM classpath of Ensime if you want to "monkeypatch" in a new version.
