{code}
val buffer = new collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]
{
  // chagne from public to protected
  override def ensureSize(n : Int) = super.ensureSize(n)

  def foo = println("new method")
}

buffer.foo // ok
buffer.ensureSize(100) // error
{code}

error: method ensureSize cannot be accessed in scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]{def foo: Unit}
See also SI-1994.
Isn't an anonymous class same as a singleton?
{code}
object buffer extends collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int]
{
  // chagne from public to protected
  override def ensureSize(n : Int) = super.ensureSize(n)

  def foo = println("new method")
}
{code}
These are just bugs. There's no reason for "override def foo()" not to widen the access to public just because it's an anonymous class. If you wanted it to remain protected, you would have written "override protected def foo()".
{code}

scala> abstract class FooClass { protected def bar: Int }
defined class FooClass

scala> val x = new FooClass { def bar = 1 }
x: FooClass = $anon$1@7da72267

scala> x.bar
<console>:10: error: method bar in class FooClass cannot be accessed in FooClass
 Access to protected method bar not permitted because
 enclosing object $iw is not a subclass of 
 class FooClass where target is defined
              x.bar
                ^

scala> val x = new FooClass { val bar = 1 }
x: FooClass{val bar: Int} = $anon$1@393ddf54

scala> x.bar
res0: Int = 1
{code}

But...

{code}
scala> abstract class FooClass { protected val bar: Int }
defined class FooClass

scala> val x = new FooClass { val bar = 1 }
x: FooClass = $anon$1@72f9a516

scala> x.bar
<console>:10: error: value bar in class FooClass cannot be accessed in FooClass
 Access to protected value bar not permitted because
 enclosing object $iw is not a subclass of 
 class FooClass where target is defined
              x.bar
                ^
{code}

scala insists I bring SOMETHING new to the table if I want to widen the access: def becomes val, more specific return type... but with no "public" keyword, it is impossible to just say it. But there's no reason we should make you say it anyway, because the absence of access modifiers means public! Why would it infer a more restrictive type than the one we declared?

Here's the kind of desperation one ends up with.
{code}
scala> abstract class FooClass { protected val bar: Int }
defined class FooClass

scala> val x = new FooClass { override val bar = 1.asInstanceOf[Int with Nothing] }
x: FooClass{val bar: Int with Nothing} = $anon$1@6e963c02

scala> x.bar
res0: Int with Nothing = 1

scala> x.bar: Int
res1: Int = 1
{code}

You don't really want to know:

          // This is very tricky stuff, because we are navigating the Skylla and Charybdis of
          // anonymous classes and what to return from them here. On the one hand, we cannot admit
          // every non-private member of an anonymous class as a part of the structural type of the
          // enclosing block. This runs afoul of the restriction that a structural type may not
          // refer to an enclosing type parameter or abstract types (which in turn is necessitated
          // by what can be done in Java reflection). On the other hand, making every term member
          // private conflicts with private escape checking - see ticket #3174 for an example.
          //
          // The cleanest way forward is if we would find a way to suppress structural type checking
          // for these members and maybe defer type errors to the places where members are called.
          // But that would be a big refactoring and also a big departure from existing code. The
          // probably safest fix for 2.8 is to keep members of an anonymous class that are not
          // mentioned in a parent type private (as before) but to disable escape checking for code
          // that's in the same anonymous class. That's what's done here.
