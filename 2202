One problem with the patch:
This line does not do what is says it does:
{code}
  // initialise all TypeVar's in pt with a clone of their initial TypeConstraint (saved when SearchImplicit was instatiated)
  typeVarsConstr = cloneConstrs(typeVarsConstr)
{code}
It should have been:
{code}
  typeVarsConstr = cloneConstrs(typeVarsOrigConstr)
{code}
