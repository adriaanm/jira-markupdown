after some thought and i-don't-tell-how-many-hours of working [on the prototype|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4668] for [my initial idea|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9375?focusedCommentId=72717&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-72717], i'm quite convinced now that the right solution is simply to NOT emit a readResolve method. Submitted in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4671.
