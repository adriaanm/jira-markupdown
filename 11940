Yes, I can workaround this particular bug in any number of ways. The real problem is that I can't trust the optimizer in 2.11. The above example is just one particular bug that I was able to isolate. I have more, I just haven't been able to isolate them yet. I have a value class many of whose methods are marked `@inline` that I use extensively, and many of the unit tests that use this class (directly or indirectly) are failing. These tests all pass if I leave off `-optimise`.

This is a show-stopper for me. I can't upgrade my project to Scala 2.11 because of it.
