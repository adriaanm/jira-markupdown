The example below 

{code}
val str = """              Dickey's Barbecue             
              (925) 426-6800              
Host: Elder                     06/13/2012
VALLEY CREST                       9:26 AM
                                     20002
                                          """
val expr = """(?s).*\({0,1}(\d{3})\){0,1}[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{3})[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{4}).*(?:Host:|Server:)\s+(?:((?:\w+\s{0,1})+)).*\s+(\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4}).*\s+(\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s[AP]M).*\s+\d+/(\d{5})""".r

expr.findFirstMatchIn(str)
{code}

hangs and takes up all CPU.. Seems like it's going into a infinite loop. If I take off the last pattern - """\d+/(\d{5})""" it finds match.
P.S. The same expression in java using java.util.regex.* works and returns false.
Here's the same using `p matcher str find` (which is what `findFirst` calls) and it has the same result, or lack thereof:

{code}
scala> import java.util.regex._
import java.util.regex._

scala> Pattern compile expr
res0: java.util.regex.Pattern = (?s).*\({0,1}(\d{3})\){0,1}[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{3})[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{4}).*(?:Host:|Server:)\s+(?:((?:\w+\s{0,1})+)).*\s+(\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4}).*\s+(\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s[AP]M).*\s+\d+/(\d{5})

scala> res0 matcher str
res1: java.util.regex.Matcher = java.util.regex.Matcher[pattern=(?s).*\({0,1}(\d{3})\){0,1}[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{3})[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{4}).*(?:Host:|Server:)\s+(?:((?:\w+\s{0,1})+)).*\s+(\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4}).*\s+(\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s[AP]M).*\s+\d+/(\d{5}) region=0,259 lastmatch=]

scala> .find
apm@mara:~/tmp$ 
{code}

That is one gnarly pattern.

Maybe the `matches` method gives up early and says, Nothing could possibly match that.


The RE is more successful if you replace the eager dot-stars with something more discriminating, such as 

{code}
"[^(]*\("  // etc
{code}

to wit,

{code}
scala> val expr = """[^(]*\(?(\d{3})\)?[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{3})[ \.-]{0,1}(\d{4})[^\w]*(?:Host:|Server:)\s+(?:((?:\w+\s{0,1})+))[^\d]*\s+(\d{1,2}/\d{1,2}/\d{2,4})[^\d]+(\d{1,2}:\d{2}\s[AP]M)\s+\d+/(\d{5})"""   // no idea if this is as intended

[snip]
scala> .find
res2: Boolean = false

scala> re findFirstMatchIn str
res3: Option[scala.util.matching.Regex.Match] = None
{code}

Please look at my first reply.

The methods that say "find" in Scala use "find" on the underlying Matcher in Java.

To invoke "matches", use a pattern match:

{code}
  val res = str match {
    case re(_*) => "OK!"
    case _      => "No way!"
  }
  Console println res
{code}

Yep. You are right. Seems like a bug in Java library itself. If I use matches it works but using find hangs. Guess I will have to find a workaround for now.
