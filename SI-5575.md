http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html says:

The returned collection is made up of all elements x which satisfy the invariant:
{code}
from <= indexOf(x) < until
{code}

That's not true - List("a", "b", "a").slice(0, 2) returns List("a", "b"), although the third element also satisfies the formula.

Besides, it should be "inequality", not "invariant", shouldn't it?
Please note that in your example above, the third element has index 2, and therefore it does not satisfy the invariant since {{indexOf( x)}} (which would == 2) is not < 2.

In general, it's often a good idea to have a look at the nightly docs, as in recent months the API documentation has been made more extensive and clearer (on stable classes/traits/objects like {{List}})

In this case, the API comment on the {{slice}} method of {{List}} has been improved (visible in the nightly build), and I bet you'd find it clearer: 
[http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.List]

It seemed that by indexOf( x) you meant a call to list.indexOf( x), which for the last element in List("a","b","a") also returns 0, because that's what list.indexOf("a") does. :-)

Anyway, I should have looked at the nightlies. Much better. Still not 100% correct, IMHO:

{code}
returns    a list containing the elements greater than or equal to index from extending up to (but not including) index until of this list.
{code}

It's not the *elements* that are "greater than or equal" but the *indexes*. How about this:

{code}
returns    a list containing the elements of this list with indexes greater than or equal to from and extending up to (but not including) until.
{code}

Well, given that it isn't an actual complete code example, I think the meaning of {{indexOf}} is conceptual (meant for a quick glance, and not for much scrutiny). Regardless, the line you take issue with has long been removed, so it should be of no issue anymore.

Until 2.10 is out, the nightlies are a better go-to for updated/expanded docs. My advice is to reach for them until 2.10 lands.

Sure, your correction sounds reasonable. Feel free to submit a pull-request (guidelines are here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vBHur7dd4UlTiL7dUd8RjzjQNKrz-KU38i2QYpyzL7w/edit]), and make sure to make the following spelling correction: indexes => indices
