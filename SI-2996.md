this is good:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
scala> new collection.mutable.GenericArray[Int](1).head
res16: Int = 0
```

but this is not so good:
```scala
scala> new collection.mutable.GenericArray[Int](1).toString
res17: String = GenericArray(null)
```

The "null" seems like an implementation detail that shouldn't leak out like this.

(Whether the Array[AnyRef] used internally by GenericArray ought to be initialized to contain a bunch of boxed integers instead of a bunch of nulls, or whether it ought to be toString's job to hide the difference, I don't know.)
See also #602.
What about to not display null elements of the collection ?

Here are more issues.
```scala
scala> new collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Float](5) mkString
res0: String = nullnullnullnullnull

scala> new collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Float](5) map (_.toString) mkString
res1: String = 0.00.00.00.00.0
```
Looks impossible, doesn't it.  For the map the compiler creates a Float => String and then dutifully unboxes the nulls.  (Thus my "see also #602.")
```scala
scala> scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToFloat(null)
res2: Float = 0.0
```
What do we lose if the size of the collection is divorced from the length of the array such that primitive array elements don't exist until they're initialized? An ArraySeq[Float] is then defined as a sequence of non-null Floats and new ArraySeq[Float](10) has size 0, with some other field like "capacity" reflecting the size of the underlying array.  Seems to pretty much work for StringBuilder.
```scala
scala> new StringBuilder("")
res3: StringBuilder = StringBuilder()

scala> res3.capacity
res4: Int = 16

scala> res3.size 
res5: Int = 0
```
Correction of typo :

Introduction of 'capacity' seems not to be a problem.

My main concern is about the way 'size' will behave.

What does size return if client don't store elements continuously in the array ?
Do we ignore the 'holes' ?
Do we stop counting once first null appears ?
If we ignore null elements, that would mean (IMO) that storing null in a Array is not meaningful. So we are adding a little be semantic to Array collection. Is that what we want ?

I now have a concrete patch.  Drum roll please!
```scala
-class ArraySeq[A](override val length: Int)
+class ArraySeq[@specialized A](override val length: Int)
```
Ta da.
```scala
scala> new collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int](5)
res0: scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int] = ArraySeq(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

scala> new collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Float](5) mkString
res1: String = 0.00.00.00.00.0
```
By the way, I would like to draw your attention on #2460.
If the patch properly address the issue, it would be nice to introduce it in 2.9

I can't even tell you how little I appreciate your lobbying in an unrelated ticket.  Please apply common sense.  I'm not difficult to contact via appropriate channels.
(In r24388) Specialized ArraySeq.  Closes #2996, no review.
The name "GenericArray" is gone, but none of the bugs are.
```scala
new scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int](1).toString
res0: String = ArraySeq(null)
```
@paulp So it is.  Thanks for catching that.  I should have checked that it was a deletion rather than a name change.
There isn't any way to rescue it with a `ClassTag`, I agree.

The only idea I have is to embrace the notion that `ArraySeq` can tell which elements have been initialized, and that it will traverse only those.  You can do this by filling the array with a sentinel element that can't otherwise be accessed.  foreaching over a bunch of `null` elements isn't so spiffy for regular classes either.

If we do this, then all becomes (somewhat) sane again.  Otherwise, I recommend we just deprecate it.  It's not *that* useful compared to `ArrayBuffer`.
