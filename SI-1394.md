The following code can't be launched by 2.7.RC2
"
package misc

class RecDescent {
}

object RecDescent {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {println("out")} 
}
"

however, removing the class allows it to launch:
"
package misc

object RecDescent {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {println("out")} 
}
"

Console reads "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main"
Popup window reads "Fatal exception occured.  Program will exit."
