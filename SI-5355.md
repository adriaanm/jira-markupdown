There have been a [few|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3466100/are-recursive-structural-types-not-supported-in-scala-anymore] [StackOverflow|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3201577/scala-how-to-define-a-structural-type-that-refers-to-itself] [questions|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8366518/is-it-possible-to-implement-liftm2-in-scala] related to recursive structural types, the answer to which is generally "Scala doesn't do that; use typeclasses instead."

Simple example:
{code}
type Num = {
  def +(n: Num): Num
}
{code}

I found SI-3165, but it wasn't clear to me whether this duplicates that issue...
This is a duplicate of SI-967, surely.

As an aside, it's possible to encode your way around the problem if you're really desperate,

{code}
// Gilles' fix for SI-967 causes the definition of Nat to be rejected with
// the error "Parameter type in structural refinement may not refer to a type
// member of that refinement". However we can work around the problem by 
// quantifying out the problematic parameter type and reinstating it via
// a generalized type constraint.

type Num = {
  type Rep
  val zero : Rep
  def succ[R](r : R)(implicit ev : R =:= Rep) : Rep
  def show[R](r : R)(implicit ev : R =:= Rep) : String
}

val IntNum : Num = new {
  type Rep = Int
  val zero = 0
  def succ[R](r : R)(implicit ev : R =:= Rep) : Rep = r+1
  def show[R](r : R)(implicit ev : R =:= Rep) = r.toString
}

val DoubleNum : Num = new {
  type Rep = Double
  val zero = 0.0
  def succ[R](r : R)(implicit ev : R =:= Rep) : Rep = r+1.0
  def show[R](r : R)(implicit ev : R =:= Rep) = r.toString
}

def two(n : Num) = n.show(n.succ(n.succ(n.zero)))

scala> two(IntNum)
res0: String = 2

scala> two(DoubleNum)
res1: String = 2.0
{code}
