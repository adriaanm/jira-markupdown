I was always in agreement on the solution; I was just proposing a quick hack to solve one of the two problems, but a hack is not a solution :-). But if I were affected by the second issue, I wouldn't mind to have a hack also for it, if there nobody from the Scala maintainers can invest effort in performing a backport and maintenance release. Just a pragmatic approach :-)

Perhaps we should open a distinct ticket requesting for backporting this fixes to the 2.8.x series ?
