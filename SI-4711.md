When I want to enter a unicode code (or an ascii code) with the numpad the REPL is not accepting input.
On my keyboard I have to press Fn + Alt and the 'numeric keyboard plus key' and then the hexadecimal code (the digits may be from the numeric keyboard or the normal digit keys.

The REPL is accepting paste from the clipboard so there is a work around to type it in an editor and copy/paste
it to REPL.
No, it wasn't necessary under windows 7. It is already hexnumpad for the real unicode (the so-called Alt-Plus method). I think that was only necessary for Vista (and reboot your pc).

This issue is only about keying in so if you managed to key a glyph in the repl with the numpad and shows up as a square or a question mark, I am happy too, though I think the REPL source code should be modified to handle numpad event key ins inluding alt combinations.

This issue is not about displaying the glyph (because that is another chapter), but if you want an open source free unicode ttf font for the console you can install DejaVu fonts and use the Sans Mono = sans serif, monospaced (so far this one has the best unicode support as far as I know, maybe there is a unicode font in  windows office but that is not free, if you know a better one I'd like to know):

I use Deja Vu Sans Mono. This is no console font but you can use it as if it were a console font.
Console fonts have special requirements: 
see: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q247815 

The fonts must meet the following criteria to be available in a command session window: 
The font must be a fixed-pitch font.
The font cannot be an italic font.
The font cannot have a negative A or C space.
If it is a TrueType font, it must be FF_MODERN.
If it is not a TrueType font, it must be OEM_CHARSET.
Additional criteria for Asian installations: 
If it is not a TrueType font, the face name must be "Terminal."
If it is an Asian TrueType font, it must also be an Asian character set.

so that is why you cant use every gui font that works for Notepad in the console. Current version of DejaVu Unicode is until version 4.0. Latest Unicode version 6.0 so ot is not upto date with the latest version of Unicode.
Just download from http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page , unzip go to ttf directory select all ttf files, right mouse click install

To make the font working 
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Console\TrueTypeFont\000
You already have 0 and 00 name/value pairs for the default fonts (Consolas and Lucida Console)
If you already have a 000 then you must add an extra 0
Create a name/value pair type REG_SZ
name : 000 
value: DejaVu Sans Mono

In the console properties you have then an extra font to select. For Japanese characters I get squares btw so that doesn't work.

Things that do work in my console:
☆ U+2606  (mathematical kleisli star)
∃ U+2203   (mathematical any symbol)
€ U+20AC   (euro sign currency symbol)

The kleisli star looks a bit to small for this font in comparison with any symbol but it works.

But you can use the unihan Unicode database which has a nice look up interface you can search for code and also paste in an unknown character from which you want to know the unicode:
http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html

Beware that ALT-0-1-6-3 combination is not really an unicode combination but windows 1252 codepage which is equal to unicode and since it is 1 byte only for the first 256 codes (0-255) except for (128-159), so in this case it works.
see http://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/goglobal/cc305145 (the list contains also use cases that probably work with default console fonts)

Since I have a laptop I have the press (Fn) as well to key in on the numpad
So if you have a separate numpad you don't have to do that.
Alt-Plus method keying in unicode:
☆ U+2606  (mathematical kleisli star) (Fn) ALT + 2 6 0 6
∃ U+2203   (mathematical any symbol)   (Fn) ALT + 2 2 0 3
€ U+20AC   (euro sign currency symbol) (Fn) ALT + 2 0 a c

This one below is probably better if you don't want to install a new font, kleisli star and any symbol won't work with default console fonts.
Note also the differences between the different key-ins for the same glyph:
Unicode (Alt-Plus method): ê U+00EA   (e circum flex)   (Fn) ALT + 0 0 e a
Ansi cp 850 on my pc! (old school way): ê       (e circum flex)   (Fn) ALT 1 3 6
Windows cp 1252: ê   (e circum flex)   (Fn) ALT 0 2 3 4

Beware that + is on the numpad, not the other + key above = (on my keyboard)

"For instance I can't get '£' to paste with your clipboard workaround (it get translated to 'ú' instead)."
Then it's still in some ANSI encoding. Convert to utf-8 without bom in notepad++ or another editor capable of converting encodings.

You can check you ansi codepage in the console with chcp. Mine is 850 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_850 . For another it's maybe 437. Sofar I didn't have to change the codepage in the console. It is possible with chcp 65001 (for utf-8) but it is not necessary for this issue. I don't know why but maybe windows recognizes utf-8 encoded bytes in the clipboard.
 
To make the Scala REPL work in unicode utf-8 modify this line in scala.bat and add -Dfile.encoding="UTF-8"
so that it looks:
set _PROPS=-Dscala.home="%_SCALA_HOME%" -Denv.emacs="%EMACS%" -Dfile.encoding="UTF-8"







Thank you for this detailed information. I have Win 7 and I had to add the registry key to enable ALT + input method, so not all Win 7 have it configured by default.

Also after setting _DejaVu Sans Mono_ and file.encoding=UTF-8, I tried the CTRL-V on the following
{code}
val x = "☆"
{code}
but it appears funky on the console:
{code}
val x = "☆"�"
{code}
Oddly, {{x.length == 1}} so the extra garbage seems to only be a printing artifact. You don't get the same behavior? 

What I found out is that jline/jansi relies currently on {{_getch}} which does not detect the ALT unicode combinations (input is just ignored). I tested with a little C program that {{ReadConsoleW}} reads those ALT combination correctly. It does not work either when pasting by using right mouse click.

We would have to modify jansi to use {{ReadConsoleW}}, rebuild and repackage the dll. It probably is going to take a while as well as some help from the jansi maintainer and there may be challenges along the way but I can start down that path...

After some investigation, I found a solution based on adding jni support to jansi for the following calls: {{ReadConsoleInputW}}, {{WriteConsoleW}}, {{GetConsoleOutputCP}}, {{SetConsoleOutputCP}}. I have an open [pull request|https://github.com/fusesource/jansi-native/pull/1] to the jansi maintainer. 

* {{ReadConsoleInputW}} is needed to read the ALT + combinations and it also provides support for right click pastes of non ascii characters. This also allows detecting CTRL-LEFT, CTRL-RIGHT. 
* {{WriteConsoleW}} is needed because {{System.out.println}} or {{java.io.Console}} seem to be broken when double bytes chars are written - this is the extra garbage we see after the unicode chars (☆��)
* {{GetConsoleOutputCP}}, {{SetConsoleOutputCP}} are needed to switch the code page to 65001 and back - which is done if the user is on Windows and {{file.encoding}} is set to {{UTF-8}}.

The changes to jline are mostly in {{AnsiWindowsTerminal}} but changes to {{scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.ILoop}} would be required as well to overwrite {{Console.out}}.

If you want to test it, I can make available a modified version of {{jline.jar}} and you would have to recompile scala from [my github fork|https://github.com/huynhjl/scala-full].
To test

* Install unicode font and enable it for the console (see earlier comments from DaveScala)
* Optionally enable ALT + key input in registry
* Compile scala from my fork in github
* Copy the attached jline jar (see attachments) to {{build\pack\lib\jline.jar}}
* {{set JAVA_OPTS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8}}
* test using {{build\pack\bin\scala.bat}}

I tested it in the recompiled scala 2.10 version and everything seems to work.
Alt-Plus, Alt-Zero and normal Alt keycodes worked and also right mouse pasting and ctrl + v pasting worked without garbage characters.

Just be sure that DejaVu Sans Mono is selected because sometimes windows defaults to Lucida Console font when creating in another directory a new console.

Recompiling scala was difficult because if the settings of -Xmx was to high the jvm was not created and if too low then during creation of scaladoc I had a outofheapspace memory error. Fortunately the binaries were already created so I could test.

chcp 65001 in the console is not really necessary. It worked also when chcp is 850.

jline.jar also works in 2.9.0.1 so recompiling scala was not necessary or is there a special reason to use the latest version of scala? jline.jar looks backward compatible.


Leave this one open. The changes have not been merged in trunk by somebody with commit privileges. The bug is currently assigned to the "community".

* we need the jansi maintainer to build a jansi release incorporating the changes from my pull request
* we need to have confidence we didn't break non win32 behavior and that win32 behavior works on various flavor or Win32 (32 and 64 bits)
* we probably need to build some momentum that this feature is in demand (may be voting up will help)



We're moving to vanilla jline 2.11 in 2.11 -- see https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7604.
Please give it a try!
