At runtime, when initializing, program throws
java.lang.VerifyError: Bad type on operand stack.

The error is very resilient, it persisted through numerous changes as I was minimizing the source. It is extracted from a much bigger project, which compiled successfully under Scala 2.10.3. Then I moved to a different computer with Scala 2.11.1, made some unrelated changes (unrelated to the non-loading class), it compiled and worked. Then moved back to Scala 2.10.3 and it threw java.lang.VerifyError.

In Windows7 I upgraded Java and Scala from 
Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_05)
to
Scala version 2.10.4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_20)
and tried to refactor my project, but the problem persists. I aslo tried IntelliJ Idea+Scala 2.11.1, also crashes. It looks awfully similar to

The attached file is executable as a scalascript, or via SBT run, when you uncomment the package name and comment main() invocation.
Thanks for whittling down to such a small reproduction.

Turns out this is a duplicate of SI-3832, fixed in f04257b / https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2884.
