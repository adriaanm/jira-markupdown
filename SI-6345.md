While scala.util.control.Exception has already been adapted and streamlined with the upcoming scala.util.Try, what about scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.Try?

I just tried and removed it and everything still compiles and all tests pass (except some unrelated issues with instrumented tests on my machine).

Considering that

- the documentation of ScalaRunTime explicitly says “All these methods should be considered outside the API and subject to change or removal without notice.”,
- the code is not documented and
- there doesn't exist a single test for it

shouldn't this code be removed to prevent confusion (imagine people who want to try out Try, and get offered both/the wrong one in IDEs)?
