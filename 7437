Note that `Int` (which is class' specialized type argument) is **upper** bound for `B` in `IntChild#bar`, so the bar's argument `b` **can be** specialized as `Int` and the's no need to box it everywhere in the bar's body. I don't know how hard for current specialization logic is to discover this fact, but without it specialization can do almost nothing for applyOrElse-style partial functions.
