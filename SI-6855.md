in 2.9.2:

Welcome to Scala version 2.9.2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_06).

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

class C {

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

scala>
{noformat}

Note the lack of any compiler error.

The behavior in 2.10.0-RC5 is the same.

Still exists in 2.10.1
Sometimes it can be misleading, for example, I was quite surprised when didn't see any errors on following code snippet (from SO answer http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/15610727/1)

{code}
def Commas(n: Long) = {
if (n >= 1000)
    Commas(n/1000)
{
    print(","+ n%1000/100 + n%100/10 + n%10);
}
 else 
{
    print(n%1000/100 + n%100/10 + n%10);
}
{code}

It might be a nice feature to try adding a closing brace (for case of a missing brace), with the idea that cut/paste is liable to be off-by-one.
