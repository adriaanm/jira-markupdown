Well, from the title of the bug that looks like 'named and default arguments'. And fixing those bugs means defining the correct behaviour for the things your want. So, they are definitely related (and I would say sort of duplicates).

See for example Lukas' comment on scala/bug#3353:
"There's a whole space to explore on the interaction of named/default arguments and pattern matching. If we start doing this, we will end up with this kind of blocks during pattern matching (and btw, blocks don't need to have symbols)."

I didn't close this bug because you kind of rely on the bugs I mentioned. And I guess if we want to be formal SIP would be the proper way.
