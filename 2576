Thanks for submitting the patch. However, I think I found a problem:
{code}
  /* Override to avoid tuple allocation in foreach */
  override def keySet: collection.Set[A] = new DefaultKeySet {
    override def foreach[C](f: A => C) = foreachEntry(_.key)
  }
{code}
In the body of the overridden `foreach` you are never calling `f`. I suppose you want to do
{code}
    override def foreach[C](f: A => C) = foreachEntry(e => f(e.key))
{code}
It seems this should be covered by a test case, which apparently it is not. Could you please revise your patch and add tests for each overridden method? Thanks.
