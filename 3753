So it seems it has to do with removing an element from HashMap$$HashTrieMap.

There are some TODO's in the remove0 method, perhaps these have something to do with it?
{code}
// TODO: might be worth checking if sub is HashTrieMap (-> monomorphic call site)
val subNew = sub.removed0(key, hash, level + 5)
elemsNew(offset) = subNew
// TODO: handle shrinking
{code}
