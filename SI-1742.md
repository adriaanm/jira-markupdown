When doing context help and pressing F2 (for focus), there appear several buttons at the bottom of the context help window. One of them is go-to-declaration. But this button, as all the others is greyed out and does not work. It would be very useful if it did work, though!
Sorry for hijacking. I've created Ticket #2032
