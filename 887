side note: actually I would be great if the following would be allowed in Scala:
```scala
class Array[A]
{
   def projection : RandomAccessSeq [ => A ] = ..
}
```

because this is what it is.

**Note: Of course [=>] would be limited to [+A]!**


If the same would be applied to *List*:
```scala
class List[+A]
{
   def projection : Stream [ => A ] = ..
}
```

It would fix the issue[1009 http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1099] as side-effect.

Of course *List.toStream* should be left as is for performance reasons!
