side note: actually I would be great if the following would be allowed in Scala:

{code}
class Array[A]
{
   def projection : RandomAccessSeq [ => A ] = ..
}
{code}

because this is what it is.

*Note: Of course [=>] would be limited to [+A]!*


If the same would be applied to _List_:

{code}
class List[+A]
{
   def projection : Stream [ => A ] = ..
}
{code}

It would fix the issue[1009 http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1099] as side-effect.

Of course _List.toStream_ should be left as is for performance reasons!
