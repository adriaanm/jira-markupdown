I've been advised to get it out of the 2.9.1 archive, which isn't on the main downloads page.  

P.S.  2.9.1-1 isn't a Version in Jira for some reason.
We're in the process of changing the distribution mechanism.   Scala-tools-support will have their own release cycle in the near future.

For now, they've been removed from the main jars by the sheer fact that the distribution build no longer sees them.  When we get a handle on the distribution process again, they'll show up in a much more user-friendly way.

If you're looking for anything in particular the *most up to date* versions are located here:  https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/tree/master/tool-support
