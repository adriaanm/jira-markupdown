Played around with it a little more--correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the behavior of `break(outer)` kind of nonintuitive in nested loops?  I would naively expect it to immediately break out of the outer context, but it looks to me like it means something like "finish the inner loop, but don't run any more iterations on the outer loop after that".

Except it's a little more fiddly because anything where `break(outer)` is triggered will be filtered out of the inner loop.  So if you *consistently* break on the rest of the inner loop, you actually act as if you broke out of both loops.  But otherwise it acts like a filter only on the last iteration.
