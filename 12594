I bisected the regression (or maybe, the dominant regression) to our removal of scala.concurrent.forkjoin in favour of direct use of the JDK implementation.

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/fa8012d28687986902ce1255a19f9f49affb3bca

In https://github.com/johanandren/akka-ping-pong/compare/master...retronym:embed-akka, I changed Akka dispatcher and mailbox code to j.u.c.ForkJoin directly. This also shows the regression with 2.11.8.

Prior to removing it, our fork of ForkJoin was at:
