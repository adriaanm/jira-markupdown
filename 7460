That depends on your definition of obviously.

As Paul said previously: "A warning might be possible, but it's harder than it looks to warn where you want to without creating spurious warnings elsewhere."

The bug is due to handling case class comparisons like Some.  A simpler example:
{code}
scala> new Some(1) == Some(1)
<console>:8: warning: comparing a fresh object using `==' will always yield false
              new Some(1) == Some(1)
                          ^
res1: Boolean = true
{code}

I can request a pull with a tweak, after I check all the spurious warnings elsewhere, obviously.
