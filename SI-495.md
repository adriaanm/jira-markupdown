```scala
scala> abstract class X
defined class X

scala> case class X1(x:Int) extends X
defined class X1

scala> (new X1(10)) match { case X1(0) => 0; case _ => 1; case X1(10) => 2 }
res4: Int = 2 
```

The last line should raise an "unreachable code" error or match against the second case ( case _ => 1).


The fix doesn't work correctly.  According to my reading of the SLS the following is a valid use of pattern matching and guards.
```scala
def signum(x: Int): Int = x match { case 0 => 0
                                    case _ if x < 0 => -1
                                    case _ if x > 0 => 1}
```
