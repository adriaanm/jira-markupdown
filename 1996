I didn't save the details and I can't seem to reproduce it at a glance (possibly because I get IncompatibleClassChangeErrors before it gets to the crasher) but I didn't open this because I was playing with "$$" identifiers.  Unless we're happy with making reflection unusable, we have to deal with the class names which are reported by such methods as getClass, which are more often than not full of $$s.
```scala
scala> ((1 to 10) map (_ * 2)).getClass
res28: java.lang.Class[_ <: java.lang.Object] = class scala.collection.generic.VectorViewTemplate$$$$anon$$2
```
Also, I am fairly aghast at the casual attitude toward an outright compiler crasher.  Is the goal to build decent software or not?
