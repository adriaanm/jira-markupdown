(Below is copy of a post the forum. Will attach a maven project shortly)

In trying to implement a very simple camel route in scala and have run into a dead-end. First consider this java version:
{code}
public class CamelJavaTyperTest {

    private DefaultCamelContext camel = new DefaultCamelContext();

    private Processor p1 = new Processor() {
        @Override public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception { }
    };
    private Processor p2 = new Processor() {
        @Override public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception { }
    };

    public void init() throws Exception {
        camel.addRoutes(new RouteBuilder() {
            @Override
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                from("somewhere")
                        .process(p1)
                        .process(p2)
                        .to("nowhere");
            }
        });
    }
}
{code}
This compiles fine. Now consider this seemingly identical scala version:
{code}
class CamelScalaTyperTest {

  val camel = new DefaultCamelContext

  val p1 = new Processor { def process(exchange: Exchange) = {} }
  val p2 = new Processor { def process(exchange: Exchange) = {} }

  camel addRoutes new RouteBuilder { override def configure() {
    from ("somwhere")
      .process(p1)
      .process(p2)
      .to("nowhere")
  }}
}
{code}
The scala version results in this compiler error:
{code}
error: something is wrong (wrong class file?): class ProcessorDefinition with type parameters [Type] gets applied to arguments [], phase = typer
.to ("jms:topic:__placeholder__")
{code}
Here is some code that gives a somewhat similar error.  I trimmed off all of the irrelevant parts of this file, so only the error-producing code is here. The only dependency is on the Servlet API 2.x.  This API has some crappiness built into it.  It uses Java containers, but without type parameters.

HttpServlet.getInitParameterNames() returns an Enumeration of Strings, but the API just specifies Enumeration.

Same thing with HttpServletRequest.getParameterNames.

The curious part of this code is that with the two almost identical blocks of code, the first one is in class member scope, while the second is resolved on an object.  The first one fails the compile, the second does not.:

   [scalac] c:\dev\sands\sandsgae\src\sands\server\ScalaServlet.scala:11: error:
 something is wrong (wrong class file?): trait Enumeration with type parameters
[E] gets applied to arguments [], phase = namer
   [scalac]             val name = names.nextElement.asInstanceOf[String]

Please ignore the Windows ugliness.  I tried this on Linux, same thing.

rev. 21306

{code}
import javax.servlet.http._

class ScalaServlet extends HttpServlet
{
    val initParameters =
        {
        var parms = Map[String,String]().withDefaultValue("")
        val names = getInitParameterNames
        while (names.hasMoreElements)
            {
            val name = names.nextElement.asInstanceOf[String]
            parms += name -> getInitParameter(name)
            }  
        parms      
        }

    private def doService(req: HttpServletRequest, resp: HttpServletResponse, user: User) =
        {
        var params = Map[String,String]().withDefaultValue("")
        val names = req.getParameterNames
        while (names.hasMoreElements)
            {
            val name = names.nextElement.asInstanceOf[String]
            params += name -> req.getParameter(name)
            }
        }
}

{code}

As a test, I recoded the error-causing code to be based on an object rather than be in class scope.  It made no difference, the error happened again on names.nextElement(), so I guess that was a false lead:


{code}
class ScalaServlet extends HttpServlet
{
    
    private def getInitParameterMap(svlt: ScalaServlet) =
        {
        var parms = Map[String,String]().withDefaultValue("")
        val names = svlt.getInitParameterNames
        while (names.hasMoreElements)
            {
            val name = names.nextElement.asInstanceOf[String]
            parms += name -> svlt.getInitParameter(name)
            }  
        parms      
        }

    val initParameters = getInitParameterMap(this)

{code}

My workaround is this, but the idea that the previous code failed in the first place but worked in the second still seems like a problem.


{code}
import javax.servlet.http._

class ScalaServlet extends HttpServlet
{
    val initParameters =
        {
        var parms = Map[String,String]().withDefaultValue("")
        val names = getInitParameterNames.asInstanceOf[java.util.Enumeration[String]]
        while (names.hasMoreElements)
            {
            val name = names.nextElement
            parms += name -> getInitParameter(name)
            }  
        parms      
        }


    private def doService(req: HttpServletRequest, resp: HttpServletResponse) =
        {
        var params = Map[String,String]().withDefaultValue("")
        val names = req.getParameterNames.asInstanceOf[java.util.Enumeration[String]]
        while (names.hasMoreElements)
            {
            val name = names.nextElement
            params += name -> req.getParameter(name)
            }
        }
}


{code}

I could not compile the example as given because `User` was not defined. But once I supplied a dummy definition it compiled OK. I verified that `Enumeration` was loaded without problems. I believe that the fix for SI-3349 also fixed this one.
