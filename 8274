You could start by giving me a little credit. I know *exactly* how to get around the warning. The issue is not about the cast.

The bigger issue, which affects my code everywhere is this: The variable `a` is local, and any self-respecting intra-procedural analysis should reflect that `a` is a `Seq[Int]`. It should not need any further ascription, and requiring it should be considered a bug.  This should NOT be an issue of erasure.
