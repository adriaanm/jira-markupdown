A program will not terminate normally until all futures have been evaluated, because creating a future creates an actor, the actor won't shut down until it has produced a value, and the scheduler thread won't shut down until all actors on the scheduler have been exited.

I think this could be fixed by linking the actors used to evaluate futures to a scheduler that runs as a daemon thread.  That's worked for me in creating infinite streams that are asynchronously generated by actors.

Simple code to demonstrate the issue is attached.
Fixed by implementing SI-2015 (r17850).
