Yes.

Specifically, in the case of the `TrieMap`, we could additionally make the invocation atomic *and* make sure that the mapping function is applied only once.
Note that this is not the case with all concurrent map implementations, and the `concurrent.Map` interface will not be able to guarantee this.
