When resolving implicits the compiler seems to include the implcit values defined in package objects for the parent packages of the implicit's type, which does not seem correct to me.

By example I have the following code:

{code:title=MyTest.scala}
package com.acme.test

object MyTest {
  implicitly[com.acme.foo.bar.Bar]
  implicitly[com.acme.foo2.baz.Baz]
}
{code}

And:

{code:title=package.scala}
package com.acme

import com.acme.foo.bar.Bar

package object foo {
  implicit val barImpl: Bar = null
}
{code}

The line {code}implicitly[com.acme.foo.bar.Bar]{code} compiles fine, proving that the compiler found my implicit value barImpl even though I did not import foo._ and MyTest is not in a sub-package of foo. Worse still, if another project links against this code, the compiler complains with errors along the line "bad symbolic reference ...". The root of the problem though is why the implicit value was found in the first place (and if I explcitly import pacakge foo, it still compiles fine and the latter error disappears too).

Note that the on the other hand the compiler does not find the implcit Baz value. The difference being that the only such implicit value I have defined is in a regular object instead of in a package object.

You will find attached a complete sbt project reproducing the error. Just run "sbt clean compile" at the root. 
To exclude the possibility that the error is due to sbt itself, I also compiled it manually (with the same results) using "scalac @scalac-options.txt"
Duplicate of SI-4427, the behaviour is intentional. 
Fair enough. 
For what it's worth, I had actually come across SI-4427 but it did not click that it was the very same situation.
I also had checked the spec of course (my very first step) but the version at scala-lang.org is sadly not up to date and don't mention package objects.

In any case, there is still a bug lying around. As I said I got a "bad symbolic reference ..." error in another project. 
Only when I tried to narrow it down did I encounter the implicit resolution oddness (which I now understand is intentional) which I thought was the real bug (with the "bad symbolic reference" error being some kind of by-product). 
And when adding an explicit import for the implicit value (as opposed to relying on having it in scope by the mere fact of being in the package object), the "bad symbolic reference ..." error got away.

I will try to make another project reproducing the "bad symbolic reference" error and open another bug.
