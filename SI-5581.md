I am develop JMMO project on Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/jmmo/
In attachment there is part of my project. If I run jmmo.engine.AbstractGridSpec (ScalaTest specification)
as is there are many errors on tests. But if I change jmmo.engine.AbstractGrid trait lines 46-50 to this:
{code}
  protected val builderForSet = new CanBuildFrom[IndexedSeq[Int], A, Set[A]] {
                                  def apply(from: IndexedSeq[Int]) = apply()
                                  def apply() = scala.collection.mutable.Set.newBuilder
                                }
  /*withBuilder[IndexedSeq[Int], A, Set[A]](scala.collection.mutable.Set.newBuilder)*/
{code}
then all tests will be Ok. What is the difference between its?
