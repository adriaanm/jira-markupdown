Problem :
Breakpoints set outside {} braces clear when the scala file is trivially edited then saved. The breakpoints disappear from the editor and the Breakpoint window.

Expected outcome :
Breakpoints persist, and behave in the same way as breakpoints inside {} braces

Repro :
 - Create a new scala file
 - Write def main() = 0
 - Save & Set a breakpoint
 - Add a space after the 0, and save again
 - Breakpoint disappears
 - Now replace with :
def main() = {
  0
}
 - Save & set a breakpoint on 0
 - Add a space after the 0
 - Breakpoint persists
