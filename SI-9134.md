Processing a `Stream` using its `withFilter` method evaluates one more element than necessary. When processing a `Stream` using the `filter` method, only the necessary elements are evaluated.

Having a simple `Stream` of natural numbers:
```scala
def naturals: Stream[Int] = {
   def loop(i: Int): Stream[Int] = {
      println(s"evaluate $i")
      i #:: loop(i + 1)
   }


   loop(1)
}
```

Calling `map` on a `Stream` filtered using `filter` vs. `withFilter` produces the same result, however, `withFilter` evaluates one more element:
```scala
scala> naturals filter(_ % 2 == 0) map(x => x) 
evaluate 1
evaluate 2
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(2, ?)

scala> naturals withFilter(_ % 2 == 0) map(x => x)
evaluate 1
evaluate 2
evaluate 3 // this one is eagerly evaluated even though we do not need it
res2: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Steam(2, ?)
```

The behaviour is caused by a call to `tail` in [StreamWithFilter.map](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.5/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/Stream.scala#L539) and the same problem is in `flatMap`.

This is a bug, because the semantics of using `filter` and `withFilter` should be the same; `withFilter` should be only an optimization.  Moreover, the right behaviour is that of the `filter` because the `Stream` operations should be as lazy as possible and in this case there is no reason to evaluate the next element.

As a possible use case where the current behaviour of `withFilter` manifests as a bug consider the following: having a possibly endless stream of attempts to transactionally perform some computation, try to commit it and if the commit is not successful, perform the transaction anew with new current snapshot of data.
```scala
val transAttempts = for {
   trans <- currentTransactionSnapshotStream
   trans.x.increment
   trans.y.decrement
   result = trans.x
   trans.commit
   if (trans.successfullyCommitted)
} yield result

val transactionResult = transAttempts.head
```

The above code will use `withFilter` and possibly perform and commit two times. The expected behaviour is that the transaction would be performed and attempted to commit only until it successfully commits the first time.
See also #8990
I believe that this will also be fixed by the attendant changes to #8990.
See the PR I have so far here: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4284

Essentially, I argue that the WithFilter implementation should absolutely not be re-implementing map/flatMap/foreach, and should implement in terms of a call to #filter followed by the specific call.

Thoughts? I'm happy to add a test of this behavior to the same PR to try to see if we can solve both problems at the same time?
Update: [~aurel.paulovic] can you confirm that this is fixed on the latest build from the 2.12.x branch?

@adriaanm just merged my fix (https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/198c201590d8ab25b0474bf68266714a7542a37d) to #8990. As you can see in the linked fix, `Stream#withFilter` is now essentially little more than a delayed call to `Stream#filter`, so my expectation is that this issue will have been fixed.
Hi [~aurel.paulovic], I believe I've confirmed that this issue is fixed in 2.12.x. Please look at the two tests added in the following PR:
    https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4362

Specifically, here's the test that represents the problem you described:
    https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4362/files#diff-31848830800c360c8f0dccca51aedf56R105
Hi @ms-tg, the patch looks good to me so I would say it is fixed.

I was not able to run the 2.12.x version of it, but since the test fails for me in 2.11.5, and it does not in 2.12.x, it should be ok.
