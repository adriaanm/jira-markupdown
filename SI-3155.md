I'd like to have a `by` in object Ordering, as it is pretty much what I intend everywhere I use `fromLessThan`. Seems pretty straight-forward:

```scala
def by[A, B: Ordering](f: A => B): Ordering[A] = Ordering.fromLessThan((x, y) => implicitly[Ordering[B]].lt(f(x), f(y)))
```
(In r21174) Fixes #3155. No review is necessary.
