(In r23024) Restoring negative literal parsing behavior to what should be
the least surprising option.  Thanks much to Johannes Rudolph for
identifying the bug in the bytecode generator which needed addressing
for us to arrive at proper -0.0 behavior, and for writing the majority
of this patch.

A '-' followed immediately by either a number or a period should
now always be treated as a single numeric literal, which means the
minus binds more tightly than anything else.  A specific example
of how this differs from 2.8 final is:

  -5.+(10) == 5.0   // and not -15.0

The full range of potentially ambiguous parses involving prefix
operators, numbers, and dots is quite large and still needs to be
completely and clearly specified.

Closes scala/bug#2378 and scala/bug#3657, review by odersky, jrudolph.
