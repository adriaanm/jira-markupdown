It is not possible to overload applyDynamic because the name parameter is required to be by itself in the first parameter list:

{code:lang=java}
import language.dynamics

object J {
   val x = new X(3)

   x.call(3,9)

   class X(i: Int) extends Dynamic {
      def applyDynamic(name: String)(in: Int): Int = i + in
      def applyDynamic(name: String)(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
   }
}
```scala

```
J.scala:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method applyDynamic in class X of type (name: String)(a: Int, b: Int)Int
and  method applyDynamic in class X of type (name: String)(in: Int)Int
match argument types (String)
   x.call(3,9)
   ^
{code}
First, if overloading isn't allowed, that should be explicitly checked at definition time so a proper error can be generated.  Structuring the parameter lists to cause an error at the usage site unnecessarily delays feedback to the applyDynamic author.

For overloading being potentially desirable, I figured that the straightforward design of having an actual ApplyDynamic interface with a fixed signature like:

{code:lang=java}
trait ApplyDynamic {
 def applyDynamic(name: String, a: Any*)
}
```scala

was because it was deemed useful to be able to fix the number of arguments and use specific types for the parameters, like:

{code:lang=java}
 def applyDynamic(name: String, a: Int, b: Double)
```

because the compiler will then check whether a call is applicable as usual, saving the applyDynamic author some of the work of checking argument count, types, and giving names to arguments.  So, assuming fixing the parameter count and types is considered useful and given that Scala supports overloading, it seemed odd to have an inconsistency with the rest of Scala here.  Otherwise, why not just define and require the ApplyDynamic interface above?

I didn't mark it as critical, but if there is anything critical about it, I'd guess it might be a decision on what to do, since that could require incompatible changes.
We discussed it at the last Scala meeting and came to the conclusion that we will leave it as is. True, merging the name into the first parameter list supports some valid use cases. But its generalization to multiple parameter lists is ugly.
If you have a call like this:
```scala
    x.foo(y)(z)
```
it seems more regular to map to
```scala
    x.applyDynamic("foo")(y)(z)
```
than to
```scala
    x.applyDynamic("foo", y)(z)
```
About overloading conflicts being detected early, it's not so simple, and we generally don't do that for any overloaded method. E.g. `applyDynamic` might have 
variants with different return types and you could do a return type disambiguation at the call site, so the overloading might be valid after all. It's very hard to find and spec the right rules what a declaration site overloading detector would be. So we don't do it, and I believe Java does not do it either.
I didn't mean general ambiguous overloading detection at the definition site, just disallowing any overloading at all.  I can't come up with an example where overloading works.  For example,

{code:lang=java}
import language.dynamics

object J {
   class X(i: Int) extends Dynamic {
      def applyDynamic(name: String)(i: Int): Double = i + 0.5
      def applyDynamic(name: String)(i: String): String = "i: " + i.toString
   }

   val x = new X(3)
   val y1: String = x.call("adsf")
   val y2: Double = x.call(3)
}
```scala

```
AD.scala:6: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,

and  method applyDynamic in class X of type (name: String)(i: Int)Double

possible cause: maybe a wrong Dynamic method signature?
   val y1: String = x.call("adsf")
                    ^
AD.scala:7: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,

and  method applyDynamic in class X of type (name: String)(i: Int)Double

possible cause: maybe a wrong Dynamic method signature?
   val y2: Double = x.call(3)
                    ^
{code}
I haven't tried this, but I suspect that a macro `applyDynamic` could probably avoid the boxing/varargs tax of an unoverloaded version.
Going to revert the implementation restriction, because I thought of this, which does work given explicit type application:
```scala
import scala.language.dynamics

class A extends Dynamic {
  def applyDynamic[T1](method: String)(x1: T1): Any = 1
  def applyDynamic[T1, T2](method: String)(x: T1, y: T2): Any = 2
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = new A
    println(x[Int](5))
    println(x[Int, String](5, "a"))
  }
}
```
However, I hope this causes people reconsider whether the overloading-hostile structure of applyDynamic makes sense. I think this shows that it does not. With no way to express a variable-length type parameter list, we have again, following in the footsteps of structural types, created a pseudo-general mechanism which is incapable by design of being used in common situations for which it would otherwise be useful, creating unnecessary surprises and friction. There is no way to write a dynamic method which can receive every application of a method name. You could push the above out to N type parameters, but then there's no way to avoid explicit type application.
See also #7059.
It looks like it's possible to overload applyDynamic using Paul's trick from #7059. The trick just needed a single small change!!

```scala
02:00 ~/Projects/Master/sandbox (master)$ cat Test.scala
import scala.language.dynamics

class A extends Dynamic {
  def applyDynamic(method: String): B = new B(method)
}
class B(method: String) {
  def apply(x: Int) = s"$method(x: Int)"
  def apply(x: String) = s"$method(x: String)"
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = new A
    println(x.bippy(42))
    println(x.bippy("42"))
  }
}

02:00 ~/Projects/Master/sandbox (master)$ scalac Test.scala && scala Test
bippy(x: Int)
bippy(x: String)
```
