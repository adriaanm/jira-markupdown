I'm happy this works in Dotty (didn't check), but it doesn't seem to be valid Scala according to Scalac 2.11.2:
{code}
scala> trait B extends A[_ <: B]
<console>:20: error: illegal cyclic reference involving trait B
       trait B extends A[_ <: B]
                         ^
<console>:20: error: class type required but A[_ <: B] found
       trait B extends A[_ <: B]
                       ^
{code}

Gotta think more on other points.
