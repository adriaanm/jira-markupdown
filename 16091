I moved test/files/jvm/interpreter.scala to pending for now. It stops running on more and more machines because default heap size is not enough for it. It seems that my addition of 55 bridge forwarder methods and 5 new interfaces pushed it over the edge here. We should find pass a sufficient heapsize to the subprocess that runs the interpreter and then bring the test back.
