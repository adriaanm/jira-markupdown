scalac drops an empty argument to -cp, using the next argument instead.  For example, in the following command line, it uses A.scala as the classpath and only B.scala is a source file.

```scala
scalac -cp "" A.scala B.scala
```

You can verify this by creating A.scala and B.scala as follows:

A.scala
```scala
class A
```

B.scala
```scala
class B extends A
```

A won't be found when scalac compiles B.  This is a regression from 2.8.1
(extempore in [r25376](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25376)) Discard empty strings in option position, but not in argument position.
Closes #4782, no review.
