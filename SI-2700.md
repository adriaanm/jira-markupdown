I understand that when compiling guards in for comprehensions, filter will be called if withFilter is not defined.

Unfortunately, it seems that explicit calls to withFilter are also being transformed to calls of filter. 

{code}
          def empty = Iterator.range(0, 10).
                       withFilter(isEven _).
                       withFilter(isOdd _)

{code}
{code}
warning: `withFilter' method does not yet exist on Iterator,
using `filter' method instead
{code}

IMHO a compiler error should be reported instead.
