This is a (severe) regression from 2.10 and almost certainly my doing with the name based pattern matcher. Despite that I hope everyone understands I'm not on the hook for the rest of my life to fix all the bugs which can be traced back to me. I'll fix this if I can do it easily, but you should assume that I won't.

In what must be my 100th time feeling this way, each time thinking it will be the last, I am freshly boggled that there are no tests which cover this. Though I guess the pattern matcher for most of its existence was a fountainhead of wrongness if you mixed extractors and case classes, so there wasn't much point in testing that until it was reborn of moors.
{code}
// As an extractor it compiles:
// class Precise(val size: Int) ; object Precise { def unapply(x: Precise) = Some(x.size) }
case class Precise(size: Int)

object Outer { def unapply(x: Any): Option[Precise] = None }
class Bug { def f(x: Any) = x match { case Outer(Precise(x)) => x } }

/**
a.scala:8: error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : Precise
 required: Int
class Bug { def f(x: Any) = x match { case Outer(Precise(x)) => x } }
                                                 ^
