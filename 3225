Oh, and hopefully I don't have to say this, but please don't interpret the fact that I reverted the lines in the above example as in any way invalidating this bug.  It's the opposite, this bug may have stood between me and a solution to SI-2876.  Not for sure, but it's irrelevant because this bug is real and reproducible: but you might need to check out r20482 to easily reproduce it.
