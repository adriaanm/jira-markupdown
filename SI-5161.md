'scala' command line tool is very useful as a linux script executor. Unfortunately it supports only one file which, can be passed as argument. But I think that in more advance system scripting it is very common to want to refactor part of scripts into separate source unit. For example I have few scripts in bash for backing up my system, but calculating paths is common part and is in separate file mirror-config.sh.

As I said before I can not do it easily using Scala as I can not provide more than one scala source file.

My current (imperfect) solution is as follows:

scala-utils.scala -> contains some common utilities for scripting
test.sh -> main script in scala wrapped in bash

test.sh file:
---------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
source /root/bin/boot-scala.sh
!#

import java.io.File
import utils.Timer

object App {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val timer = new Timer

    timer.start
    println("Executing '%s' in directory '%s'".format(args(1), args(0)))
    println("There are %d arguments passed to script.".format(args.length))
    println(args.mkString(" "))

    println("Time elapsed: " + timer.elapsed)
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------

boot-scala file:
---------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
SCRIPT="$(cd "${0%/*}" 2>/dev/null; echo "$PWD"/"${0##*/}")"
DIR=`dirname "${SCRIPT}"}`
CP="/tmp/scala-cp/"
if [ ! -d $CP ]; then
  mkdir /tmp/scala-cp
  scalac -d $CP $DIR/*.scala
fi
exec scala -savecompiled -classpath $CP $0 $DIR $SCRIPT $@
---------------------------------------------------

As you can see in boot-scala.sh, I am extracting SCRIPT name and DIR name and then these values are passed to scala.
Problem is that I can only provide classpath to scala tool, so I have to compile manually my scala-utils.scala file and put classes into arbitrary /tmp/scala-cp.

If scala tool could have another command line argument e.g. -sources, then I could provide other files directly without making such a strange hacks.

Also it would be nice if compiled *.jar files could be stored in some internal scala directory, so they are not cluttering my scripts directory.
