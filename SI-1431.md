I got the compiler exception quoted in the subject.

The triggering code is as follows:
{code}
object Bug_New {
  trait MyTrait {
    type Alpha
    def the_value : Alpha
    class Factory() {def value : Alpha = the_value}
  }

  def fun[X<:MyTrait with Singleton]() = new X#Factory().value
}
{code}

(scalac versions: 2.7.1.final & build from trunk.)

(extempore in [r25276|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25276]) Catch type projections even when they disguise themselves as
stable via singleton bounds.  Closes #1431, review by odersky.
