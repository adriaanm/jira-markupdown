```scala
var a = 0
var b = 0L
a += (b >>> 32)
```

What is the expected behavior?

The code should either just work (like in Java) or result in 
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Long
 required: Int
```


What do you see instead?
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long <: Any): ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2float in object Predef of type (x: Int)Float
 and method int2double in object Predef of type (x: Int)Double
 are possible conversion functions from Int to ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long <: Any): ?}
       var a = 0; var b = 0L; a += (b >>> 32)
                              ^
```
