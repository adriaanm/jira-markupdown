That's a pretty titanic bug.  Look at what it did to the statistics -- uniquetypes is reporting size, I added uniquetypes2 to count what's really in there.

{code}
[scalacfork] *** Cumulative statistics at phase cleanup
[...]
[scalacfork] #uniquetypes : 2242323
[scalacfork] #uniquetypes2: 962323
{code}

Sadly no performance improvement that I can see, but maybe that's because I'm nowhere near memory bound.

I'll fix it shortly.
