In a linked-list structure with hetrogeneous values the type parameter used to reference the neighbouring link seems to deliver insufficient information to the compiler.  The result is that the compiler refuses to recognize that the structure can be traversed safely.

Enclosed is a small class (Link.scala) that doesn't compile.  The problem is with line 13.

{code}
package rule

case class Link[T, T2 <: Link[_,_]] (val value : T, val next : T2) {
	
	def cons [T3](value2 : T3) : Link[T3, Link[T, T2]] = {
		val result = new Link(value2, this)
		result
	}
	
	def matches(other : Link[T, T2]) : Boolean = {
			this.value == other.value &&
			/* following line does not compile */
		this.next.matches(other.next)
	}
}

object End extends Link[Option[Nothing], Link[Option[Nothing],_]](None, null){
	override def matches(other : this.type) = true
}
{code}
{{this.next}} and {{other.next}} are distinct instances of {{T2 <: Link[_, _]}}. The compiler is doing the right thing by *not* unifying the existentials.

Here's a smaller example of the same:

{code}
scala> case class Box[A](var a: A)
defined class Box

scala> type T = Box[_]
defined type alias T

scala> def foo(t1: T, t2: T) = t1.a = t2.a
<console>:10: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (some other)_$1(in type T)
 required: _$1(in type T)
       def foo(t1: T, t2: T) = t1.a = t2.a
                                         ^
{code}

Could you please address followup discussions to [scala-language]? You might also be interested into the implementation of similar structures within the library shapeless, https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/blob/shapeless-1.2.3/core/src/main/scala/shapeless/hlist.scala#L24
