(Gen)TraversableOnce.toIterator is overridden in TraversableLike as {toStream.iterator}. But for Iterables, this should just be {iterator}.

Should be easy win, but as a motivator example, the following is inefficient (due to the intermediate Stream):

```scala
def izip[A,B](xs: TraversableOnce[A], ys: TraversableOnce[B]) =
  xs.toIterator zip ys.toIterator
```

and must be expanded to:

```scala
def izip[A,B](xs: Iterable[A], ys: Iterable[B]) =
  xs.iterator zip ys.iterator
def izip[A,B](xs: Iterator[A], ys: Iterable[B]) =
  xs zip ys.iterator
def izip[A,B](xs: Iterable[A], ys: Iterator[B]) =
  xs.iterator zip ys
def izip[A,B](xs: Iterator[A], ys: Iterator[B]) =
  xs zip ys
// .. and more needed to handle Traversables as well
```
(extempore in [r25302](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25302)) Make IterableLike.toIterator more efficient

Override TraversableLike.toIterator which uses unnecessary toStream.
