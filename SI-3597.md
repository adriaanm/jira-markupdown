1) Nil.transpose shouldn't fail.  (The implementation calls head.)

2) I think transpose should throw an exception anytime the elements aren't all of the same size (see also SI-3399.) That is my plan unless someone mounts a campaign against it.
I agree strongly on point 1.

Instead throwing an exception why not add a lazy parameter that can be used for holes. Then do overload the function with no parameter list or name the other one transposeWithHoleValue (gets around currying amibuigities) and use `error("Need to provide a value for holes when calling transpose on jagged lists").`

If you go the default parameter route you'd have to call list.transpose() with the parens which is a little annoying.

Then if desired people could do: 
`xs  map(Some(_)) transposeWithHoleValue None`

(In r23016) Made transpose not fail on an empty collection.  References SI-3597,
but remains open until we determine how to handle jagged lists.  No review.
(In r24305) Rediscovering that transpose sometimes throws an exception on irregular
lists and sometimes returns an irregular result (depending on whether the
first collection is the longest or not) indicated that this needs a better
resolution than the status quo.  Determination: as long as we're throwing
an exception on any invalid input, we should throw an exception on all
invalid input, so that's what it does now.  I postpone any attempt to offer
a variation accepting a "hole value".  Closes SI-3597, review by community.
