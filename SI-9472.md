Because of #3101, some triple-quoted strings in the source code for Scala have different line endings depending on how the source files are checked out of version control. This then causes failures because the additional CR characters cause (e.g.) String.equals or String.contains checks to fail.

Affected files include:
- test/junit/scala/io/SourceTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/reflect/internal/PrintersTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/analysis/NullnessAnalyzerTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/opt/InlineWarningTest.scala
- test/junit/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/opt/InlinerTest.scala
```
 check out source files using LF line endings.
```

Nitpick: they should checkout with unaltered line endings. Some files in our repo have CRLF line endings:

```
âš¡ file src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/templates/tool-windows.tmpl
src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/templates/tool-windows.tmpl: ASCII English text, with CRLF line terminators
```
My aliases on cygwin always included
```
-Dline.separator=$'\n'
```
to help mitigate one form of mixed line endings.
A better solution than to rely on manual instruction could be to change the normalisation in .gitattributes

Currently it has 

- text=auto

which will set all files to auto text, meaning on check out it converts all line endings to core.eol, and on check in convert all line endings to lf. For anyone who has core.eol set to anything but lf that would spell trouble.

I'm no git wizard, but shouldn't changing that line to 

- eol=lf

do the trick? If it does, it seems like a better solution than to tell all windows users to config their core.eol for this repo.

In response to Jasons nitpick: The *-windows.tmpl files (as well as .cmd and .bat) are already set to eol=crlf in .gitattributes
Yes, I agree that `eol=lf` in .gitattributes seems like the way to go. (I have been looking into this as well and arrived at the same conclusion.) I've been waiting to put together a pull request until I can verify that all tests are passing on Windows, so if any additional changes are needed, I can include them too.
It looks to me like `eol=lf` supplements rather than replaces `text=auto`. The former affects working copies, the latter affects commits.
