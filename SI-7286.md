Given this comment:

```
  /** Sets sync var `response` to doc comment information for a given symbol.
   *
   *  @param   sym        The symbol whose doc comment should be retrieved (might come from a classfile)
   *  @param   source     The source file that's supposed to contain the definition
   *  @param   site       The symbol where 'sym' is observed
   *  @param   fragments  All symbols that can contribute to the generated documentation
   *                      together with their source files.
   *  @param   response   A response that will be set to the following:
   *                      If `source` contains a definition of a given symbol that has a doc comment,
   *                      the (expanded, raw, position) triplet for a comment, otherwise ("", "", NoPosition).
   *  Note: This operation does not automatically load sources that are not yet loaded.
   */
```

the parsed comment doesn't contain the last "Note" body.
