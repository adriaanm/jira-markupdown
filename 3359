I now have a concrete patch.  Drum roll please!
```scala
-class ArraySeq[A](override val length: Int)
+class ArraySeq[@specialized A](override val length: Int)
```
Ta da.
```scala
scala> new collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int](5)
res0: scala.collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Int] = ArraySeq(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

scala> new collection.mutable.ArraySeq[Float](5) mkString
res1: String = 0.00.00.00.00.0
```
