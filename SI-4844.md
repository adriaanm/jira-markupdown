I can't tell for sure because I'm using a home-brewed version of sbt 0.7.7 (because of the compability problems) but when I then run the console command, neither Ctrl-D nor Ctrl-C work any more. This may well be an sbt issue, I just put it here for reference.
ctrl-C doesn't work? That's a new one.  Maybe related somehow to SI-4705, which I also don't understand.
Oh, and there is a ctrl-C-not-working report in SI-4705.
This appears to be caused by SI-4705.  Whatever ctrl-C does, it can't overcome the leftover thread.  This issue could be interpreted to be a request to unregister the interrupt handler after the interpreter thinks it has exited.  Otherwise, I don't think there is a separate issue here.
