In 2.8.0, docs for Dialog declare closeOperation() as 'This method is called when the window is closing, after all other window event listeners have been processed.'  This method is never called.

To test:
```scala
import swing._

class TestDialog extends Dialog {
	override def closeOperation() { println("closing...") }
}

val d = new TestDialog()
d.visible = true
```

When the dialog is closed, nothing is printed.  (Can also verify with breakpoints.)

RichWindow.scala already has code to call closeOperation for swing.Frame, and this Chould be used for Dialog as well:
```scala
80	  protected trait SuperMixin extends JFrame {
81	    override protected def processWindowEvent(e: java.awt.event.WindowEvent) {
82	      super.processWindowEvent(e)
83	      if (e.getID() == java.awt.event.WindowEvent.WINDOW_CLOSING)
84	        closeOperation()
85	    }
86	  }
```
