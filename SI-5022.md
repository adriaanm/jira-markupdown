A case class which wraps an existential type seems to lose type information.

{code}
class ForSomeVsUnapply {

    class X[e]

    case class Wrap(rep: (e, X[e]) forSome { type e })

    def makeWrap: Wrap = throw new Error("todo")
    def useRep[e](rep: (e, X[e])) = ()

    val Wrap(rep) = makeWrap
/*
[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : (Any, ForSomeVsUnapply.this.X[_1]) where type _1
[error]  required: (Any, ForSomeVsUnapply.this.X[Any])
[error]     useRep(rep) // error
[error]            ^
[error] one error found
*/
    useRep(rep) // error

    useRep(makeWrap.rep) // ok
}
{code}
If it helps, the bug seems to be in the pattern matcher custom unapply.  If you use the synthetic unapply in the companion (which the matcher doesn't use, but generates for uniformity) it retains the relationship.
{code}
  val Some(rep) = Wrap.unapply(makeWrap)
  // val Wrap(rep) = makeWrap
{code}

WIP: https://github.com/retronym/scala/tree/ticket/5022

See my elaboration in the commit comment. I suggest that we should not be calling {{dropExistential}} on the expected type when typechecking in pattern mode. This is mostly a gut feeling; I'm interested to know (and document) why it is the right thing to do in other cases.

Nice. I wonder how/whether the change impacts some other tickets: SI-2613, SI-5579, SI-5585, SI-6541, SI-6587, SI-6680.
SI-2613 is the same bug as this one; I've merged them. The others are distinct.
