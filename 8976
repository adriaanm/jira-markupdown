My original use-case was for string interpolation on a dollar-prefixed string, e.g.
```scala
val money = $"100.00"
```

which, given the paucity of spare symbols on my keyboard, *seems* reasonable to me (bearing in mind I'm selfish)... ;)

And I'm sadly not allowed this either:
```scala
val money = Â£"100.00"
```
