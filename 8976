My original use-case was for string interpolation on a dollar-prefixed string, e.g.
{code}
val money = $"100.00"
{code}

which, given the paucity of spare symbols on my keyboard, _seems_ reasonable to me (bearing in mind I'm selfish)... ;)

And I'm sadly not allowed this either:
{code}
val money = Â£"100.00"
{code}
