It seems SeqLike#lastIndexOfSlice will not work correctly on scala 2.8RC2,
{code}
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC2 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.
  
scala> "axxb" lastIndexOfSlice "xx"
res0: Int = -1

scala> "axxb" lastIndexOfSlice("xx", "axxb".length)
res1: Int = 1
{code}

That method has been defined as followsr1,
{code}
def lastIndexOfSlice[B >: A](that: Seq[B]): Int = lastIndexOfSlice(that, that.length)
{code}

I guess the following change will fix it.
{code}
def lastIndexOfSlice[B >: A](that: Seq[B]): Int = lastIndexOfSlice(that, length)
{code}

(In r21987) Bug in lastIndexOfSeq.  Closes SI-3455, no review.
