Here's the test case:

{code}
import scala.{specialized => spec}
class C[@spec(Int) A](a:A) {
  lazy val b = (a, a)
  def c = b
}
object Test {
  def main(args:Array[String]) {
    println(new C(3).c)
    println(new C(3.0).c)
  }
}
{code}

Expected output:

{code}
(3,3)
(3.0,3.0)
{code}

Actual output:

{code}
null
(3.0,3.0)
{code}

The problem seems to be that the specialized subclass doesn't get its own bitmap... it just assumes its lazy val field has already been initialized. I'm not really an expert on lazy val, but barring deeper changes (e.g. not duplicating vals between generic class and specialized subclass) I think we need to copy the bitmask and the code in b that checks it.


So, I have a small update.

As I said in the last comment, the LAZY flag was being removed. In addition, the ACCESSOR flag was also being removed. Once I got those fixed, I moved on to the next error (I have attached a patch that fixes that issue).

At that point, the problem is that C$mcI$sp.b$mcI$sp() isn't given the same "lazy method" block that C.b() has. This causes a MatchError in the mixin phase later. Compare:

{code}
// generic b() is fine
class C ... {
    <method> <stable> <accessor> lazy <triedcooking> def b(): scala.this.Tuple2[A,A] = {
      C.this.b = new scala.this.Tuple2[A,A].<init>(C.this.a, C.this.a);
      C.this.b
    };
}

// specialized b$mcI$sp() is broken
class C$mcI$sp ... {
    <method> <stable> <accessor> lazy <specialized> <triedcooking> def b$mcI$sp(): scala.this.Tuple2[scala.this.Int,scala.this.Int] = C$mcI$sp.this.b$mcI$sp;
}
{code}

I think that if we can get the body of b$mcI$sp() to look more like the body of b(), which really just means assigning a tuple to the b$mcI$sp field, then things might work.

Looking into this further.
