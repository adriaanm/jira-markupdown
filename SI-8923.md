Why?

{code}
object Foo { def foo[A]: (A*) => A = as => as.head }
{code}

ok:
{code}
scala> Foo.foo(1,2,3)
res1: Int = 1
{code}

not ok:
{code}
scala> import Foo.foo; foo(1,2,3)
<console>:10: error: too many arguments for method apply: (v1: Seq[A])A in trait Function1
        foo(1,2,3)
           ^
{code}

Relates to SI-5991. The compiler allows more than the spec when it comes to T* types, we probably should *only* allow them on method parameters, not on function params.

See also SI-4176.
Ok, so you're thinking it shouldn't work in *either* case.  I was just really surprised that the "import" version would result in a different call or different inference or different *anything* compared to the qualified version.
