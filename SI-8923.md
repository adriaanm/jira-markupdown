Why?

```scala
object Foo { def foo[A]: (A*) => A = as => as.head }
```

ok:
```scala
scala> Foo.foo(1,2,3)
res1: Int = 1
```

not ok:
```scala
scala> import Foo.foo; foo(1,2,3)
<console>:10: error: too many arguments for method apply: (v1: Seq[A])A in trait Function1
        foo(1,2,3)
           ^
```
Relates to #5991. The compiler allows more than the spec when it comes to T* types, we probably should **only** allow them on method parameters, not on function params.

See also #4176.
Ok, so you're thinking it shouldn't work in **either** case.  I was just really surprised that the "import" version would result in a different call or different inference or different **anything** compared to the qualified version.
