at package scala.xml.transform you've got 3 classes
```scala
abstract class BasicTransformer extends Function1[Node,Node]
class RuleTransformer extends BasicTransformer
class RewriteRule extends BasicTransformer 
```

I think you can make RewriteRule as separate abstract class, because it is inheritance isn't necessary and overcomplicate code.
