Replying to [comment:6 odersky]: 
> 1) I learned a rule from Corky Cartwright that you should never compare against null. The idea is that `null' should mean undefined value, not something you can test for. So it's OK to pass null as a don't care parameter, say, but nobody should ever test for null.

May I ask (and I realize the scala compiler has been written by numerous people and that your team is overworked, I'm not intending to be judgmental) if this is something you hope/intend to address? The widespread usage of null in the scala source has been something of a disappointment to me.
```scala
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep '!= null'  |wc -l
     211
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep '== null'  |wc -l
     141
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep 'ne null'  |wc -l
     282
jon:scala paulp$$ find src -name '*.scala' |xargs grep 'eq null'  |wc -l
     215
```
