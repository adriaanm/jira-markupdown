The Scaladoc for Iterable lists several methods with the note "will not terminate for infinite collections".  In several cases this is not necessarily true.  For example, map on an infinite stream is just fine:
{code}
  Stream.from(0).map(x => x*x)
{code}
It is good to give the "will not" and "may not" terminate comments, because these are a true hazard when processing an arbitrary Iterable.  However, currently these comments are applied to too many methods.

I am just saying it depends on the particular method.  With map, for example, I don't think *any* subclasses both define it strictly and support infinite collections.  Certainly Stream and Iterator do not.

For find, on the other hand, the comment is accurate.  So it depends on the particular method.
For the default implementations of map or filter present in Iterable, they will definitely not terminate on infinite collections. All infinite collections should be projections and they should override map and filter (although sometimes we can't override filter). I guess we could put a giant disclaimer at the top of Iterable saying that if the collection is or could be infinite, it should inherit from Projection and overridden certain methods (map, filter, and so on...).
