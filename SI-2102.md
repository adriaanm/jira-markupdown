On StackOverflow at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1054571/converting-enumeration-to-iterator/1054996SI-1054996 a user got the following error message and didn't immediately see that the problem was an expected scala.Iterator instead of the java.util.Iterator he was passing.

`type mismatch; found : java.util.Iterator[?0] 
   where type ?0 <: java.util.zip.ZipEntry 
   required: Iterator[?]`

It's my belief that the error message would have been much more clear to the user if the error message had been

`type mismatch; found : java.util.Iterator[?0] 
   where type ?0 <: java.util.zip.ZipEntry 
   required: scala.Iterator[?]`
