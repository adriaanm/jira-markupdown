Turns out my canary was placed on the wrong part of the coal mine. By changing it to duplicate the trees **after** type checking, all of the problems with inspecting `context.tree` evaporated. Thanks for Lukas and Eugene for helping out with this.

That did leave a few legitimate failures, such as neg/t5696.scala and pos/t5720-ownerous.scala.

The updated patch:
