Just for the record, I'd like to record one vote against removing the procedure syntax.

I may be the only one but I use procedure syntax for situations where I do not intend to return anything, reserving the "normal" syntax for places where a value is returned. I personally find a benefit from having the two different syntaxes to indicate these two situations and I haven't experienced any issues or confusions from having both.
