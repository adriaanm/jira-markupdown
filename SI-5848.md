This results in bad performance (O(n*n)) because the map needs constant copying. It may also result in a map of a different run time type, depending on the implementation of the initial map.

I think the requirement for the type parameter should be raised to mutable.Map so that the += operator of the MapBuilder can call the += operator of the map to build. At least, that would be straightforward logical.
Well, the issue that concerns me is that MapBuilder is a member of the package collection.mutable, so one should safely assume that it would work well for mutable maps, but unfortunately it doesn't.

One way to work around this issue without raising the bar for the type parameter of the collection is to do a runtime test along these lines:

```scala
coll match {
  case map: collection.mutable.Map => map += ...
  case _ => coll = coll + ...
}
```

Ideally, you would do this case distinction only once, not on every iteration. You might want to apply the state pattern for this.
Normally, mutable maps use themselves as builders.

The `mutable.MapBuilder` is in the `mutable` package because builders are mutable data structures.
The class itself is however **used** by the maps in the `immutable` package, because it provides an efficient way to build immutable maps.
Other than changing the name MapBuilder to something else, or restricting the `mutable.MapBuilder` type parameter to take only immutable maps, I don't see much that can be done.
Note that changing the type parameter is problematic, since it causes backwards compatibility problems. We could introduce a `MutableMapBuilder` and an `ImmutableMapBuilder`, however.
Just imagine a call to collection.mutable.Map.map where the return type is another mutable map with different type parameters:

```scala
import collection._
val intMap: mutable.Map[String, Int] = ...
val stringMap: mutable.Map[String, String] = intMap map { case (s, i) => s -> i.toString }
```

Then the compiler will inject the implicit collection.mutable.Map.canBuildFrom which will in turn use the collection.mutable.MapBuilder. Now if intMap has a large number of entries n, then the damage is done due to the O(n*n) runtime.

I agree that changing the type parameters of collection.mutable.MapBuilder is not good, but how about applying my sketched patch above?
I don't think that's true:

```scala




import collection._
import generic._



object Test {
  
  implicit def decorator[K, V](m: mutable.Map[K, V]) = new {
    def revealingTransform[S, That](f: (K, V) => S)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[mutable.Map[K, V], S, That]): That = {
      println(cbf.getClass)
      println(cbf(m).getClass)
      
      null.asInstanceOf[That]
    }
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val intMap: mutable.Map[String, Int] = mutable.Map("one" -> 1)
    val stringMap: mutable.Map[String, String] = intMap.revealingTransform({
      case (s, i) => s -> i.toString
    })
  }
  
}
```

The above prints:

```scala
class scala.collection.generic.GenMapFactory$MapCanBuildFrom
class scala.collection.mutable.HashMap
```

but let me double check.
I really don't think that's the case. Every mutable map companion should inherit `MutableMapFactory`. The below override in that class prevents the situation you've described from happening.

```scala
  /** The default builder for $Coll objects.
   *  @tparam A      the type of the keys
   *  @tparam B      the type of the associated values
   */
  override def newBuilder[A, B]: Builder[(A, B), CC[A, B]] = empty[A, B]
```

Could you post the exact code snippet which resolves to the incorrect builder?
