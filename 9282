I'd agree that the proposed change would make things saner w.r.t. to alignment between parameterless methods and methods with an empty parameter list, so sounds like a good thing. Just wanted to point out that the description

> There's no upside to it. Empty application cannot hurt eta expansion, but eta expansion can hurt empty application.

doesn't seem quite correct. E.g. here's an example (similar to the one [~retronym] gave in a previous comment) of code that would no longer compile:

{code}
class Gate {
  def unary_+(): Gate = this
}
val gate = new Gate
def foo(f: () => Gate) = 1

foo(+gate) // currently compiles but would fail if empty application were applied
{code}
