It seems to me that -version should behave the same as other info messages like -Xshow-phases or -help.

I would refactor -version to CompilerCommand to enforce that uniformity.

Then the question is whether the current behavior is useful.  I'm not sure why scalac differs from the runner, but arguably scalac -version foo.scala && scala Foo means I think my file was recompiled if it is run. I just wanted to make sure I always use the correct version of the compiler.

Similarly, scala -Xshow-phases foo.scala && scala bar.scala just means I want to verify some info in the middle of the compound command.

Maybe it needs the equivalent of -Xfatal-warnings, such as -Xfatal-info for the current behavior.
