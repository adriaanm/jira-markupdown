In 2.9, when the copy method had defaults for all parameter lists, having a repeated parameter in any of the lists would prevent the copy method from being generated, since repeated parameters and default arguments can't coexist (though this isn't explicitly spec'd, see #4783). Now that #5009 makes copy return a function type instead of being a multi-param list method, I don't see why it shouldn't be generated if parameter lists after the first one have repeated parameters.

E.g.:
```scala
case class Foo(a: Int)(b: String*)
```

should get a method
```scala
def copy(a: Int = this.a): (String*) => Foo
```
`(String*) => Foo` is not a valid function type, unfortunately..
#3652
```scala
case class SureItIs(a: Int)(b: String*) {
  def copy(a: Int = this.a): (String*) => SureItIs = new ((String*) => SureItIs) {
    def apply(b: String*) = SureItIs(a)(b:_*)
  }
}
```

It's just not a valid **anonymous** function type, but it is most assuredly a valid type.
The spec is actually bit lacking in this area. This is syntactically allowed, but there is no mention on how it should be type checked. Is {{((Animal*) => Any)}} a subtype of {{((Dog*) => Any)}}? Of {{Seq[Animal] => Any}}? 

All we are told is that:

```
The type of such a repeated parameter inside the method is then the sequence type scala.Seq[T].
```

By name parameters are similarly underspecced.
Lukas is correct.  In 2.10 you can still get away with typing in the above (it's more broken in 2.9) but the copy method is not assigned the type (String*) => SureItIs, it is given the type Seq[String] => SureItIs.

The varargs star can only appear in method types, not function types.
```scala
scala> def f(xs: String*): Int = 5
f: (xs: String*)Int

scala> f _
res0: Seq[String] => Int = <function1>

scala> class A { def g: ((String*) => Int) = f _ }
defined class A

scala> (new A).g _
res1: () => Seq[String] => Int = <function0>
```
It is definitely underspecified, but I'm drawing on additional sources of information to make this assessment.  It'd be nice if we were all working from the same spec sheet, yes.
Paul: I get that eta-expansion never produces a function type containing a repeated parameter, but such function types are still valid value types, yes? I can still write

```scala
val f: (String*) => Int = new ((String*) => Int) {
  def apply(xs: String*) = 5
}

f("hello", "world")
```

Not a method type to be seen, just an anonymous class implementing a valid value type.

Jason: I agree that the conformance relation of function types with repeated parameters is underspecified. The existence of those types, however, seems less ambiguous:

Syntax:
```
Type         ::= FunctionArgs '=>' Type
FunctionArgs ::= '(' [ ParamType {',' ParamType } ] ')'
ParamType    ::= Type '*'
```

Semantics:
```
Function types are shorthands for class types that define {{apply}} functions.
```

(In particular, this does not say "function types are shorthands for method types".)

So since Any { def apply(xs: String*): Int } is a valid (value, not method!) type, ((String*) => Int) is as well, right?
You can't write it in 2.10.
```scala
scala> val f: (String*) => Int = new ((String*) => Int) { def apply(xs: String*) = 5 }
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String* => Int
 required: Seq[String] => Int
```
It's pointless to debate it too much because all we can do is chase angels around the head of a pin.  What we need is a clear statement, not to be spending our time parsing and reparsing the spec hoping it will suddenly become unambiguous through spontaneous disambiguation.
The boat I'm in is a lot more like the boat you're in than you probably think.  I'm no longer willing to spend time on this sort of issue because it's nothing but blank walls, dead ends, and stairways to nowhere.  If you have an idea how to see some kind of progress you should pursue it, because that idea already puts you ahead of me.
