It would be nice if I could ask the repl to javap synthetic artifacts using less than the raw name.

It's possible to do the raw name, by javap -raw Foo to see what the raw names are, and then pasting.

One easy shortcut is to support javap -app Test to mean show me Test$delayedInit$body.

Maybe there are similar mnemonics for anonfuns.

Also, Foo#bar filters for member bar, and -fun Foo#bar shows anonfuns pertaining to bar, while -fun Foo# shows all funs for Foo but filters for apply (since that is often the member of interest).  -app Test# shows the apply of the DelayedInit, i.e., the init code proper. After a def m, javap #m shows only m.
