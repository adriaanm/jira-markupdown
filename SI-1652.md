Since upgrading to Scala 2.7.2, I have been getting an occasional and unpredictable 'timer' error when using Actor.reactWithin.

{code}
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Timer already cancelled.
{code}

It was hard to debug my program directly, so I looked at the {{scala.actors}} source to see if I could find any possible causes. I found one problem. Hopefully it is the same one as I'm seeing in my program!

The exception message gives a good clue, so I looked at when the Timer is cancelled.
This happens in {{FJTaskScheduler2}} when {{ActorGC.allTerminated}} is true.
ActorGC counts current reactions to work out whether any actors are live.
This count is incremented when an actor starts,
and decremented when it becomes unreachable or terminates.

Unfortunately, the lifetime of {{ActorProxy}} instances don't seem to be captured properly.
This is because {{ActorGC.newActor}} isn't called when they're created.
Even if it were called, I'm not sure how we could find out when the {{ActorProxy}} terminates...

Anyway, the following code demonstrates the problem:

{code}
import scala.actors.Actor
class ReactWithinThread extends Thread {
  override def run() = {
    Actor.reactWithin(1) { case x => () }
  }
}
(new ReactWithinThread).start
Thread.sleep(1000) // Wait for scheduler to poll ActorGC
(new ReactWithinThread).start
{code}

It causes the following exceptions with build 2.8.0.r16921-b2001734 running Java 1.6.0_03-p3 on Mac OS 10.4.11. The program works fine in Scala 2.7.1.

I think you need to synchronize on the {{Timer}} creation, to avoid a possible race where multiple {{Timer}} threads are created.

An alternative option might be to initialise the {{Timer}} as a daemon thread and just never cancel it. You can do this by using the Timer's other form of constructor.

This would mean the Timer thread lives forever, but that's already a possibility anyway. It will currently live forever if the {{Actor}} object is initialised, but the {{Scheduler}} is never started - admittedly an unusual situation!
I've been worrying about my suggestion to run {{Timer}} as a daemon thread. I think the test case below shows that it is not the right solution. The TIMEOUT message is never received, presumably because the {{Timer}} exits when the main thread exits, even though the {{Timer}} still needs to send a message.

{code}
import scala.actors.Actor._
import scala.actors.TIMEOUT

println("main-1")
actor {
  println("actor-1")
  reactWithin(2000) {
    case TIMEOUT => println("actor-2")
  }
}
println("main-2")
{code}

Output:

Rich - Give this a try:
{code}
import scala.actors.Actor._
import scala.actors.TIMEOUT

object Test1 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("main-1")
    actor {
      println("actor-1")
      reactWithin(2000) {
	case TIMEOUT => println("actor-2")
      }
    }
    println("main-2")
  }
}

{code}
Then compile & run it (this is with 2.7.4):
{code}
$$ scalac Test1.scala
$$ scala -cp . Test1
main-1
main-2
actor-1
actor-2
{code}
I think the problem is that the script runner calls System.exit() when the script finishes, so it doesn't matter if there are still living threads.
