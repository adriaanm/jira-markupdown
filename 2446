(In r23958) A test case for recently fixed SI-4114.  Plus!

I had closed SI-2441 as a duplicate of that, but unfortunately SI-4114 did
not bring SI-2441 along with it.  Then I realized I'm a programmer, not a
helpless trac watcher.  As is often the case with thes things, fixing that
revealed a bug in the library.  Closes SI-2441 for real, review by odersky.
