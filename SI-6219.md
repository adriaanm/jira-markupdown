The attached file mime.scala causes scalac to crash, producing the output error.out.

This issue first appears in 2.10.0-M5, and appears to be related to the total length of the identifier text (not the number of identifiers).
This might be a duplicate of #6172 . To find that out, please try with 2.10.x snapshot, or some version after this patch was applied: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1040 
Jon, I had overlooked `mime.scala` . It compiles fine with both the latest 2.10.x and trunk snapshots, ie any upcoming post-M6 version of 2.10 will also compile fine. This ticket is a duplicate of #6172 .
