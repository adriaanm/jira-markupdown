OK, thanks for the video.

The error messages you're seeing in the error log view are unrelated to the Scala errors you're seeing later. The later can be safely ignored.

To deal with the former hopefully,

  Window => Preferences => JDT Weaving => Click to enable

then follow the instructions to restart Eclipse.
