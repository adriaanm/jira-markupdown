Notable things:

 - The top-level offenders scala.Cell, scala.CountedIterator and scala.NotDefinedError are finally gone.
 - Cleanup in the scala package object (Tuples), Product and Function.
 - The collection library is considerably cleaner.
 - scala.Math is gone, scala.MathCommon is consolidated into the scala.math package object.
 - Failing tests were adapted, all tests pass.


The case of methods of one class overriding deprecated methods of another class without @deprecated appeared three times:

1.: findIndexOf
Deprecated in SeqLike [0], overridden in SeqProxyLike [1], SeqForwarder [2] without @deprecated.
=> Removed

2.: +
Deprecated in BufferLike [3], overridden in SynchronizedBuffer [4] without @depecated.
=> Removed

3.: size_=
UIElement's size_= [5] is deprecated, but overridden in Window [6].
I'm not sure what's intended:
 - remove the method from Window, too
 - remove just the override modifier
=> Kept (after asking on #scala)
