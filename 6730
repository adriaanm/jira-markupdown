OK, I seem to have misunderstood what sid-spec.pdf means ...  It seems that the text intends to say that {{@specialized}} annotations will be paid attention to unless you use {{-no-specialization}}, not that parameters are automatically specialized (although arguably that *should* happen).

Also, I didn't know about how to get correct code markup, and the code for TestSpecialize got munged.

{code}
class TestSpecialize[@specialized T](foo: T) {
    def getFoo() = foo
}
{code}
