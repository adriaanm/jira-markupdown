With 2.8.0.RC3 -optimise, the compiler warns about "a bug in the optimizer" 

```scala
class A {
    def f(x : Boolean) : Thread = {
        g {
            x match {
                case false =>
                    B.h { }
            }
        }

    }

    private def g[T](block : => T) = error("")
}

object B {
    def h(block : => Unit) : Nothing = error("")
}
```
```scala
warning: Encountered open block in isSafeToInline: this indicates a bug in the optimizer!
  caller = A$$$$anonfun$$f$$1.apply, callee = A$$$$anonfun$$f$$1.apply
            x match {
              ^
one warning found
```
See also #3248.  I just added that message as a stopgap between "horrible crash generating infinite output" and "actually fixed".  It's going to take me a bit to get a handle on the optimizer.
