Say I have the following maven-modules:
{code}
1. origo-legacy -> has a dependency to mail-1.4.1
2. origo-frontend -> dependes on 1
{code}
1) has a dependency to mail-1.4.1 given by the following maven-declaration:
{code}
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.mail</groupId>
  <artifactId>mail</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.1</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
{code}
The problem is that with 2.8.0-RC3 I get the following error compiling 2) with maven:
{code}
[INFO] Compiling 76 source files to /home/andreak/dev/origo/frontend/target/classes at 1275054960890
[ERROR] error: error while loading MimeHelper, Missing dependency 'class javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage', required by /home/andreak/dev/origo/legacy/target/officenet_origo-legacy-1.8.4-SNAPSHOT.jar(no/officenet/uno/util/mail/MimeHelper.class)
{code}
This works fine with RC2 and below. Note that the dependency on javax.mail:mail is "provided"-scope, in Maven terms, but for some reason Scala needs this class and complains...

Any hints on what's going on? I can "solve" this by including the dependency for javax.mail:mail as "provided" in all my maven-modules, but that should not be necessary, and was not necessary until RC3 came along...

If desirable I can provide a small maven-project which showcases the issue, which works in RC2.
