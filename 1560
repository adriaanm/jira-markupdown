I'm calling wontfix since it seems to be of limited scope.
I suspect people experimenting in the repl would either chose a different name or put the one-who-shall-not-be-referenced-without-prefix in a prefix that can be written down:

{code}
scala> object foo { object ~ }
defined module foo

scala> foo.~
res4: foo.~.type = foo$$tilde$@560e018a
{code}

Community, feel free to reopen (preferable with a pull request in hand).
