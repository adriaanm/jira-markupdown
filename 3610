Martin, reassigning to you as this one is beyond me.

typedThis does not allow trees like This(scala) but they are generated in TreeGen by calls from `addImport`, which calls `mkAttributedStableRef(pkg)`, as well as other code-paths that start in Implicits

this only comes up in this case because the Tree's symbol is set by
{code}
def mkAttributedThis(sym: Symbol): Tree =
    This(sym.name) setSymbol sym setType sym.thisType
}}

so `typedThis` doesn't actually type check those (qualifiyingClass has a shortcut in case the tree's symbol is already set), but `resetAllAttrs`, which is called in the adapt case I mentioned in an earlier comment, resets the type for these trees so that now they will have to be type checked

should typedThis be made more resilient? should these `This(pkg)` trees never be generated in the first place? ([http://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commit/4d2432b48caaa41217fb46f11b6f90663ac146c7 I tried that], but a locker that does that fails in quick.lib in mysterious ways that probably have something to do with stepping on the toes of bootstrapping and Predef)
