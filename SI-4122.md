```scala
val sw: Seq[Char] = "ab"
assert(sw == Seq('a', 'b'))  // FAILS
```

Seq-s should be equal when they contain the same elements in the same oder, and a WrappedString is a Seq, so the above should succeed.

Config: Scala 2.8.1.final, Java 1.6.0_22, Windows 7 64 bit

Note: The above with `val sw: Seq[Char] = Array('a', 'b')` works, so `WrappedArray` has no similar problem.
(In r23853) Removed Proxy from parents of WrappedString.  I guess it was there to
forward toString, but forwarding equals and hashCode breaks equality
with sequences.  Closes #4122, no review.
