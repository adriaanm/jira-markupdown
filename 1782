Interesting, but note that I am using plugin 2.8.0, and you are asking me to test against 2.7.4.

The problems that 2.7.4 generates, I do not see reported by the 2.8.0 plugin, anywhere in the list.

I did see them with past versions of the plugin, but that is one reason that I changed to the nightlies, to get away from that particular error (which seemed to cause more pervasive problems when attempting to run and/or refactor within Eclipse).

I recall that I was once-upon-a-time able to use the plugin versions of compiler and library to build our system, and did not see the errors there (so I recall); however, when I attempted to test this again, both with the current nightly plugin, and with a recent version of scala 2.8.0, ant failed quickly, like so:
{code}
BUILD FAILED
/Users/dr2chase/workspace/PFC/ProjectFortress/build.xml:192: The following error occurred while executing this line:
jar:file:/Users/dr2chase/workspace/PFC/ProjectFortress/third_party/scala/scala-compiler-2.8.0.jar!/scala/tools/ant/antlib.xml:5: taskdef A class needed by class scala.tools.ant.FastScalac cannot be found: scala/ScalaObject
{code}

I would like to again test a command line compilation against the 2.8.0 version of Scalac and library, so that I may do an actual apples-to-apples comparison of plugin and compiler.  I would not want to waste the time of the compiler team having them fix a bug that does not matter to me.

Do you have any advice for how to run the 2.8.0 scalac as an ant task?

I am using these lines to do it so far, and that produces the error above:
{code}
  <property name="scala-compiler.jar"
            value="${basedir}/third_party/scala/scala-compiler-2.8.0.jar"/>
  <property name="scala-library.jar"
            value="${basedir}/third_party/scala/scala.library-2.8.0.jar"/>
{code}

And ant version
