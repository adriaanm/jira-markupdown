When using REPL and editing multi-bytes characters, cursor does not move correctly and display of characters are broken. 
So it is very difficult to edit the line contains multi-bytes characters at REPL.

I guess that the following jline2 issue causes this issue.

If I replaced jline2 library from jline-2.12.1.jar to jline-2.14.1.jar in scala 2.11.7, the issue resolved.
I hope using newer jline2 for REPL.
