Current implementation of mutable.LinkedHashSet uses a ListBuffer as a companion of a standard HashSet. Consequently, a call to remove() actually calls both HashSet and ListBuffer's remove() methods, ListBuffer's being in O(n ).

An full O(1) implementation is expected and doable (for example, by storing double-linked cells in the HashSet, but something even better might exists).

I have not checked yet whether the immutable version is also affected.
the same as #5767
