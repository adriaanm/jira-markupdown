`java -verify` on the interfaces `C` and `MyCalendarTrait` results in `VerifyError` for the former but not the latter.  

Both contain members that would override a final method: 

{code}
// interface C 
{
public abstract void wait();
}


// interface MyCalendarTrait
{
public abstract java.util.Date getGregorianChange();
}
{code}

but only `C` causes a `VerifyError` (thus the example is even shorter, no need to  `new C {}`, it's enough `java -verify C`)
