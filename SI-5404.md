Sometimes it's necessary to pass parameters to macros untyped (e.g. if a parameter is a closure that refers to variables that are introduced by a macro). However, current implementation doesn't support this notion - all params are typechecked before the macro is expanded.
Another use-case for this is a compile-time test that a given expression should *not* compile. Eg. suppose we have a type class Foo[T] which should not have instances for String, then it would be highly desirable to be able to write a test of the form,

```scala
shouldNotCompile(implicitly[Foo[String]])
```

which typechecks *iff* implicitly[Foo[String]] does not typecheck.
