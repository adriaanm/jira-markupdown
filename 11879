Simpler example to discuss:
```scala
scala> Some("").flatMap(_ => null)
res19: Option[Nothing] = null
```

Here's the implementation of `flatMap`
```scala
  /** Returns the result of applying $f to this $option's value if this Option is nonempty...*/
  final def flatMap[B](f: A => Option[B]): Option[B] =
    if (isEmpty) None else f(this.get)
```

So the operation is working as documented, and I would not classify this as a bug.
