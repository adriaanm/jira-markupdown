Hi

I can't reproduce the problem, scalac-net and scala-net work for me (Also OS X Leopard, Mono 1.9) Three points:

1) I had to replace the {{mscorlib.dll}} that comes with the scala package with the one of the installed Mono version:

{code}
$$> ~/scala/dist/lib/mscorlib.dll ~/scala/dist/lib/mscorlib.dll.old
$$> cp /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Home/lib/mono/1.0/mscorlib.dll ~/scala/dist/lib/
{code}

2) There's a special character in the String of your example, namely the {{â€™}} in {{you've}}. Maybe its a problem of source file encoding?

3) In the example you give, you're using {{scalac-net}} to run the code, which is wrong. You should use {{scala-net}} (without the "c"). Is this only a typo in the description on trac?

Cheers: Lukas
