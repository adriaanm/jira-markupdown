These show that the compiler knows that a wildcard is not a valid identifier in accordance with the spec:
```scala
scala> def _ = 3
<console>:1: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
       def _ = 3
           ^

scala> class _
<console>:1: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
       class _
             ^

scala> val _ = 3
<console>:5: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
  lazy val $result = _
                                          ^
<console>:10: error: identifier expected but '_' found.
 + "_: Int = " + scala.runtime.ScalaRunTime.replStringOf(_, 1000)
                                                                              ^
```

However, scalac complains about multiple bindings to _ :
```scala
scala> { val _ = 3; val _ = 5; 7 }
<console>:8: error: _ is already defined as value _
              { val _ = 3; val _ = 5; 7 }
                               ^
```

This was reported on a mailing list a while ago (http://www.scala-lang.org/node/7159), but never filed as an issue.  One improvement since then:
```scala
scala> { val _ = 3; `_` }
<console>:1: error: wildcard invalid as backquoted identifier
       { val _ = 3; `_` }
                    ^
```
