Java class
```scala
 package aaa;

 public abstract class MyJavaClass {
     abstract protected int foo();
 }
```

Scala class
```scala
 package ccc

 import aaa.MyJavaClass

 class MyScalaClass extends MyJavaClass {
     protected def foo: Int = 42
 }
```

 We cannot compile them together cause and get a compilation error
 "Error:Error:line (6)error: error overriding method foo in class MyJavaClass
 of type ()scala.this.Int;
 method foo has weaker access privileges; it should be at least
 protected[aaa]
 protected def foo: Int = 42"

But if MyJavaClass is already compiled and added to appropriate classpath we can compile our MyScalaClass without any problems.
