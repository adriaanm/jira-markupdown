Thanks for spending the time to isolate this. Even if you now have a fix, a missing classpath entry shouldn't have crashed the compiler. If you're able to reproduce the simplest variant outside of Eclipse just using the command line tools, it'd be extremely helpful if you could create a new ticket with the component set to "Compiler".

Also, ask on scala-tools@ for advice about running JUnit tests.
