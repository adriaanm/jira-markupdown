And from the sounds of the comment, SI-1434
See a similar mis-use of {{existentialAbstraction}} here: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3519
Avoiding regressing into a warning for:

{code}
final case class T2[+A, +B](a: A, b: B)

class A {
  def f3 = T2(1, 2) match {
    case _: T2[_, Int] => /* nowarn */
    case _             =>
  }
}

{code}

Represents the Pepsi challenge for this bug.
