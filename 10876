Since {{newBuilder}} is protected, it's not straightforward to add an appropriate test to collections-laws.  And this is weird indeed since {{Traversable}} does the right thing while {{collection.Set}} does not.  So to properly test you need appropriate downcasting abstractions and then to try every downcast.
