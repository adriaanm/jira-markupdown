According to section 6.15 of the spec, `f(x) = e` is valid syntactic sugar for `f.update(x, e)` even when `f(x)` is not valid (i.e. there is no `apply` method present).

However, `f.x = e` is valid syntactic sugar for `f.x_=(e)` *only* when `f.x` is also valid (i.e. there is a parameterless method named `x` present in `f`). This seems inconsistent.

Hence, I suggest allowing "write-only" fields with a setter but no getter so that `f.x = e` is *always* shorthand for `f.x_=(e)` even when there is no `x` method present.
Oops, just noticed that this is a duplicate of #915, which was closed as big enough to deserve a SIP. Sorry.
