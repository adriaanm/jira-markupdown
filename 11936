TypeTag is a class in the Scala standard library, it implements equals and hashCode. Why cannot these implementations be changed to have the same semantics as =:=? Something like this:

{code}
  trait TypeTag[T] extends WeakTypeTag[T] with Equals with Serializable {
    override def equals(x: Any) = x.isInstanceOf[TypeTag[_]] &&  this.tpe =:= x.asInstanceOf[TypeTag[_]].tpe
  }
{code}
