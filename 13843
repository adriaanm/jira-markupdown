I've dumped a bunch of tests in pending. They are:
```scala
pending/jvm5/t1464
pending/pos5/ilya2
pending/pos5/misc
```

These all fail for one or another reason when I try to run them via partest. misc and ilya2 seem to result in scalac trying to compile Java files thinking they're Scala ones. t1464 doesn't pick up the compiled Test file when partest tries to run it.
