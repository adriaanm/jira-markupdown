On every compile of Scala, we get this warning:
```scala
[artifact:dependencies] [WARNING] POM for 'biz.aQute:bndlib:pom:1.43.0:compile' is invalid.
[artifact:dependencies] 
[artifact:dependencies] Its dependencies (if any) will NOT be available to the current build.
```

This is caused an invalid format of the POM file for bndlib.

We should get rid of it, because pointless noise in builds tends to take away attention when real warnings show up.
