(extempore in [r25455|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25455]) Fixed bug in the disambiguation of f(foo='bar') style method calls in
the presence of overloading, parameterization, and by-name arguments.
Took the opportunity to clean things up a little bit. Closes SI-4592,
review by rytz.
