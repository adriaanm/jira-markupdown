Currently, the class scala.util.parsing.input.Reader 
defines the method
{code}
def source  : java.lang.CharSequence
{code}
_If this is a reader over character sequences, the underlying char sequence If not, throws a !NoSuchMethodError exception._

This feels very un-Scala-like. I suggest changing this to return Option[!CharSequence], or deprecating this
method and adding a replacement:

{code}
def charSequence : Option[java.lang.CharSequence]
{code}

_If this is a reader over character sequences, return Some[charSequence], else return None_

(Side note: there is a missing period in the doc string.)
