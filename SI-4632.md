I think the moving of Predef.error to sys.error is clearly a bad decision. The deprecation warning should be removed in the next version.

- `error` does not have to do anything with the system, like `exit` (exit the virtual machine) or `props` (get system properties) or `env` (environment variables)
- `error` has control flow meaning and should be readily accessible like other control flow statements (`return`, `if`, `throw`)
- `error` goes in the same logical namespace as `require` and `assert`
- i have just converted the build version of a dozen different projects from 2.8.1 to 2.9.0. the deprecation warning about `error`
  is virtually the only thing that happens in compiling under 2.9.0 which underlines that this change was inappropriate (`error` is
  used pervasively. not just in my projects, i have seen the same thing elsewhere, e.g. scalaz); for 43 file / 623 compiled classes
  project, i get like 24 warnings, all coming from `Predef.error`.

I think these are all good reasons for removing the deprecation again.
The decision seems to have come from this thread: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3762 -- and it doesn't sound like there was big a impulse behind this particular renaming...
