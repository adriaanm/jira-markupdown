Many [Use case] entries in the documentation of Range report Range as return type when it should be IndexedSeq (or Seq[...]).
Please give an example. An use case entry gives a simplified type signature that adequately explains *one* use case, not the general case. The full type signature is available elsewhere, and `IndexedSeq` or `Seq` are not correct for them.
I use scala 2.9.2:
```scala
# scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.9.2 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
```

In scala API doc at Range page there is an use case of union (http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/Range.html)
The use case says :
```scala
def union(that: Seq[Int]): Range[A] 
```

Then when I use union, Range union produces IndexedSeq.

```scala
scala> Range(1,5).union(Range(4,8))
res0: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7)

Range(1,5).union(Seq(4,3,2))
res1: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2)
```

The doc explains :
```scala
def union[B >: Int, That](that: GenSeq[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[IndexedSeq[Int], B, That]): That 
```
But it's more difficult to read and possibly not corroborating with the usecase.


Yes, the real type signature is more difficult to read, which is why there are use cases.

Anyway, I have looked into it, and verified that there's no CanBuildFrom that creates a Range. Furthermore, it seems `$Coll` (as opposed to `$coll`) is only used on use cases, so `IndexedSeq` would be better. Or, perhaps, just do not redefine it on `Range` (I'm not sure if it gets inherited from IndexedSeq or not).

It's a very small change, but one does have to build the docs to look them over, and I'm a bit out of time these days. Maybe someone will come and pick this up, but this sort of ticket is very low priority. If you had more experience with Scala, I'd advise to look into submitting a pull request for it yourself. And if you have enough git, github and ant experience, you should try it -- just remove the line where `$Coll` is defined on the source file for `Range`, plus do all the fork/branch/edit/test/push/pull request work. People on irc and mailing lists can help you with it.
