This bug has been popping up regularly during Scalaz development for a few months, but I could never reproduce it in isolation.

It can usually be worked around by adding or removing type ascriptions, extracting sub-expressions to local vals, as demonstrated below. 

{code}

trait Applicative[M[_]]

sealed trait MA[M[_], A] { 
  def sequence[N[_], B](implicit a: A <:< N[B], n: Applicative[N]): N[M[B]] = error("stub")
  
  def sequence2[N[_], B](implicit a: A <:< N[B]): N[M[B]] = error("stub")
}

object test {
  implicit def ListMA[A](l: List[A]): MA[List, A] = error("stub")  
  implicit val ao: Applicative[Option] = error("stub")


  /* All of these variations compile OK:
  {
    val x = List[Option[Int]]().sequence; 
    x: Option[List[Int]]
  }  
  {
    val x = ((List[Option[Int]]()): MA[List, Option[Int]]).sequence; 
    x: Option[List[Int]]
  }
  (null: MA[List, Option[Int]]).sequence: Option[List[Int]]
  (List[Option[Int]]()).sequence2: Option[List[Int]]
  (ListMA(List[Option[Int]]())).sequence: Option[List[Int]]
  {
      val ls: List[Option[Int]] = Nil
      ls.sequence: Option[List[Int]]
  }
  */
      
  //enclosing.scala:33: error: immutable is not an enclosing class
  (List[Option[Int]]()).sequence: Option[List[Int]]
}

{code}

Here are two more datapoints, one positive, one negative.

{code}
trait Applicative[M[_]]

sealed trait MA[M[_], A] {
  def sequence[N[_], B](implicit a: A <:< N[B], n: Applicative[N]): N[M[B]] = error("stub")

  def sequence3[N[_], B]()(implicit a: A <:< N[B], n: Applicative[N]): N[M[B]] = error("stub")
}

object test {
  implicit def ListMA[A](l: List[A]): MA[List, A] = error("stub")
  implicit val ao: Applicative[Option] = error("stub")

  /* This compiles OK:
  (Nil: List[Option[Int]]).sequence3(): Option[List[Int]]
  */

  // error: immutable is not an enclosing class
  // !!! No line number is reported with the error
  (Nil: List[Option[Int]]).sequence: Option[List[Int]]
}
{code}
The crux of the problem appears to be in `inferExpressionInstance` when called with these arguments:

{code}
tree = "test.this.ListMA[Option[Int]]((immutable.this.Nil: List[Option[Int]])).sequence[N, B]"
tparams = "List(type N, type B)"
pt = "Option[List[Int]]"
keepNothings = false
{code}

It gets to a point where:

{code}
detargs = "List(N, Int)"
detparams = "List(type B)"
{code}

Should there be an invariant that these lists are the same length?

This mutates tree to:

{code}
test.this.ListMA[Option[Int]]((immutable.this.Nil: List[Option[Int]])).sequence[N, N]
{code}

and returns:

{code}
undetparams$$3 = "List(type N)"
{code}
(In r21128) closes SI-3152: refactored adjustTypeArgs and methTypeArgs so that tparams are correctly split into ones that were inferred successfully, and that thus have a corresponding type argument, and those that weren't determined

I didn't investigate the exact cause of the final error message in the bug report, but Jason Zaugg's observations seems correct and I never liked that uninstantiated buffer in the first place.

review by odersky
(In r21129) slight (syntactic) cleanup of patch for see SI-3152 -- sorry, only realised when looking over my patch again
reopening because the "fix" caused SI-3477
the original patch addressed the mismatch between the list of type arguments (including dummy-Nothings) and the type params (where undetermined ones are dropped) by dropping both argument and parameter when they could not be determined (before, only the list of type parameters was pruned)

[the "dual" solution would be to stop dropping the parameter before doing the substitution (which implies undetermined parameters would get instantiated to themselves)]

undetermined type params are treated in two different ways:

1) they don't get instantiated: for undetermined type params, adjustTypeArgs returns the type that refers to the type parameter  so substitution is a no-op

NOTE: eventually they do get substituted --  but where?!

2) when checking the bounds, we should pretend undetermined type parameters have been instantiated to Nothing

SI-3477 is concerned with the second case, which would be an improvement we should probably include in 2.8.1

I came across this variant while porting some code to 2.8.  In RC3 and r22181:
{code}
scala> val a = Array(1,2,3)               
a: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)

scala> def x(a: Seq[Int]): Seq[Int] = a   
x: (a: Seq[Int])Seq[Int]

scala> x(a)                               
res0: Seq[Int] = WrappedArray(1, 2, 3)

scala> x(a.toArray)                    
<console>:8: error: scala is not an enclosing class
       x(a.toArray)
         ^
{code}
I can repro in one line. Who does better?

{code}
scala> Array(1).toArray : Seq[Int] 
<console>:6: error: scala is not an enclosing class
       Array(1).toArray : Seq[Int] 
{code}
Martin, reassigning to you as this one is beyond me.

typedThis does not allow trees like This(scala) but they are generated in TreeGen by calls from `addImport`, which calls `mkAttributedStableRef(pkg)`, as well as other code-paths that start in Implicits

this only comes up in this case because the Tree's symbol is set by
{code}
def mkAttributedThis(sym: Symbol): Tree =
    This(sym.name) setSymbol sym setType sym.thisType
}}

so `typedThis` doesn't actually type check those (qualifiyingClass has a shortcut in case the tree's symbol is already set), but `resetAllAttrs`, which is called in the adapt case I mentioned in an earlier comment, resets the type for these trees so that now they will have to be type checked

should typedThis be made more resilient? should these `This(pkg)` trees never be generated in the first place? ([http://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commit/4d2432b48caaa41217fb46f11b6f90663ac146c7 I tried that], but a locker that does that fails in quick.lib in mysterious ways that probably have something to do with stepping on the toes of bootstrapping and Predef)


[urgh -- why can't I edit my comments... here's the text that shouldn't have gone in that code block]

(In r22523) cleaned up the mess that resulted from cobbling together fixes for see SI-3477 and see SI-3152
adjustTypeArgs and methTypeArgs now return a LinkedHashMap[Symbol, Option[Type]]
TODO: check that type inference is still just as lightning fast as before
and another repro:

{code}

scala> def compare[T](x: Ordered[T], y: Ordered[T]) = error("")
compare: [T](x: Ordered[T],y: Ordered[T])Nothing

scala> def mkEx: Ordered[_] = error("")                        
mkEx: Ordered[_]

scala> compare(mkEx, mkEx)                                     
<console>:8: error: math is not an enclosing class
       compare(mkEx, mkEx)
               ^
<console>:8: error: math is not an enclosing class
       compare(mkEx, mkEx)

{code}
Here's something weird. (Preface: apparently the addition of implicit def SeqDerived to Ordering means that adriaan's recent repro is now a diverging implicit expansion.  Is that indicative of a bigger problem? Should we maybe pull that? So one has to get rid of that to see this.)

Why does ordered fail with the "enclosing class" error but Ordering completely differently?
{code}
object Weird {
  def compare[T](x: Ordered[T], y: Ordered[T]) = error("")
  def mkEx: Ordered[_] = error("")
  compare(mkEx, mkEx)
  
  def compare2[T](x: Ordering[T], y: Ordering[T]) = error("")
  def mkEx2: Ordering[_] = error("")
  compare2(mkEx2, mkEx2)
}
{code}
