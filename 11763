More concretely, in:

{code}
class C1; class C2
trait T1 extends C1
trait T2 extends C2
class C3 extends T1 with T2
{code}

There is no way to let Java know that C3 extends both C1 and C2. AFAICT, we used to pick one of them and pretend that we extend it directly, which is what happened before the change to SI-8931. But we can't tell the full story.
