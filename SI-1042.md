`Array[AnyRef]` definition cannot be used to override a Java interface method containing a vararg parameter. See the brief example below:

`Foo.java` definition:
```scala
package foo;

public interface Foo {
  void exec(String name, Object...objects);
}
```

Then write the following scala source in Eclipse `FooApp.scala`

```scala
package client
import foo.Foo

object FooApp extends Application {
  val foo = new Foo {
    override def exec(name:java.lang.String, objects:Array[AnyRef]) {
      printf("exec")
    }
  }
}
```

The above code raises two errors in the Problems view, as follows:
"method exec overrides nothing" and 
"object creation impossible, since method exec in trait Foo of type 
(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object*)Unit is not defined."

However, the code compiles perfectly when using the plain `scalac` command-line compiler. 

I'm using the beta plugin 2.7.1.r15152-b20080522020257. 
You should use:
```scala
override def exec(name:java.lang.String, objects: AnyRef*)
```
Oh, I see. I was testing my code with the scalac (2.7.1-final) compiler and it does not accept the workaround, which was the confusing thing here. Now I realise that this is due to some change in `scalac` that is not yet present in the eclipse plugin.  

```scala
client\FooApp.scala:5: error: object creation impossible, since method exec in t
rait Foo of type (java.lang.String,Array[java.lang.Object])Unit is not defined
  val foo = new Foo {
            ^
client\FooApp.scala:6: error: method exec overrides nothing
    override def exec(name:java.lang.String, objects:AnyRef*) {
                 ^
two errors found

```
