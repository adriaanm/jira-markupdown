implicit def block2Runnable(block: =>Unit): Runnable = new Runnable {
  override def run = { println("here"); block }
}

val runnable: Runnable = { println("there"); () }

A valid expectation is that here gets printed before there, whereas the reverse is what actually happens, because the implicit conversion gets applied to the (), not to the whole block.

I'd suggest making it a conversion from () => Unit to Runnable instead, and attach a patch that does so.

I also altered onEDT and onEDTWait to use Runnable directly, as there isn't much advantage in going via the implicit conversion in those cases.
