The code for ++= in ArrayBuffer.scala is currently this:

{{
  override def ++=(xs: TraversableOnce[A]): this.type = xs match {
    case v: IndexedSeq[_] =>
      val n = v.length
      ensureSize(size0 + n)
      v.copyToArray(array.asInstanceOf[scala.Array[Any]], size0, n)
      size0 += n
      this
    case _ =>
      super.++=(xs)
  }

}}

However, the "case v: IndexedSeq[_]" only matches mutable IndexedSeq, whereas this optimization would also be valid for structures like the immutable Vector.
(extempore in [r25509|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25509]) A conceivably pretty bad performance bug in builders.

SI-4821 pointed out that ArrayBuffer's ++ checks for a cheap size
method by matching on IndexedSeq, but mutable.IndexedSeq, so all
immutable collections are thrown in the same group as linear seqs.
I went looking for other examples of this and found them, in
key classes like Builder.

The "type shadowing trap" is a serious issue in the collections.
Closes SI-4821, no review.
