Steps to reproduce:

(1) Create two files:

src/test/BarFile.scala
{code}
package test

import test2.BarFile

object Bar {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    
  }
}
{code}

src/test2/BarFile.scala
{code}
package test2

class BarFile {

}
{code}

(2) Do clean build

(3) Notice error in problems view "Bar is already defined as object Bar". Also, no classfiles are compiled.

(4) Edit and save test/BarFile.scala

(5) Notice that classfiles are generated and the problems view shows no errors

Of course, in my environment the second BarFile was not in the same project (it was in a jar). Strangely, renaming test/BarFile.scala to test/Bar.scala fixes the problem.
