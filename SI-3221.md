When we rename or delete a top level symbol no errors appear in the Problems View.

*Step to reproduce*

In a Scala project:
 1. Create a class A in a file named A.scala
 2. Create a class B in a file named B.scala that references class A
{code}
class B {
  val a: A = null
}
{code}
 3. Open the file A.scala, comment out the definition of class A and save the file.

After the above three steps we expect to see an error in the Problems View but nothing appears.

If we open the editor for B.scala then we see the expected error in the editor, but the error still does not appear in the Problems View. If we do a clean with an automatic build then the error appears in the Problems View as expected.

Tested with r21230.
