=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Try to compile the following code (scalac or scala interpreter):
```scala
  val test = Map("test" -> ("a", "b".foo))
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The error message should be the same as for:
```scala
  val test = Map("test" -> "b".foo)
```
Namely:
```scala
error: value foo is not a member of java.lang.String
       val test = Map("test" -> "b".foo)
                                    ^
```

=== What do you see instead? ===
The following error is returned:
```scala
error: too many arguments for method ->: (y: B)(java.lang.String, B)
       val test = Map("test" -> ("a", "b".foo)) 
                             ^
```

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: javac 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.10
It isn't a map literal, it's a method call.  This is just how things are.  If you don't want parentheses to sometimes be misinterpreted, then write tuples one of these ways.
```scala
val test = Map("test" -> (("a", "b".foo)))
val test = Map("test" -> ("a" -> "b".foo))
```
