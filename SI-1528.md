I downloaded the 'scala' project from SVN into Eclipse

When I open the source src/library/scala/Enumeration.scala
there is an exception in the Error log with the message

error in presentation normal compile  opening scala file

scala.tools.nsc.FatalError: object scala.Predef not found.

The editor opens on the source, but the Outline is empty.
Also, there is an empty panel above the source and below the tabs.
If I click in that panel, I get an event error

A handler conflict occurred.  This may disable some commands.

An exception stack trace is not available.

I get more errors when I click elsewhere in the source, etc.

This project is configured such that src/library is not
one of the project source folders, so this is a unparented
scala source file.

Full traceback is in the attachment

I followed https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/EclipsePlugin :
I installed the 2.7.2-final scala plugin (not the nightly) for Eclipse 
and restarted Eclipse (3.4.1 J2EE Ganymede release).

I downloaded the trunk versions of scala, scala-library, and scala-plugin 
via Subclipse. This gave me three Scala projects. The scala project has a .classpath

{{<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src/compiler"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/msil.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/jline.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.pde.core.requiredPlugins"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/fjbg.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="bin"/>
</classpath>

{code}

Thus, the "src/library" directory is not a Source folder in my Java Build Path
for this project; it's "just another file". By "unparented", I mean it
is not in a project source directory.

All three projects have been build successfully; I can launch
the plugin PDE project, etc. However, I'm was not using this PDE project
when I got the error; i.e. this was not from a PDE Launch configuration
in scala-plugin; this error was with the 2.7.2-final plugin.

From here, all I did was navigate in the Package Explorer
to <scala>/src/library/scala/Enumeration.scala and opened
the file. I'll try to attach another screenshot showing the
Eclipse windows including the Package Explorere, Error Log,
and Enumeration.scala Scala editor; Trac does not offer
that on this 'add comment' action.

Thanks for the screenshot. Unfortunately I'm not able to reproduce this ... for me Enumeration.scala opens without error. Is it something that happens for you with all the Scala library sources or just Enumeration.scala?
