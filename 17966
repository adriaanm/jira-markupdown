This comes up a lot:
```scala
But if I directly append the sortBy()-call, like this:
val x = List(1,2).toSet.toList.sortBy(x => -x)

Then I'm getting the following error:
error: diverging implicit expansion for type scala.math.Ordering[B]
starting with method Tuple9 in object Ordering
              List(1,2).toSet.toList.sortBy(x => -x)
                                           ^
```

Perhaps we could show the inferred type arguments of the prefix of the expression when we hit this error, and the sought type includes a type variable under inference.

Not sure how far we can get without a fully blown type debugger, but we can surely avoid spewing out the diverging implicits error without some elaboration.
