=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
Launch the Scala REPL.  To see what's happening use the `-verbose` option
```scala
  scala -verbose
```

=== Past behaviour ===

Under Scala 2.8.x the "Welcome to Scala..." message was displayed before the classloading resulting in fairly responsive feedback after the user has issued the `scala` command.

=== Present behaviour ===

Under Scala 2.9.0.RC4 the "Welcome to Scala..." message is delayed until after all the classloading has completed which leaves the user waiting approx. 2 seconds before there is any sign that anything is happening.  The overall impression is that the launch is doing nothing or is slower than 2.8.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC4 (and latest nightly)
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6 / 7
(extempore in [r25045](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25045)) Working on the finer points of the Total Repl Experience.  Some of
what is in this patch:

 - Instantaneous repl startup.  Closes #4561.
 - SIGINT handler installed last.  If you've been annoyed at the repl
being difficult to interrupt during its initialization, this one is
especially for you.
 - Started abstracting out some bits which would go into an API and
reconfiguring the repl in those terms.

For a good time, call S-C-A-L-A -Dscala.repl.power.  No review.
