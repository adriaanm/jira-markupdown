The following Java source fails to compile:

import scala.None;

yielding the following error from javac (1.6.0_10 beta):

cannot access scala.None
bad class file: scala/None.class(scala:None.class)
undeclared type variable: A
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
import scala.None;
            ^

I am compiling against the scala-library.jar from Scala 2.7.2-final.

This looks related to SI-1454
You didn't read what he wrote he said "The following *JAVA* source file".
I superficially understand this bug and have implemented a workaround; however the workaround should probably be considered too ghastly to use.  Clearly it would be better to fix the underlying issue, which I believe is the inconsistent treatment of Nothing as I partially described in comments in SI-1572.

When type parameters are used in certain positions, and then an object is parameterized on Nothing (as scala.None is) then in those positions the type parameter remains in the method signature, causing the bad class file.  To work around this I added bridges to None which explicitly state the type parameter and then call the same method in Option.
{code}
  override def foreach(f: Nothing => Unit) = super.foreach(f)
  override def toLeft[X](right: => X) = super.toLeft(right)
  override def toRight[X](left: => X) = super.toRight(left)
  override def toList: List[Nothing] = super.toList
  override def elements: Iterator[Nothing] = super.elements
  override def map[B](f: Nothing => B): Option[B] = super.map(f)
  override def flatMap[B](f: Nothing => Option[B]): Option[B] = super.flatMap(f)
  override def filter(p: Nothing => Boolean): Option[Nothing] = super.filter(p)  
{code}
Once this is done it can be used from java.

Here is an example method signature (filter) before and after these changes:
{code}
const SI-67 = Asciz	(Lscala/Function1<TA;Ljava/lang/Boolean;>;)Lscala/Option<TA;>;;
const SI-29 = Asciz	(Lscala/Function1<Lscala/Nothing;Ljava/lang/Boolean;>;)Lscala/Option<Lscala/Nothing;>;;
{code}
Notice however that after these changes scala/Nothing is in the bytecode, which as I understand it is supposed to be represented as scala.runtime.Nothing$$, and having that non-existent class referenced in classfiles causes at least the trouble described in SI-1572.
