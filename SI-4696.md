please add the following to (maybe) PreDef:
```scala
  def classer[T](v: T): Class[T] =
    v.asInstanceOf[AnyRef].getClass.asInstanceOf[Class[T]]
```
Using the Java Object getClass method which returns a Class[_] is so Java.
Please, I want something that returns Class[type-of-object].
Thanks
Sorry, I should have added that it sounds like we could just pull the rug from under the old getClass's feet and replace calls to it by calls to our runtimeClass, which is like a getClass2.0, and which could thus be called thusly (without the version number). It only adds new behaviour (for AnyVal) and better typing right?
If Scala was already matching the Java behavior, and we wanted to do better, then maybe a new name would be needed. But currently getClass in Scala sucks compared to getClass in Java. If all we want is to bring lame Scala up to awesome Java's level, then it should be fine to just call it getClass, yes?

In Java 6 "The actual result type is Class<? extends |X|> where |X| is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which getClass is called." See #490.
(extempore in [r25137](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25137)) A total rewrite of "runtimeClass", discarding the user-space
approach in favor of simply fixing getClass.

  def f1 = 5.getClass                       // Class[Int]
  def f2 = (5: AnyVal).getClass             // Class[_ <: AnyVal]
  def f3 = (5: java.lang.Integer).getClass  // Class[_ <: java.lang.Integer]

  class A
  class B extends A

  def f1 = (new B: Any).getClass().newInstance()      // Any
  def f2 = (new B: AnyRef).getClass().newInstance()   // AnyRef
  def f3 = (new B: A).getClass().newInstance()        // A
  def f4 = (new B: B).getClass().newInstance()        // B

But that's not all!

  def f0[T >: B] = (new B: T).getClass().newInstance()

  def f5 = f0[Any]        // Any
  def f6 = f0[AnyRef]     // AnyRef
  def f7 = f0[A]          // A
  def f8 = f0[B]          // B

Closes #490, #896, #4696.  Review by moors.  (Note: I think this is
pretty good, but picky review requested.)
