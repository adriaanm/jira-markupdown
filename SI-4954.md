LinkedHashMap.keys returns the keys of the map in insertion order, but if that collection is manipulated in any way, it reverts to an unordered Set.

This is somewhat surprising, particularly as keys is Iterable.

Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.1 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0-internal).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val m = scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3, "four" -> 4, "five" -> 5)
m: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap[java.lang.String,Int] = Map(one -> 1, two -> 2, three -> 3, four -> 4, five -> 5)

scala> m.keys
res0: Iterable[java.lang.String] = Set(one, two, three, four, five)

scala> m.keys.drop(0)
res1: Iterable[java.lang.String] = Set(four, three, two, five, one)
{code}
You are being fooled by a (fixed since 2.9.0-1) bug in the repl.  If you compile and run this, they are in order.
{code}
object Test {
  val m = scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap("one" -> 1, "two" -> 2, "three" -> 3, "four" -> 4, "five" -> 5)
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    m.keys foreach println
    m.keys drop 1 foreach println
  }
}
{code}
The repl has its own logic for printing traversables so Arrays don't get printed as mr. squiggly.
I'm going with this:
{noformat}
scala> scala.collection.mutable.LinkedHashMap().isInstanceOf[scala.collection.generic.Sorted[_, _]]
res0: Boolean = false
{noformat}
Without that, nothing is going to return the same type, i.e. "Sorted".
Here's another thing which seems less than ideal.  I wish I could even find documentation as to what is expected here.  If it's intentional that "keySet" stays sorted while "keys" throws it out the window, that should not be difficult information to come by.

{code}
scala> scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap(1 to 100 zip (1 to 100) : _*).keys
res0: Iterable[Int] = Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100)

scala> res0.getClass
res1: java.lang.Class[_ <: Iterable[Int]] = class scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap$DefaultKeySortedSet

scala> scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap(1 to 100 zip (1 to 100) : _*).keys ++ Set()
res2: Iterable[Int] = Set(69, 88, 5, 10, 56, 42, 24, 37, 25, 52, 14, 20, 46, 93, 57, 78, 29, 84, 61, 89, 1, 74, 6, 60, 85, 28, 38, 70, 21, 33, 92, 65, 97, 9, 53, 77, 96, 13, 41, 73, 2, 32, 34, 45, 64, 17, 22, 44, 59, 27, 71, 12, 54, 49, 86, 81, 76, 7, 39, 98, 91, 66, 3, 80, 35, 48, 63, 18, 95, 50, 67, 16, 31, 11, 72, 43, 99, 87, 40, 26, 55, 23, 8, 75, 58, 82, 36, 30, 51, 19, 4, 79, 94, 47, 15, 68, 62, 90, 83, 100)

Going to pursue a minimal fix for linkedhashmap; we don't want to try to support orderedness in the type system, and linkedhashmap is performance sensitive so shoehorning things so it can use Sorted's machinery to retain ordering is a bust.
