Hi Christoph

I've updated the code with your test, much better, thanks 

On containsItem,  I think that if the item has been removed from 'listeners' then it should not be called, sounds like another bug waiting to happen. I then couldn't determine how long purgeReferences would take and guessed that in this case it wasn't needed so didn't want to call it.  As for the name then I also could'nt come up with a good one :-).  I did try making it protected  but that prevented it being seen by publish(), the whole class is package[swing] protected so at least it's limiting who can use it.  Happy to take suggestions of both name and visibility
