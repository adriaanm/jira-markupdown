@retronym's workaround is good for the match forms in scala/bug#1089 and scala/bug#1673 too, ie. the following compiles and evaluates as expected,
```scala
scala> val l = List(1, "foo", null)
l: List[Any] = List(1, foo, null)

scala> for (s @ (_x : String) <- l) yield s
res0: List[String] = List(foo)
```
