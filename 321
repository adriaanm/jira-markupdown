I agree, I'd rather see the Scala compiler developers spending time on core language features, e.g. more optimizations, that we would use all the time then a compiler warning, or a compiler platform.

The issue I had with closing the ticket was the "Out of Scope" resolution, which doesn't seem accurate, as a compiler is one place to check for programming errors.  What about adding another "Will not implement" and provide the limited resources as a reason in the comment?  I wouldn't have been so adamant about this issue then :)
