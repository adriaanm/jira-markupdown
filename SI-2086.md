Well, beeing a casual user it would be helpful if the "noninvasive augmenting classes" like e.g. RichInt would be documented directly at the "augmented classes" like e.g. Int.
I countinuously scroll in API "is there an RichXxx and does it add what I am looking for"

My apologies if this has been discussed earlier. It's my 1st try of a request.
