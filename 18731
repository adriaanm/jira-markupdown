if a parameter to a constructor has the same name as the field of a parent class, that fields getter doesn't show up in calls to `Type.members`:
```scala
import scala.reflect.runtime.{universe => ru}
class A(var x: Int)
class B(x:Int, var y: Int) extends A(x)
scala> ru.typeOf[B].members.filter{_.name.toString.contains("x")}
res23: Iterable[reflect.runtime.universe.Symbol] = SynchronizedOps(value x, method x_=)
```

(notice that "method x", the getter, is missing.)

This only seems to be happening because the constructor for B has a parameter named "x" also.  Normally, `members` does return inherited getters.
