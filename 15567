```scala
> scalac foo
```
gives:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException: source file 'foo' could not be found
	at scala.tools.nsc.Global.getSourceFile(Global.scala:234)
...
```
It should say instead "Don't know what to do with foo".
```scala
> scalac foo.scala
```
gives the same stack trace. It should say "not found: foo.scala" instead.

These things used to work. Not sure when they stopped doing that.
