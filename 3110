I'm guessing this isn't going to be applied to any 2.7 version at this point.  I modified the test case for 2.8 (and it passes for r22171).  The main part is just changing the imports to:
{code}
import java.util.LinkedList
import collection.JavaConversions._
{code}
and checking against a Seq instead of !LinkedList.  It isn't semantically identical, but it might still be useful.  Updated version attached.
