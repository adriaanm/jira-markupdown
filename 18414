scala.bat does not double quote the %COMSPEC% path variable when setting the exit code ([last line of the script|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/templates/tool-windows.tmpl#L92]):

{code}
@@%COMSPEC% /C exit %errorlevel% >nul
{code}

Instead of:

{code}
@@"%COMSPEC%" /C exit %errorlevel% >nul
{code}

This is usually ok because cmd.exe is in system32 by default (that path has no space in it), but it can be elsewhere in some configs and it creates a useless error message when the user is closing the REPL, like {{'Unknown command "C:\Program"'}}
