I also would have leapt to the conclusion it's a pattern matcher bug, but this is dying in the typer.  In Variances, def varianceInType has no case for BoundedWildcardType, which is arriving there when C2's case accessor type is inferred.  Since it's assigned to me I'd fix it anyway if I knew the right thing...
```scala
    // something like this maybe?
    case BoundedWildcardType(bounds) =>
      varianceInType(bounds)(tparam)
```
So instead of fixing this, I'll open another related ticket I found while looking at it.
