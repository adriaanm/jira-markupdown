Similar to SI-5097, this diff makes use of AbstractFunction<N> in the cases where this isn't done explicitly by the compiler (because of explicit concrete inheritance from (... => ...) or Function<N>). Shaves a couple dozen kiB off of the library.
I agree some automatic optimization would be best. There is one major complication though. We need to ensure that the same linearization behavior holds. That condition alone probably means we can optimize only final classes that inherit from (=>) because we cannot very well reason about linearizations of subclasses
