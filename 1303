I'm using Eclipse 3.4.1 with the nightly build of the Scala plugin on Fedora 10 (although I don't use the Eclipse packaged with Fedora). I can reproduce it on Windows Vista, too (same version).
Here's the console output of eclipse when building:
When doing clean build:
```scala
build ColoredCost.scala
build Cost.scala
build Colored.scala
build Color.scala
build Characteristics.scala
```

After changing Characteristics.scala:
```scala
build Characteristics.scala
late /home/Florian/workspace/Bug/src/core/colored/ColoredCost.scala
late /home/Florian/workspace/Bug/src/core/Color.scala
late /home/Florian/workspace/Bug/src/core/Colored.scala
```
I'll investigate further under which circumstances the problem occurs. Would the eclipse.log help?
