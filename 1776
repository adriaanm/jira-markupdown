No, no, you have it backwards.  I have tried the following:

1) compiling from ant, using 2.7.2 Scala, our stuff.  Works great.

2) compiling from ant, using 2.8.nightly Scala, our stuff.  Works great.

3) compiling within Eclipse, using 2.7.3? plugin, our stuff.  Spurious errors.

4) compiling withing Eclipse, using 2.8.nightly plugin, our stuff.  Spurious errors.

What I've been trying to do, is see if the result comes from weird combinations of compiler/library versions that I am accidentally mixing, and to the best of my ability to separate them, it does not.  I've also checked that I followed the Scala instructions for configuring projects, and to the best of my ability to follow and check my work, I have followed those instructions.

I am NOT, NOT, NOT at all skilled with Scala. (3 "nots" = "not", right?)

This is NOT, NOT, NOT a transient error.  It is persistent, across versions of Scala, releases of the plugin, versions of Eclipse, and changes to our source base.

We don't require that our users install the Scala plugin, but those of us who work on Fortress from within Eclipse, are thinking about not using Eclipse anymore.  It seemed to reasonable to complain for a while before quitting.

Another possible cause -- Eclipse is running under 1.5, the project is hosted under 1.6.  Problem?
