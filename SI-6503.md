The generated html files (e.g. index.html) contains both an XML processing instruction:

    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>

and a doctype declaration:

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

But some browsers (e.g. Google Chrome) are so strict that when this page is served as an XML document, it will complain about a lot of problems and will refuse to render the page as expected.

When serving a document from a web server without a Context-Type HTTP header, Firefox will treat it as text/html, but Chrome will treat it as XML.

It is easy to workaround. Directly opening an index.html file from the local filesystem has no problem. Serving the document as Content-Type: text/html also works.

But this does not change the fact that the document is invalid.
