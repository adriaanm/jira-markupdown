`import scala.language.experimental.iKnowWhatImDoing`

I think I needed that import once when I was using `VirtualFile`, around the same code.

I'm not sure the spec has been updated, but the experimental feature import `iKnowWhatImDoing` is to the `scala.language.odersky.L3` competency level what `asInstanceOf` is to the type system.

Easter egg: `import iKnowWhatImDoing._` totally disables type checking! /kidding
