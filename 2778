For instance, given the following,
{code}
val p1 = Path(.scala_dependencies")
val p2 = p1.parent.map(_.resolve(p1.name))
}}

It should be the case that p1 == p2 is true. That's not the case currently.

Nb. if Path.parent is fixed in the obvious why, then it should probably return a Path rather than an Option[Path].
