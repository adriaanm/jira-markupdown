Scala version 2.8.0.r19800-b20091124095705 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15)
Mac OS X 10.6.2

In the attached file Crash.scala I have a pattern match on Array ("hello", mech) which in the trunk (r19800) causes an uncaught TypeError exception (see attached stack trace in Crash.err).

This works in version 2.7.7.

If the variable pattern mech is replaced with the constant pattern "there", all is well.
