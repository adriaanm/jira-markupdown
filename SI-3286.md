`scala.xml.PrettyPrinter` seems to change the values of attributes in some instances, by replacing repeated white space. Not always, though.  

Notice in the example below how 
```scala
<babba orth="B    A"/>
```
turns into 
```scala
<babba orth="B A"></babba>
```
after `PrettyPrinting`:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> <abba orth="A    B"><babba orth="B    A"/></abba>
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <abba orth="A    B"><babba orth="B    A"></babba></abba>

scala> new xml.PrettyPrinter(200, 2)                    
res1: scala.xml.PrettyPrinter = scala.xml.PrettyPrinter@1886a34

scala> res1.format(res0)                                
res2: String = 
<abba orth="A    B">
  <babba orth="B A"></babba>
</abba>
```


Crazy width and indentation nukes the multiple whitespaces in the attributes of both nodes:
```scala
scala> new xml.PrettyPrinter(2, 20)  
res8: scala.xml.PrettyPrinter = scala.xml.PrettyPrinter@1f0f0c8

scala> res8.format(res0)           
res9: String = 
<abba orth="A B"><babba orth="B A"></babba></abba>
```
We ran into this problem when checking whether some XML attributes were identical to the original input.

I guess you should be able to trust `Pretty Mr Printer` not to change the values of any attributes? 

Since I'm far from an expert in XML, I might be wrong about what is the correct way of treating whitespace inside attribute values.  Sorry if this already works according to the XML specs.

Kind regards,
