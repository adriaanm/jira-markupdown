Calling .getGenericReturnType or .getGenericParameterTypes on that specific method object fails with a jl.reflect.GenericSignatureFormatError

It is possible that the Scala compiler produces invalid classfiles for other cases as well, but I only had problems with this method for now.

```scala
  classOf[List[_]].getMethods.find(_.getName == "orElse").get.getGenericReturnType
```



> What is the expected behavior?
a return value of type jl.reflect.Type

a java.lang.reflect.GenericSignatureFormatError

This bug means that you cannot use Scala libraries in Java projects in Eclipse. 
This is a huge problem for interoperability and is hopefully treated as a very high priority item and I would expect to be reason enough, if nothing else, for a 2.8.2 release.

Example of Eclipse failure:


```scala
package foo;

import scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1;

public class MyFunction1 extends AbstractFunction1<Double, Void> {
    public Void apply(Double d) {
        System.out.println(d);
        return null;
    }
}
```
This leads to Eclipse vomiting this:

`Inconsistent classfile encountered: The undefined type parameter A is referenced from within Function1<T1,R>.$$anonfun$$compose$$1`
(In r24063) Taking a ride from 106 invalid generic signatures to zero.
Closes #4067.

Numbers 1-72:
Problem: Primitive types appearing in generic bounds.
Response: Use the boxed types.

Numbers 73-105:
Problem: Doubly nested classes can become Outer<T>.Inner.Inner2
Response: Don't allow dots except immediately following angle brackets.

Number 106:
Problem: Array may be being used as a higher kinded type,
and in such cases should not receive the special Array treatment.
Solution: args.nonEmpty

Observe my claim is that 106/106 signatures have been made
"valid", not "correct" or even "more nearly correct." As to that
I would like a second opinion.  And.... review by moors!

I second that.

A year down the line, I'm starting to ask myself if I should have taken the Scala road at all. 

Sometimes this whole ecosystem seems too flaky to believe.

The proffered solution is either:

A) Upgrade everything to nightly

OR

B) Download and install a tool from someone I've never heard of, which updates itself from god only knows where and does something that I don't understand to a load of my production binary files. 
Last time that happened it was a present from the Cult of the Dead Cow.

Both of the above are extremely lame. Extremely lame for a project that's trying to be taken seriously. And that writes a ton of books about how great it is.

Here's how I read the situation:

2 months ago we released a STABLE release of our much vaunted, non-binary compatible between releases project. 

Unfortunately, (especially as one of our main selling points is binary compatibility with Java), our project is not binary compatible with Java as it generates invalid class files.

We've fixed it in Version Control and will bundle it with our next release, which will occur at some indeterminate time in the future. 

In the meantime you can all just sit on your hands because you can't integrate your Scala libraries with your Java systems.

Oh, alternatively you could download all your Scala dependencies and recompile them to the (unreleased) 2.9.0.

Except they break.

Right now we're too busy writing research papers, inventing new words, writing books about how great the system is or doing consultancy to bother with this, the actual business of writing software.

I'm very exited with scala and I'm eager to use it more. I understand your emotions, but still I don't feel this is a blocker issue.

How does this issue really affect integration with java?

I only noticed a problem in eclipse auto completion, the eclipse java compiler is happy otherwise, javac too; are there other issues?

Instead of moving to the head build of the scala compiler, please consider using my jar postprocessing tool at:

Jar postprocessing tool. 

Firstly I did download it, I don't know who you are so I ran it under an zero privilege user account. It didn't work. I forget the exact error message. 

I'm glad it didn't work. Because if it had worked I would have just patched our production code-base with unknown modifications provided by someone I've never heard of via the Internet.

Lets be honest, if I had an employee and they did that, I'd fire their ass.

If the tool is legitimate why does the Scala project not run it upon the libraries which they release?

When I download from Ubuntu, Redhat, Microsoft, Oracle or any other provider the product works. I don't need to download a binary modifier from an unknown third party to get them to work. 

I don't even know why I'm entertaining the idea. It's so far off of what's considered responsible or normal project behaviour. I know I'd be laughed out of the office if I told them I'd done it.

So seriously, when will I be able to compile Scala files and use them in Eclipse without sending my workspace red?

Bryan,

I don't want to put down your complaints on stability of Scala; it's a rather widespread feeling.

Despites all that I still choose to invest in it, since I find that the advantages might outweight the costs of fighting with rough edges.

Hence, I would really grateful if you find some time to provide more details on the kind of issue you are having. You mentioned eclipse projects issuing build errors. Can you please provide some sample code that breaks the compiling of mixed scala and java?
Try implementing `Function1` or extending `AbstractFunction1`. Good luck.

Not sure I understood you comment. Do you mean that there are issues implementing Function1 or extending AbstractFunction1 in java? Any issues would be related to this particular generic signature bug or other causes?

I tried your code and as expected it broke the eclipse build:

```scala
!MESSAGE Error in JDT Core during reconcile
!STACK 1
Java Model Exception: java.lang.ClassCastException
        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.CompilationUnitProblemFinder.process_aroundBody0(CompilationUnitProblemFinder.java:233)
        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.CompilationUnitProblemFinder.process_aroundBody1$$advice(CompilationUnitProblemFinder.java:246)

        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.CompilationUnitProblemFinder$$AjcClosure3.run(CompilationUnitProblemFinder.java:1)
```

It seems that scala List causes the problem. I tried to change to Seq[Topic] and it worked fine.

I drilled down and I found a minimal test case which exhibits the same problem:
```scala
public class Test {
	public void simpleTest() {
		scala.collection.immutable.List l = null;
	}
}
```

I built the code with javac without problems; eclipse breaks though.


I tried my patched scala library file and eclipse manages to build this test code.
I deduce that this problem was indeed caused by the generic declarations and not another thing, despites the radically different eclipse stack trace.

Here is the git repo which reproduces the problem. You can see that:

1. javac compiles the code with an unpatched scala-library.jar
2. eclipse builds without errors when using the patched scala library


https://github.com/mmikulicic/scala-test-generics
Replying to [comment:31 nilskp]:
> Try implementing any generic trait in a pure Java project, or extending any generic class. I suggested AbstractFunction1.

Thanks. Eclipse spits:

```scala
Multiple markers at this line
	- Inconsistent classfile encountered: The undefined type parameter A is referenced from within Function1<T1,R>.$$anonfun
	 $$compose$$1
	- Inconsistent classfile encountered: The undefined type parameter A is referenced from within Function1<T1,R>.$$anonfun
	 $$compose$$1
```


Ant (javac) compiles though.

I tried with the patched jar and the problem is still there, so I guess some other signature declaration issue.

(https://github.com/mmikulicic/scala-test-generics, branch "function1")

----

Here's the dump of the generic signatures for class Function1.$$anonfun$$compose$$1

```scala
visiting class scala/Function1$$$$anonfun$$compose$$1, signature null
method <clinit> signature: null 
method apply signature: (TA;)TR; 
method <init> signature: (Lscala/Function1<TT1;TR;>;)V 
```

I tried to encode the similar idea in plain java:

```scala
public abstract class Test<T1,R> {
    public abstract R apply(T1 v);
    
    public <A> Test<A, R> compose(final Test<A, T1> g) {
        final Test<T1, R> self = this;
        return new Test<A, R>() {
            public R apply(A x) {
                return self.apply(g.apply(x));
            }
        };
    }
}
```

```scala
visiting class Test$$1, signature LTest<TA;TR;>;
method <init> signature: null 
method apply signature: (TA;)TR; 

visiting class Test, signature <T1:Ljava/lang/Object;R:Ljava/lang/Object;>Ljava/lang/Object;
method <init> signature: null 
method apply signature: (TT1;)TR; 
method compose signature: <A:Ljava/lang/Object;>(LTest<TA;TT1;>;)LTest<TA;TR;>
```

Where Test is the equivalent of AbstractFunction1 and Test$$1 is the equivalent of scala/Function1$$$$anonfun$$compose$$1.

So I suspect that the scala compiler is not emitting the generic declaration for the anonymous class
representing the anonymous function expanded from (I omitted the @specialized anno for readability):

```scala
trait Function1[-T1, +R] extends AnyRef { self =>
  def apply(v1:T1): R
  override def toString() = "<function1>"

  /** (f compose g)(x) ==  f(g(x))
   */
  def compose[A](g: A => T1): A => R = { x => apply(g(x)) }
```

Does this always happen? or only when there is some recursive type definition like this one?
(Actually the (A => R) return type should mean Function1[A, R])

Perhaps it's better to handle this in another ticket, since it seems that it's not caused by a malformed signature but a missing signature.
Ithkuil,

It's been fixed since Changeset 24063. 

It would be cool is if they would backport and release a version 2.8.2 with these fixes.

great news

Yes, I think I wouldn't feel comfortable moving to unreleased 2.9.0 yet in order to benefit from this. I also don't think it would be easy to monkey patch the signatures in this case, except if it happens only in a couple of well known places.

I was always in agreement on the solution; I was just proposing a quick hack to solve one of the two problems, but a hack is not a solution :~~). But if I were affected by the second issue, I wouldn't mind to have a hack also for it, if there nobody from the Scala maintainers can invest effort in performing a backport and maintenance release. Just a pragmatic approach :~~)

Perhaps we should open a distinct ticket requesting for backporting this fixes to the 2.8.x series ?
