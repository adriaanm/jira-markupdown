`ICodeReader` is only used in the optimizer, and only used in the `GenASM` backend (which is the default in the Scala 2.11 series.)

It is responsible for reading bytecode of previously compiled classes and translating them into an intermediate representation called `ICode` that is used in the compilation pipeline. This allows inlining of methods under separate compilation.

So disabling `-optimize` is a valid workaround for this bug.
