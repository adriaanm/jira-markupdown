OK, I'll leave this as an enhancement: the Scala plugin has never promised to be able to support Scala files in a Java project.

Bear in mind that in such a case the .scala files would not be compiled because a Java project doesn't have a Scala builder or classpath container or any other Scala awareness.

Nevertheless, throwing an exception isn't ideal.
