I don't think that example stands up to scrutiny. If  `g1 || g2` really is constant true, then rewrite your proposed:
```scala
x match {
  case p if g1 => ...
  case p if g2 => ...
}
```
to just:
```scala
x match {
  case p if g1 => ...
  case p => ...
}
```
This will a) allow the compiler to verify exhaustiveness and b) will help the reader to understand the code.
