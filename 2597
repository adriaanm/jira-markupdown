(In r24083) A new murmur3 hashcode implementation contributed by rex kerr.
I'm really happy with it.  There is benchmarking code included
but you can use the pudding for proof: the compiler compiling
itself is clearly faster.  I deleted the existing murmur2
implementation which has never left trunk in a release.

There remain some possible points of improvement with inlining
and/or synthetic method generation, but this is a major improvement
over the status quo.  Closes SI-2537, review by prokopec.
