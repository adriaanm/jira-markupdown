Hi.

It seems  ticket SI-2357 has resurfaced and is affecting us.  I have attached a sample project.  Changing the variable from 'isoCode' to anything else works.

Cheers,

sorry, i don't know much about maven.. how do i reproduce it? i went to the console and typed "mvn compile", but got the following error:

{code}

Hi, I have attached two tarballs, please unpack under :

{code}
...../.m2/repository/org/scala-tools/maven-scala-plugin
{code}

This will get you to the test stage at which point you will get a build error.

Cheers,

OK, I could finally reproduce the failed test case (`Could not find a setter for property oCode`). However, I think this is not a bug of the scala compiler: when looking at the annotations of the classfile `DummyEntity.class`, they all seem to be correct (i used "jclasslib" to inspect the classfiles):

 * method `getIsoCode` has the `@Column` annotation
 * methods `setIsoCode`, `isoCode` and `isoCode_eq$$` have no annotations
 * field `isoCode` has no annotations

I think the problem is that the framework tries to interpret the method `isoCode` as a property getter, even if it does not have any annotations (maybe because the class is annotated by `@Entity`?). Obviously, it fails to find the corresponding setter `setoCode`.

Could you try to reproduce the problem using java source code?

Hi.

I should get time to reproduce this in Java this afternoon, just entering some scheduled downtime to do some load testing.  

Thanks,

Hi.

Java sample attached, this seemed to work fine first time.  Possibly a symptom of me doing it slightly differently, but this seemed the immediate way to proceed.

Hi.

So it was a symptom of doing it a slightly different way.  Good news it is not Scala, I had perhaps made an assumption because of the earlier ticket.  I will raise it with the appropriate framework.

Sorry for wasting your time.
