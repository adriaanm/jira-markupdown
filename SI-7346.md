My application was intermittently hanging on startup; examining the stack trace I was able to reduce to the attached test case. This test case reliably hangs for me; if I set a breakpoint or add a small sleep before the second thread is started (line 8) then the test case terminates normally.

(My larger application did not call ScalaRunTime directly, but I am unsure what exactly was triggering the initialization of ScalaRunTime)

I have reproduced the problem with the latest nightlies of 2.10.2 and 2.11.
I couldn't reproduce.
