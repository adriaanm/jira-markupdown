(In r22515) closes scala/bug#3486. members of implclasses are clones of the original trait members, but cloning discards a symbol's typehistory so that javaSig could not look at the symbol's type before erasure

fixed by having mixin do the cloning at the beginning of erasure and then updating the symbol's info to transform it to be valid in current phase
