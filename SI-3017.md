Consider:
```scala
scala> val xs=  List(1, 2, 3)
xs: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)

scala> val it = xs sliding 2
it: Iterator[List[Int]] = non-empty iterator

scala> it.next
res10: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> it.next
res11: List[Int] = List(2, 3)

scala> it.next
res12: List[Int] = List(2, 3)
```
I think it should stop after res11. grouped behaves the same wrong way.
(In r20777) Made sliding/grouped throw an exception when read past the end.
Closes #3017.
