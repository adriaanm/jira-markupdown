{code}
 scala> Array(List(1))
 res0: Array[List[Int]] = Array(List(1))
{code}

so far, so good. but then:

{code}
 scala> List(Array(1))
 res1: List[Array[Int]] = List([I@a12355)
{code}

yuck! I hope there isn't some inherent Java/Scala friction that prevents the expected output from being produced?
