A NumericRange with more than Int.MaxValue elements can be created, but is almost useless since we cannot use it: 

=== Reproduce bug ===

scala> object Test {val x = 1L to 1000000000000L}
defined module Test

scala> Test.x take 10

=== Propositions ===

- Reject such NumericRange at their initialization.
   PRO It seems that it suffices to remove the lazy evaluation of numRangeElements to do it.
   CON We need to evaluate it at initialization, it's a (small?) performance penalty
- Try to workaround the issue: many methods can be updated to avoid call to length.
   CON painful patch, implementation will not be harmonized with Range
   CON some methods cannot be rewritten (length ofr example)
   PRO We can use "long" NumericRange for some operations
- Don't do anything: keep it as a feature
