If I write

{code}
class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    override def doGet(request, response) { ... }
}
{code}

It is obvious that doGet can only have signature

{code}
    override def doGet(request: HttpServletRequest, response: HttpServletResponse) { ... }
{code}

This seems to be easy to implement, and easy to write specification. However this change saves a lot of typing.
