If I write
```scala
class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    override def doGet(request, response) { ... }
}
```

It is obvious that doGet can only have signature
```scala
    override def doGet(request: HttpServletRequest, response: HttpServletResponse) { ... }
```

This seems to be easy to implement, and easy to write specification. However this change saves a lot of typing.
