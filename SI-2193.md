Since HashMap.values returns an iterator that does not implement Iterable it's very hard to map some variables to those HashMap values.

Here's an example:
{code}
var list = List(
  HashMap( 0 -> "a" ),
  HashMap( 2 -> "c" )
)

print( list.flatMap( x => x.values ) )
{code}

The compilation fails because flatMap expects Iterable objects but no Iterators. There are several other methods that expect the same input type. But this could be easily fixed: Iterator just needs to implement Iterable and should return itself.
In the 2.8 collection library, `HashMap` has a member `valueIterable`, which does exactly what you want:
{code}
var list = List(
  HashMap( 0 -> "a" ),
  HashMap( 2 -> "c" )
)

println(list.flatMap(x => x.valueIterable))
{code}
