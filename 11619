Can you provide a bit more motivation for why it is important to have this syntax?

For instance, your for-loop could be more easily expressed by

{code}
val r = (1 to 1000).iterator.
  map{ j => println(s"iteration j = $j") }.
  filterNot(j => (j % 2) == 0).
  takeWhile(_ <= 5)
{code}

If you are making instead an argument about efficiency, it would help to show benchmarks.  It is far from clear that your approach yields a nice tradeoff between speed and power (i.e. as much of both as possible).
