I've coded these features, please let me know if there are more would-be-nice-to-haves:

Plugin can opt out when it processes options; phase can opt out via enabled property; phase can declare that it "requires" other phases to be installed; phase can declare that it wishes to replace or delete another phase (where replace means delete and inherit its ordering constraints).

Also, -Xshow-phases shows the configuration with opt-outs. Using -Xshow-phases -Ydebug will include the phases that opted-out (e.g., no -P:continuations:enabled) with a helper footnote.

I deleted my deletion of Phases since **soc** has it covered.
