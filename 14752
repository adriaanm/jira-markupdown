Hello.

The compiler complains when one tries to define a class with a volatile member in the constructor.

Example:
```scala
class Cls(@volatile var v: Int)
```


Error message:
```scala
error: values cannot be volatile
class Cls(@volatile var v: Int)
```

The reason is because v gets expanded into a field and both an argument to the constructor. The field becomes a variable, but the argument to the constructor is a value, still having the same annotation - so the typechecker complains.
