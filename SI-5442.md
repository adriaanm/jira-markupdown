If it is expected the mixed optimized and unoptimized bytecode breaks down this way, we need to record the optimization status in the bytecode and fail the compile when people try to mix.  (If it's not expected then of course fixing it is the way to go.)

If I have an optimized build of the compiler, and then recompile something unoptimized (e.g. run ant all.clean build-opt, touch a file, run ant build) I run into crashes like this:
```

uncaught exception during compilation: java.lang.IllegalAccessError
error: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access field scala.reflect.internal.StdNames$nme$.$outer from class scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Typers$Typer
	at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Typers$Typer.typedSelect$1(Typers.scala:3816)
	at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Typers$Typer.typed1(Typers.scala:4356)
```
Indeed, the bytecode diff of StdNames with and without -optimise shows:
```
-private final scala.reflect.internal.SymbolTable $outer;
+public final scala.reflect.internal.SymbolTable $outer;
```
So when compiled under -optimise the $outer field is made public, but when StdNames is compiled  normally it is not, at which point anything which was compiled under -optimise contains a latent IllegalAccessError.
That field was made public to enable accessing it from another class compiled alongside `StdNames`, and that access, yes, is motivated by an inlining.

Currently, classes not compiled alongside `StdNames` just see the field public and use it, notwithstanding that the ex-private, synthetic, field in question might show up as `private` under other circumstances.

Given that the field's synthetic origin still can be traced from its name (contains a dollar sign), we could let the inliner keep publicizing (to allow intra-library inlining) yet have the inliner regard as private those dollar-sign fields it finds in external libraries (thus missing some opportunities of inter-library inlining).

What do you think?

I am afraid there may be more consequences to non-deterministic access than this one.  And "contains a dollar sign" would ideally not be a condition upon which anything important is based.  Sometimes I wonder why we work so hard to finesse access when it can generally be evaded anyway.  Just for the sake of argument, what would the consequences be if we always generated public fields (under -optimise and not) for everything accessed from a method marked @inline?
I simply derived a candidate solution from a problem statement, a solution that passes certain criteria. Perhaps we don't agree on the problem statement, the criteria, or there's a counterexample showing not passing the criteria. To recap:

- Problem: Accessing a private member at runtime, defined in a library L, from a library C (for Client), where C was compiled against L', an optimized version of L. 
The only such members are fields, either synthetic or isParamAccessor, and thus having a dollar sign in their name (the accesibility of methods and constructors isn't touched by the inliner).
- Criteria: Compile C (either optimized or not) against any of L or L', so that it runs with either L or L' (in particular, compiled against L' and runs with L).
- The candidate solution I mention makes the inliner test for dollar signs when compiling C, to be on the safe side. A dollar sign being present results in taking a conservative action (no inlining, thus not trying to access that field at runtime, thus no IllegalAccessError). 

In case you can find a counterexample, please let me know. For the time being the solution looks ok to me (given the problem statement, etc.)


The branch at [recoveringOptimizedStability](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/recoveringOptimizedStability) solves some long standing issues:

- inliner now publicizes fields only when actually inlining, [af864b0d4fcc ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/commit/af864b0d4fcc8b9e312585e1357a9ec8f0bd3e91)
  (because previously the inliner over-eagerly made fields public, even if inlining later failed for some reason)
- avoids inlining getters and setters, [73054f8884754edc ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/commit/73054f8884754edc57547920f9086b191e22bc24)
  As this results in exposing a private field, which may itself prevent inlining of the caller (at best) or
  {{IllegalAccessError}} at worst.
- The commit above also contains a safety check to consider as private, for the purposes of inlining, a public field that is presumed synthetic (due to a dollar sign in its name). 

A good thing of the approach above is that all the inlinings we care about (closures) are made.

I still need to test stability, but please feel free to offer your comments.

Getting "optimized stability" to run uncovered a bug, resulting from actually emitting as private fields that had been marked to be public. That's why an `IllegalAccessError` could still happen, in spite of running programs (compiled with optimization) with optimized libraries. 

I hope this brings confidence in the inlining policy (the focus of our discussions). The policy is fine, an aspect of its implementation was wrong.

Commit [bff1efd6093d43 ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/commit/bff1efd6093d43daaf79817b2dfc23276b0f4b58) fixes that bug (that bug is a blocker for optimized stability). It would be great if you could review the commits in the [recoveringOptimizedStability ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/recoveringOptimizedStability) branch.
At this point the branch [recoveringOptimizedStability ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/recoveringOptimizedStability) already passes `ant nightly`, inlining most of what used to get inlined before [23ae258c37bd5de05 ](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/23ae258c37bd5de050ae9d8b4287dc8c309af8de)

There are further ideas to gain more robustness (e.g., using unpickler to detect what the original accessibility of a field was, rather than ICodeReader contenting itself with a bytecode-level public flag), but feel free to review the branch. Comments are welcome.

From the laundry-list of improvements and suggestions mentioned so far, I've picked two categories (recovering optimized stability, and refactoring of `InliningPhase`) as candidates for inclusion in 2.10-M5. Those changes are tracked in #5891 . The corresponding pull request will be a beautified version of branch [recoveringOptimizedStability ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/master...recoveringOptimizedStability) . 

As before, the focus of #5442 remains finding a more robust way to avoid `IllegalAccessError` (eg using unpickling as mentioned in the previous comment).
