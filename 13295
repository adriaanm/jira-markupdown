The following code produces an error
{code}
object test {
/*

/*

*/
}
{code}
However, the summary of syntax in Appendix A of the SLS says:
{code}
comment ::= ‘/*’ “any sequence of characters” ‘*/’
{code}
Section 1.4 does say that multiline comments may be nested, but does not express the requirement that they be properly nested.
