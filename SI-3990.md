Scala version
"2.8.0.final"


== Problem Description ==
--------------------------------
* In the Scala 'prompt'/interpreter, tab-completion (AKA autocomplete) is NOT working.
[[BR]]

It simply inserts a TAB-character.

* This behaviour is the same in both xterm (X11) and Terminal.app
[[BR]]

* I do not know whether this is a "core" Scala issue or a JLine problem.
[[BR]]
[[BR]]
FWIW,
[[BR]]
in Terminal.app, Scala does not play well with `readLine` either: I have to use the `rlwrap` workaround.

[[BR]]

* This makes repl-usage/-exploration difficult.
[[BR]]

Especially in situations where it is required (*per the repl's own guidelines!*)

{code}
scala> :power
** Power User mode enabled - BEEP BOOP      **
** scala.tools.nsc._ has been imported      **
** New vals! Try repl, global, power        **
** New cmds! :help to discover them         **
** New defs! Type power.<tab> to reveal     **  <====== REPL is asking for TAB to "see more details" !!

{code}



In contrast,
[[BR]]

 this works fine on a Linux host: hitting TAB offered me method-name completions as expected.

* Sought feedback on mailing-list[[BR]]

This was one of my initial-impressions that I was seeking community feedback from on the `scala-users` mailing-list: have already received very useful feedback on the other issues[[BR]]

Yep, you're right about my environment being suspect here.

[[BR]]
I did this on my Mac:
{code}
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
sudo mv /etc/bashrc /etc/bashrc.bak
{code}

[[BR]]
Sure enough, completion works well after this (temporary) change.
[[BR]]

Thanks for taking a look!

In my .bashrc, I was setting a shell-variable "EMACS" to point to one of my emacs installations..
[[BR]]
[[BR]]

From `man bash`
{code}
       EMACS  If  bash  finds this variable in the environment when the shell starts with value "t", it assumes that the shell is running in
              an emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
{code}

Simply using a less Powerful (!!) name for this variable 'fixes' the issue, and scala-completion works again.
To add to the knowledge base here:

I also experienced this lack of autocomplete on OS X 10.11.4, using Scala 2.11.7. I did not have EMACS set in my environment, but did have EDITOR exported to the value "vim". After exiting the scala REPL; running *{{unset EDITOR}}*; and then starting scala again, autocomplete on the repl appears to work perfectly.

I did not investigate whether setting to other values of $EDITOR made a difference, but it's interesting that my scala's autocompletion was hindered by an env variable that had nothing to do with emacs, either by name or value.
