From a [comment on the PR](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5323#issuecomment-239489363):
```
You may want to mention [JEP 193|http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193] and that the cheapest safe way to pass a list to another thread is by the pair java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.setRelease / VarHandle.getAcquire (available in Unsafe on JDK8). With standardization of these operations in JDK9 (Jep 193) programmers should have plenty of tools for safe concurrency.
