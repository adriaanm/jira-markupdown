compiler produces unhandled exception in this self-explanatory snippet:

{code:scala}
package object Bug {
  // final class Test { - OK
  // object Test { - OK
  trait Test { // need to be trait
    //private val outer = 1 - OK
    private[this] val outer = 1 // need to be private[this]
    val inner : Int => Int = x => x + outer //generate any closure
  }
}
{code}
I should apologize for duplicating issue( https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5508 ). There is no excuse in lacking searching skills since the previous ticket was opened by myself
