This code should print first the stars and after that the number three. However, it seems that setting the context does not have any effect.

{code}  val w = new StringWriter()

  val engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("scala")
  val c = new SimpleScriptContext()
  c.setWriter(w)
  engine.setContext(c)

  engine.eval("println(3)")

  println("***")
  println(w.toString()){code}
I just bumped into this myself...and it's crippling my project. 

-Is it possibly a result of https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6c48941f0961a17647a6c95022d13fef3ab1f956 ?-
(No, that didn't land until 2.11.6)
Just to show it's not just {{setWriter}} that's borked; {{setAttribute}} doesn't work either. SI-7916 asserts {{get/setBndings}} is toast too :

in {{sbt console}}
{noformat}
import javax.script._
val engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("scala")
val iMain = engine.asInstanceOf[scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain]
// now we play settings/classpath games so this works in sbt console
class MyClass
iMain.settings.embeddedDefaults[MyClass]
iMain.settings.usemanifestcp.value = true
def getPath(className: String) = java.lang.Class.forName(className).getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath()
def compilerClass = "scala.tools.nsc.Interpreter"
def langClass = "scala.Some"
val compilerPath = s"${getPath(compilerClass)};${getPath(langClass)}"
iMain.settings.bootclasspath.append(compilerPath)
iMain.settings.classpath.append(compilerPath)
// OK, game on:
val c = new SimpleScriptContext()
c.setAttribute("foo", new Integer(5), ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE)
c.setAttribute("foo", new Integer(6), ScriptContext.GLOBAL_SCOPE)
import java.io.StringWriter
val w = new StringWriter()
c.setWriter(w)
engine.setContext(c)
engine.eval("println(foo)")
w

[~MaggieL] Scala's JSR 223 support is "minimal"; it came in as a community contribution. further improvements submitted by the community would be very welcome, but it's "out of scope for the Scala team". quotes are from https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-874. I've put the "community" tag on this and SI-7916. if there's somewhere in the documentation or the Scala website that you think inappropriately oversells our level of support for JSR 223, please point them out and I'll make sure the wording gets changed.
I may have misunderstood http://docs.scala-lang.org/scala/2.11/ when it and the 2.11 release notes showed "JSR-223 Scripting Engine support" as a feature in 2014, thinking that the "out of scope" comment from 2011 no longer obtained. Not knowing the players or being familiar with the processes in the project, I didn't twig that @rjolly (whose PR it was) isn't part of "the Scala team".  

I spent a *lot* of time going though gyrations trying to get the classpath right in our sbt-based Play app so we could actually get a Scala `ScriptEngine` started in the Java library we were calling from Scala, only to find that once I did, it wasn't possible to read or write variables into the script environment from Java. 

This was a huge disappointment. Certainly `javax.script.ScriptEngine` says "ScriptEngine is the fundamental interface whose methods must be fully functional in every implementation of this specification."; there's no notion there of a "minimal support" level, so when it doesn't work, it's just a bug. I haven't researched deeply into back releases of 2.11 (we were on 2.8 until I led an effort to get us to 2.11 that was substantially motivated by wanting to use JSR-223) but based on the example in the "Overview" it looks to me like this part of it actually worked at some time in the past. 

I looked into this a bit. scala.Console is a singleton, so overriding the behavior of println only in code running in a particular IMain instance would not be straightforward â€” especially in the presence of multiple threads.

the following workaround bypasses the official JSR 223 API but may be useful, regardless:

{noformat}
scala> import javax.script._
import javax.script._

scala> val e = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("scala")
e: javax.script.ScriptEngine = scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain@7d2c345d

scala> val baos = new java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream
baos: java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream =

scala> val ps = new java.io.PrintStream(baos)
ps: java.io.PrintStream = java.io.PrintStream@36224f93

scala> Console.withOut(ps)(e.eval("List(1,2,3).foreach(println)"))
res1: Object = null

scala> baos.toString
res2: String =
"1
2
3
"
{noformat}

JSR 223 is vague on various points, but what it says is: "Implementations whose scripting languages have well-defined constructs to display character output, must use the Writer returned by the getWriter method for this purpose."

So a snippet that uses `println` can have an appropriate method injected or imported. (Similarly print and printf.) That avoids Console.out.

It's too bad the `Predef.read` methods are deprecated because they would serve the same purpose.

Otherwise, the solution is for the script engine to `Console.withOut` etc before evaluation. That also takes care of invoking components that use Console.

This uses Console.withOut.
