Grr ... this time with the right formatting ;-)

For instance, given the following,

{code}
val p1 = Path(.scala_dependencies")
val p2 = p1.parent.map(_.resolve(p1.name))
{code}

It should be the case that p1 == p2 is true. That's not the case currently because p1.parent returns None.

Nb. if Path.parent is fixed in the obvious why, then it should probably return a Path rather than an Option[Path].
