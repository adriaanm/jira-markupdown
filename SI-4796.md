Only HashSet has findEntry, but it's quite useful generally to be able to retrieve the objects stored in a set (without traversing the entire set).
The method `findEntry` is useful when you want to replace a `Map[T, T]` with a `Set[T]`. That is, when the equality method does not cover other state of `T` that you need.

For example, imagine a symbol table in an interpreter where each symbol `S` is associated with it's definition. When you find an assignment to `S`, you need to create a new definition for `S`, or change the value in the old definition, so that whatever else was referring the previous definition still does so. In such a case, you try to find `S` in the set, and change that, or add a new `S` to it if not present.

Or, put in more stark terms, you need `findEntry` when equality is not a replacement for identity.

As a side note, a `Set` with `findEntry` can be used to implement a `Map`.
That would slow down quite a bit contains, which is the primary method. On a public library, were you don't having something to profile against, and particularly when it comes to collections, DRY must take second place to performace, if the two are mutually exclusive. In this case, however, you can have a private method returning `null` for not found, and two public methods returning `Boolean` and `Option[A]`, without sacrificing performance.

Also note that `FlatHashTable` is an implementation. Do not conflate implementation with the API -- `containsEntry`, for instance is not the public API; `contains` is the public API. Likewise, perhaps a different name for `findEntry` would be preferable. I do have my own thoughts on this, but I'd rather this be discussed more broadly. After all, we are talking about expanding the **public** API of `Set`, which is not done lightly.
It was made protected, not removed. It can be overridden with a public modifier at the Set level, if needed, but there's the question of the return type. I don't like `find` because that method has another type signature, and method overloads are best avoided. I'd pick an unused name, but, again, I think that's a discussion that must happen elsewhere, such as scala-debate or scala-language.
This was just requested again on the ML.

Once enough API proposals accumulate, they'll ask paulp to implement them in psp-std.
