The problem is with type argument inference, rather than with unification. AFAIK, scalac **never** infers a partially applied type constructor, even if it is handed to it on a plate, as in your example.

So probably a duplicate of scala/bug#2712, although Adriaan will be the final arbiter of that.
```scala
trait TypeWithHKParam[D[_]]

def function[D[_]](t: TypeWithHKParam[D]) = 1

function(null: TypeWithHKParam[Option]) //okay 

//Does not compile
function(null: TypeWithHKParam[({type l[a] = (Int, a)})#l])
```

Very nicely reported bug, BTW.
