too much errors of this kind even with types like Int and String. 
```
  caught scala.reflect.internal.Symbols$CyclicReference: illegal cyclic reference involving value interpolatedExprIdx: while typing beforePos.indexOfSlice("${", openingQuotePosition)
/Users/wedens/Documents/Projects/vim-scala-completion/src/main/scala/vim/scalacompletion/completion/CompletionTypeDetector.scala:39: error: recursive value interpolatedExprIdx needs type
          val interpolatedExprIdx = beforePos.indexOfSlice("${", openingQuotePosition)
```
is this problem comes from typer or my compiler calls may do something that breaks typer?

large amount of typer errors explains why completion sometimes is not working on some variables..
