From Scala Reference it is not clear whether lazy vals can be used from within a method body. The Reference doesn't deny such use, but doesn't guarantee it either. As it is, currently both Scala-2.6.1-final and Scala-2.7.0-final support using lazy vals in method body; but the new NetBeans plugin wasn't, because of that uncertainty in the Reference. Perhaps the Scala Reference should be updated a bit to reflect that lazy vals can be used in a method body. [[BR]]
For example, the phrase "The lazy modifier applies to value definitions" can be changed to "The lazy modifier applies to value definitions (occuring both in class definitions and in function definitions)" or in some other way. [[BR]]

FYI, I found an example of lazy values being used inside the function body [http://scala.sygneca.com/faqs/language#what-s-the-difference-between-a-lazy-argument-a-no-arg-function-argument-and-a-lazy-value in the Wiki]:
{code}
Lazy values allow you to turn call-by-name lazy arguments into call-by-need lazy arguments.

   def foo(x: => Bar) = {
     lazy val a = x
     //...
   }
{code}
I think it's a documentation error. 

In ScalaReference:
FunDef ::= FunSig [‘:’ Type] ‘=’ Expr
| FunSig [nl] ‘{’ Block ‘}’
| ‘this’ ParamClause ParamClauses
(‘=’ ConstrExpr | [nl] ConstrBlock)

Where Expr or Block allows:
BlockStat ::= Import
| [‘implicit’] Def
| {LocalModifier} TmplDef
| Expr1
|

So, only [‘implicit’] is allowed preceding Def in BlockState (thus FunDef's body).

I think it should be something like:
BlockStat ::= Import
| {‘implicit’ | 'lazy'} Def
| {LocalModifier} TmplDef
| Expr1
|

or 
BlockStat ::= Import
| {Modifier} Def
| {LocalModifier} TmplDef
| Expr1
|
