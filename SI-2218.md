abstract class test {
  
    def f(n:Int):Unit
    
    def faire = {

        val n = 0

        def f=f(n)

        ()

    }
}

This fails to compile at def f=f(n) because the compiler doesn't see that there already is an f function in scope, (def f(n:Int):Unit above) and hence considers the inner declaration as recursive

Error: recursive method f needs result type
