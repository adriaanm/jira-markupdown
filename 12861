Compiling the following code lures Scalac into not terminating. The problem seems to arise from the interaction between the existential type and pattern match in `answer`.
```scala
object PhoneSystem extends Application {
  class Phone {
    trait Call
    case class Message extends Call
    def answer(m: p.Call forSome { val p: Phone } ) = m match {
      case Message() => ()
    }
  }
}
```
