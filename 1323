Noting for the record that I reverted this patch after martin reported it changed the behavior of this snippet, because Byte doesn't have the static type of Char:
```scala
val buf: Array[Byte]

def processVerbatim(i: Int, end: String): Int = {
      val END = end.charAt(0)
    
     def processCode(pre: String, i: Int): Int = {...
        buf(i) match {
          case END if startsWith(i, end) =>
            // return
}                                                                               
```
Interestingly I can't reproduce this in a simple example, but I did reproduce the behavior in verbfilterScala.scala, and I did verify that reverting the patch for this ticket restored the original matching behavior.
