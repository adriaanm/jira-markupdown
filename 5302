Ai. I was thinking, the compiler could respond to this with an ambiguity error in B. To solve the ambiguity, use either 
```scala
object B extends A { "foo" } {}
```
or
```scala
object B extends A {} { "foo" } 
```

(or any permutation with parens instead of curlies ofcourse)

However Liskov prevents that, because A can still not be used anymore where it could before.

So yeah, you got me :-)

Can't think of any new solution!

Thanks for playing! :-D
