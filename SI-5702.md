The pattern parser halts when it sees stars.  This means it does not handle infix notation for a case class named "*".  (This is an edgy use case.)

Also, the error reporting around syntax errors could be improved, both to provide helpful hints and for recovery, to report subsequent errors.

This is related to #3189, which no longer crashes, but doesn't yet report nicely.

```scala
object Test {
  case class *(a: Int, b: Int)
  type Star = *
  case class P(a: Int, b: Star) // alias still required

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val v = new *(6,7)
    val x * y = v   // OK, where sequence pattern not allowed
    printf("%d,%d\n",x,y)
    val p = P(5, v)
    val P(a, b * c) = p  // error
    printf("%d,%d,%d\n",a,b,c)
  }
}
```

Sample improved message:
```scala
t3189.scala:2: error: use _* to match a sequence
  val Array(a,b*) = ("": Any)
                ^
one error found
```

A patch is forthcoming.
The patch forthcame at
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/444

The patch tries to honor the history of the code, e.g., #3480, #1764, #1878 and the proximate #3189, by not being too ambitious.  As usual, this was a GLE (great learning experience) and hopefully the tests provide adequate coverage (as in cover me).
