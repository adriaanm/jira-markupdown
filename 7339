Btw Vlad, I just looked at it-- in html/page/Index.scala, members of the package objects don't seem to be included in `pack.templates` (which is what's filtered and ultimately makes up the list of entries to be shown in the index pages): https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/html/page/Index.scala#L64

So even if you ask for packages to be included in the filtered results, still no members of package objects show up.
