Apparently, it was always like this:

{noformat}
$ ../scala-2.10.4/bin/scala -Ylog-classpath hello.Main
Classpath built from (-d = . -Ylog-classpath = true)
Defaults: object Defaults {
[snip]
After java boot/extdirs classpath has 1 entries:
  directory classpath: .
Classpath built from (-d = . -Ylog-classpath = true)
Defaults: object Defaults {
[could I see that again?]
After java boot/extdirs classpath has 1 entries:
  directory classpath: .
hello, world.
{noformat}

The runner builds the class path once to see if it has something to run, and a second time to run it.
