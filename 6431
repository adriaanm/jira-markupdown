Actually, it works as expected as a Value (Case 2)

{code}
scala> contraLBUB
res9: Contra[A] = null

scala> contraLB
res10: Contra[Any] = null
{code}

So the question is, does "Case 3: Methods" explain these?

{code}
scala> contraLBUB()
res11: Contra[C] = null

scala> contraLB()
res12: Contra[C] = null
{code}
