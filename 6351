Judging by the conversation, the resulting commit, and the fact that all seems to build and run:
```scala
Heathers-iMac:scala-heather hmiller$ ../badsigs/badsigs.sh ../scala-heather/classes
Root is /Users/hmiller/Dropbox/git-shared/badsigs
Working dir is /tmp/badsigs.vsQMC
Badsigs JAR is /Users/hmiller/Dropbox/git-shared/badsigs/target/badsigs-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Checking /Users/hmiller/Dropbox/git-shared/badsigs/../scala-heather/classes:
Running Main app (will generate Java files and run ecj)
Heathers-iMac:scala-heather hmiller$ 
```

All seems resolved, so I'll be closing this.
