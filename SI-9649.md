When the scaladoc is accessed locally the html-title is set correctly. However, if the documentation is hosted on line (i.e. scala-lang.org) it duplicates the title string.

My guess is that this has something to do with the title being set from the {{iframe}} - however, this has not been verified.

A tip if you want to upload this somewhere to check: place the docs in a public folder on dropbox.

Update: the error is not present in 2.9.x http://scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.9.x/#scala.AnyVal
