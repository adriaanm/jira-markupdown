There doesn't seem to be any ticket for this yet even though many of us see this message all the time:

```scala
[warn] doc-version (3.2.0-SNAPSHOT) was too long to be displayed in the webview, and will be left out. The max length is: XX.XX.XX-XXX
```

While spewing this message into the log for every page is a problem (once should be enough), the bigger issue is that longer version numbers are discarded. Even overflowing them in the HTML pages would be better than that. It may be ugly but at least it's still usable. Currently there is no way to tell what version you're looking at when it comes from a "non-release" build (e.g. the SHA-versioned builds we do all the time for the Scala distribution).
The "spewing" should have been fixed by merging: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5063 and as such should only give this message once per run - is this not the case? :(

Regarding the version number, we have this currently:

```scala
// src/scaladoc/tools/nsc/doc/html/page/Entity.scala:163
if (version.length > "XX.XX.XX-XXX".length) {
  docletReporter.summaryWarning(s"doc-version ($version) was too long to be displayed in the webview, and will be left out. The max length is: XX.XX.XX-XXX")
  ""
} else version
```

The point here was, as you said - to eliminate weird overflow in the UI. It is slightly, albeit not wholly, incorrect to say that there is no way to know which build you're looking at - since the title header (i.e. the tab-pane) should contain the version number still. Perhaps an alternative would be to display the full version number in the footer (regardless of strlen)?
I built 90bced5b65 just now and received that warning more than once. More than 2^11, in fact.
```scala
% ack 'was too long to be displayed in the webview' log.txt  | wc -l
    3082
```
@paulp, I did:

```scala
$ git grep -in "was too long"
```

Yields nothing for me - clean your build? I think @adriaanm fixed this with: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2a74683cb588d64e30be9fa66eb5f2b8027d3446.
I've really come full circle when I get to hear "clean your build". No, cleaning the build doesn't make any difference.

```scala
% git clean -fxd .
% sbt publishLocal
