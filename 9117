I just got eaten with the update to Scala-IDE 3.0.1 which uses Scala 2.10.2, and so is not usable on our project. 
So, that bug is starting to be **really** annoying. 

All in all, I prefered the past behaviour, with hundreds of assert error lines in the log. Our build output were crap, but actually could build the project...
