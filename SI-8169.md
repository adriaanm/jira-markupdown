Using .view on a list generates slower code than expected. The following excerpt can be cut and paste in a scala console.

```scala
def time[T](f: => T):T = {
    val before = System.currentTimeMillis
    val res:T = f
    val after = System.currentTimeMillis
    println(after-before)
    res
}

val resolved = Map("42" -> "yay")
val seq = Array.range(1, 50).map (_.toString).toList

// warmup run
time { (1 to 100000).foreach { i => seq.view.flatMap( resolved.get(_) ).headOption } }
time { (1 to 100000).foreach { i => seq.find( resolved.contains(_) ).flatMap( resolved.get(_) ) } }

// replay for good now that we're warm
time { (1 to 100000).foreach { i => seq.view.flatMap( resolved.get(_) ).headOption } }
time { (1 to 100000).foreach { i => seq.find( resolved.contains(_) ).flatMap( resolved.get(_) ) } }
```

Obtained: the penultimate figure (using .view) is consistently over 250ms in my box, the last one below 100ms.
Expected: the two last figures should be in the same ballpark (the .view implementation actually performs one less map lookup than the .find one, but manages to be slower)

I assume this is one more avatar of a default implementation of .view getting in the way, but the rest is way over my pay grade.
OK, I don't want to be a pain :)  And to be fair, I don't think this is major either.

I just found out by profiling with yourkit that using the exact pattern (that one developer in our team absolutely loves) was having some impact on our app (about 50ms of pure cpu on autocompletion requests) at a place where I was not expecting it.

Rewriting them with a find was improving things significantly. As using a view honestly felt like "the right thing to do" from a FP pov, I am just concerned that there might be some unnecessary entropy generated with the best of intentions here.

Anyway, let's retry without the map lookup, to get it out of the way, even if the test case feel ridiculous now.

```scala
def time[T](f: => T):(T,Long) = {
    val before = System.currentTimeMillis
    val res:T = f
    val after = System.currentTimeMillis
    (res, after-before)
}

val seq = Array.range(1, 50).map (_.toString).toList

(1 to 10).foreach { j =>
    val (a,t1) = time { (1 to 100000).foreach { i => seq.view.flatMap( i => if(i == "42") Some("yay") else None ).headOption } }
    val (b,t2) = time { (1 to 100000).foreach { i => seq.find( _ == "42" ).map( a => Some("yay") ) } }
    println(s"view:$t1 find:$t2")
}
```

I get this: 
```scala
view:388 find:71
view:136 find:36
view:148 find:28
view:134 find:28
view:124 find:28
view:119 find:29
view:124 find:34
view:120 find:32
view:123 find:29
view:119 find:31
```

By playing on the constants (bigger list, element looked for further down) i get similar results: the view version is three to four times slower.
