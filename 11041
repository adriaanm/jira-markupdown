making the fields ~~volatile~~ transient seems appealing to me. the lost “safety” seems to me like nothing anyone would have expected or counted on anyway. I would actually have expected the fields to be ~~volatile~~ transient in the first place.

I'm not sure I've understood it fully, but perhaps the issue with readResolve is something we could simply document?
