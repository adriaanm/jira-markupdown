This particular defect is gone but I would regard the current behaviour on https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/358427/scaladoc/index.html as incorrect.

Focucsing on {{scala.annotation.meta}} works. Only {{scala.annotation.meta}} is shown.

Focucsing on {{scala.annotation}} kind of works. We now see {{scala.annotation}},  {{scala.annotation.meta}} &  {{scala.annotation.unchecked}}. Including the child packages is is not so useful.

Focucsing on {{scala}} does not work. It does not restrict the packages because {{scala}} is at the top level. This should be regarded as a defect.

{{Hide}} has more useful behaviour. Hiding {{scala}} hides only the direct members of the {{scala}} package.

On the basis of the rather general title this issue has I would say we are not done yet.
