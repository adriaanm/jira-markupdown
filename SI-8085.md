The following was exctrated from the Coursera Reactive class assignment:

```scala
// nodescala/package.scala
import scala.concurrent.Future

package object nodescala {
  implicit class FutureCompanionOps[T](val f: Future.type) extends AnyVal {
    def always[T](value: T): Future[T] = Promise[T].success(value).future
  }
}

// nodescala/NodeScalaSuite.scala
package nodescala

import scala.concurrent.Future

class NodeScalaSuite {
  Future.always(517) //<-- error reported
}
```

The reported error is: "value always is not a member of object scala.concurrent.Future"

I've managed to create a presentation compiler test that demonstrates the problem, will be pushing a patch with the failing test soon.
Here is a link to the commit containing the test: ~~9c40363a38339e987b092f4bd08b305b64e4d49b~~ https://github.com/dotta/scala/commit/7cab3dbc68c93061155dfa25a9938d6fccd12386

~~And I'm attaching that commit as a .patch to this ticket.~~ (The discussion in the ticket proves it's better to reference a link)
Finally, below is the output of the test:

Needs a bit of minimization.

```scala
//package.scala
package object nodescala {
  def Foo: Int = 0
}
```

```scala
// NodeScalaSuite.scala
package nodescala

class NodeScalaSuite {
  Foo
}
```

This sort of problem means the `openPackageModule` hasn't been triggered, which adds the members of package objects to the package. I'm not sure if the presentation compiler test you created is even meant to to work, though: it doesn't look at `src/*`, does it? Poking around for source files that contain package objects is the domain of `BrowsingLoaders`.
@JasonZaugg I'm confused, why do you think the test doesn't do what it should? Also, if you uncomment [this line](https://github.com/dotta/scala/commit/9c40363a38339e987b092f4bd08b305b64e4d49b#diff-fbe672622018892fa284de6e005504c2R7), the test succeed, which is why I believe the the test is meaningful - but I might be missing something. As far as I can tell, the issue is that the package object needs to be explicitly loaded, otherwise the presentation compiler gets confused. What you say about `openPackageModule` makes sense to me, so indeed my test case may be too specific (compared to the one you provided in your previous comment).
If you uncomment that line, you are telling the compiler where to find the definition of the package object.

But I believe that without that line, the fact that you put the package object under a file in `./src` is no different to putting it in `./tmp`; the presentation compiler test won't know that it exists.
In your failing test, the parser emits `package <empty> { import s.c.Future; package nodescala {} }`.

This logic in Namers:

```scala
    /** All PackageClassInfoTypes come from here. */
    private def createPackageSymbol(pos: Position, pid: RefTree): Symbol = {
      val pkgOwner = pid match {
        case Ident(_)                 => if (owner.isEmptyPackageClass) rootMirror.RootClass else owner
        case Select(qual: RefTree, _) => createPackageSymbol(pos, qual).moduleClass
      }
```

.. needs to be reflected in BrowserTraverser.
