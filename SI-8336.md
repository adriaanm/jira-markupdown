Would be nice to be able fold `Try` when wrapping unsafe operation ; e.g.:

```
val msg = Try(inputStream.toInt).
  fold("NumberFormatException for " + _, "Valid int: " + _)
```

In same spirit, having `Try` as `Either` could be useful.
FWIW,

```scala
scala> Try("junk".toInt) transform (i => Try(2 * i), e => Try(-1))
res3: scala.util.Try[Int] = Success(-1)

scala> Try("junk".toInt).toOption.fold(-1)(2 * _)
res4: Int = -1
```
