The packaging of Ant which ships with Fedora 8 is broken in a way which causes any exec task with the vmlauncher property set to "no" to fail. This is a known Fedora 8 bug,

This causes the Scala build to fail on F8 (previously mentioned as part of #290), and also on Mac OS X which has a similarly broken default Ant install.

The Ant external launcher was a workaround for a bug in early JVMs on Windows. This no longer applies: I've been able to build successfully with vmlauncher set to the default "yes" on Windows XP under VMWare with a Sun 1.6.0 JDK, Ant 1.7.0 and the Subversion 1.4.6 Windows client binaries from tigris.org.

This being the case, build.xml should switch to using the default vmlauncher property value to allow a clean "out of the box" build on more platforms.
