This bug means that you cannot use Scala libraries in Java projects in Eclipse. 
This is a huge problem for interoperability and is hopefully treated as a very high priority item and I would expect to be reason enough, if nothing else, for a 2.8.2 release.

Example of Eclipse failure:
```scala
package foo;

import scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1;

public class MyFunction1 extends AbstractFunction1<Double, Void> {
    public Void apply(Double d) {
        System.out.println(d);
        return null;
    }
}
```
This leads to Eclipse vomiting this:

`Inconsistent classfile encountered: The undefined type parameter A is referenced from within Function1<T1,R>.$$anonfun$$compose$$1`
