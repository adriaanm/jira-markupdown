In r18789, TextBuffer.append was changed to include !isSpace(sb.last). This assumes that sb.last is a quick operation. Sadly, as of last week, it relies on TraversableLike's implementation:

{code}
  def last: A = {
    var lst = head
    for (x <- this)
      lst = x
    lst
  }
{code}

That has a disastrous effect on the performance of PrettyPrinter (and anything else that relies on a fast last operation).

Maybe StringBuilder should inherit from IndexedSeqOptimized?
