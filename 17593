I've 2 files that have only one difference - "\r\n" sequence in the test.txt
[vladimir@vladimir tmp]$ cat test.txt
line1
line2
line3
[vladimir@vladimir tmp]$ cat test2.txt
line1
line2
line3[vladimir@vladimir tmp]$

I try to execute in the REPL:

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/test.txt").mkString(",")
res17: String = 
,l,i,n,e,1,
,l,i,n,e,2,
,l,i,n,e,3,
"

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("/tmp/test2.txt").mkString(",")
res18: String = 
,,i,n,e,1,
,l,i,n,e,2,
,l,i,n,e,3

scala> 

As you can see, for test2.txt file the first "l" character ommited. I think, that it isn't expected behaviour.
