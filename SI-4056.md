What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)?
 1. Open [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections_5.html The sequence traits Seq, IndexedSeq, and LinearSeq]
 2. Look for the description of "xs(i) = x"

What is the expected behavior?
{code}
Changes the element of xs at index i to x.
{code}

What do you see instead?
{code}
Changes the element of xs at index i to y.
{code}

Hmm, Martin seems busy. And I can't assign Heather Miller (the documentation czar!) because JIRA doesn't list her.

@EPFL people
Could you change http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/?
