One way out of this particular pickle would be to teach the typechecker that the glb of Char and Int is Nothing, and likewise for the other value types. I think that would fix the problem." from https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-language/mThYtcdajfc/9b3wJa2VOwAJ

So, reopening the ticket but reclassifying it as an enhancement. Martin's suggestion wouldn't help the java.lang.Long/Integer case Paul noticed, but oh well.
