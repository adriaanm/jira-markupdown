Import statements and class constructors doesn't mix well. For example, this works fine:
```scala
object TestObject {
  def x = 3
}

class TestClass(i : Int) {
  def this() = {this(TestObject.x)}
}
```
but doesn't:
```scala
class TestClass(i : Int) {
  import TestObject.x
  def this() = {this(x)}
}
```
this doesn't work either:
```scala
class TestClass(i : Int) {
  def this() = {import TestObject.x; this(x)}
}
```
I find this behavior inconsistent with normal import rules.
