Using Eclipse 3.3.1.1 on Windows XP SP2 with plugin 2.7.0.14001-RC2_0, the attached projects fails to compile. In the .zip file there is .log as well as all relevant project files. The compiler settings were all defaults, except "optimise" option was enabled. If the "optimise" option is disabled, the project compiles.

```scala
object bug extends Application {
    test
    final class iterator(from: int, stop: int) extends NotNull {
	def foreach(f: int => unit) = {
	    var i = from
	    while (i < stop) {
		f(i)
		i += 1
	    }
	}        
    }
    implicit def range(stop: int): iterator = new iterator(0, stop)
    final def test: int = {
    	for (i <- 10) if (true) return 0
    	0
    }
}
```
Fixed in #14803.
