In http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Map

the signature for method map is:

{code}def map[B, That](f: ((A, B)) â‡’ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That{code}

Where the 1st, 3rd, and 5th occurrences of "B" are a type parameter, and the 2nd and 4th refer to the type of the Map's values (I may have it wrong, but you get the idea). The docs should use two different letters.

Duplicate of SI-6046 (at least.)
