{noformat}
~/newbug % cat S.scala
object S { final val x = 0 }
~/newbug % cat J.java 
public class J {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(S.x());
  }
}
~/newbug % /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1/bin/scalac -Xcheckinit S.scala                 
~/newbug % javac -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1/lib/scala-library.jar J.java
~/newbug % java -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1/lib/scala-library.jar J

But if I change "final val" to just "val", then it works:

{noformat}
~/newbug % emacs S.scala
~/newbug % cat S.scala 
object S { val x = 0 }
~/newbug % /usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1/bin/scalac -Xcheckinit S.scala                 
~/newbug % javac -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1/lib/scala-library.jar J.java
~/newbug % java -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.9.0.1/lib/scala-library.jar J
0
{noformat}

The same thing happens with 2.8.1.

The value for x is inlined into the accessor method, which leads to the field never getting assigned.  So the -Xcheckinit result is actually correct: it is indeed uninitialized, it's just that nobody was ever going to look at it until -Xcheckinit poked his nose in.

If we just didn't generate the field as discussed in SI-4605 then this would take care of itself.
