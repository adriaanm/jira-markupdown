I have to automatically create a lot of JNDI environment variables like the following: 

<Environment name={key} value={value} type="java.lang.String" override="false" />

Now no matter what I do, Scala will always put the "name" attribute last, i.e. change attribute ordering and also expand my empty tag. I searched the mailing list for a solution to the expanding problem, but in Snapshot 2.8.0 there doesn't seem to be an easy one. The end result is this:

<Environment value={value} type="java.lang.String" override="false" name={key}></Environment>

Now I'd love to have the attribute order preserved, as scanning  variables (with my human eyes :) ) by the "name" attribute in a jndi config file is a very common thing to do. I can live with the tag expansion, even though it adds a bit of bloat and wonder why Scala expands my empty tag in the first place: I would write down the expanded version if I wanted to.

Thanks guys!
