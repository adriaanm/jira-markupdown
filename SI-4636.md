on windows 7, the 32bit java version installs under c:\program files (x86). In scala.bat JAVA_HOME is used and he parenthesis confuse the batch interpreter. 

The solution is to use setlocal ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION and replace %JAVA_HOME% with !JAVA_HOME!

This is also available in windows XP 
The patch seems to only cover the second part of the solution, without the setlocal statement. This is a common problem, getting more common as 64 bits windows become more widely used. Also, it is widely misdiagnosed. Thumbs up for this patch!
(extempore in [r25124](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25124)) Quoted the windows runner path so "c:\program files (x86)" has some
chance of working.  Closes #4636, no review.
