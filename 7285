As of 90d2bee45b this example works, but any call to getSimpleName can still crash us, and there are still classloader issues: at the moment you have to pass -nobootcp to run this from the command line.
```
% pscala -nobootcp Test
Running
constructor Foo$3
method _3
method copy$default$3
method copy$default$2
method _2
method _1
[etc]
```
