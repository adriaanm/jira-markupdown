Thanks for omitting that little detail in the ticket.  But you overestimate your ability to eliminate possibilities - if you were that good at it you'd have a reproduction.

> I'm trying to accommodate you to the best of my ability, but shutting me down without a second thought only discourages me from posting such issues in the first place. 

I'm **trying** to discourage you: all signs still point to user error.  You have no idea the aggregate cost of bogus tickets.  If you can't give us a self contained reproduction, we'll somehow get by with only 500 other tickets to keep us busy.
