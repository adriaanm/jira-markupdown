Hitting enter inside a multiline string literal in the line where it starts inserts a '" +' before the newline and a '"' in the newly created line. This is good and useful behavior for normal, single line string literals, but it is very annoying for multiline string literals.

For example, if I hit <enter> after the word 'hello' in the following code:

    println (""" hello 
    	          arno""" + 7*9)

the result is this:

    println (""" hello" +
    		" 
    	          arno""" + 7*9)

I would expect this:

    println (""" hello
    		 
    	          arno""" + 7*9)
