When I use a java library that returns a Vector, then use JavaConverters 'asScala' to convert the vector to the Scala equivalent and then try to match on the type in flatMap to do processing, I get a compiler crash.

no-symbol does not have an owner

This worked in Scala 2.9, but it hasn't worked in any version of 2.10.

Code would be something like this:
channel.ls.asScala.filter( _ match .flatMap( _ match {
            case e: LsEntry => Some(rootPath + "/" + e.getFilename)
            case s => None
        })
    }


If I add channel.ls.asInstanceOf[Vector[LsEntry]] to the code, the crash goes away.

Here is a very simple sbt project that demonstrates the problem.

A workaround is to match on {{_: Outer#Inner}}, rather than on a type alias for the same type.

Fix for 2.10.2:

This is SI-6813, right?
I think SI-6813 is a separate missing dealias.
