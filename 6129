We've not added any new stuff in Scala 2.11. We've focussed on making it easier to maintain Scala and contribute to it, by cleaning up our infrastructure, modularizing the library (and starting to modularize the compiler).  

Fixing DelayedInit would likely require deprecating it and replacing it by a new feature, possibly the one proposed in SI-4330.
As you know, this is quite a tricky problem that has been (re)-designed several times.

Scala is an open source project. We do our best to facilitate and support community contributions, but we can't do everything ourselves as our resources are limited.
If you'd like to see this issue resolved, I suggest you team up with other potential users, write up a proposal and submit a PR.
