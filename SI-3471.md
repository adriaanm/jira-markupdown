This is related to my original issue 3089.

After the "-Xmigration" changes, the ++ method and several other methods of ListBuffer (really BufferLike) now obey the Traversable contract.

However I just now discovered some methods that don't obey the Seq contract:

{code}
+:
++:
{code}

The points that I made about the other methods still apply:  These methods work as advertised if the object to which they are applied is typed as Seq, even if it is really ListBuffer, therefore they should work correctly (and not give deprecation warnings) if the object is typed as ListBuffer.

{code}
scala> import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer
import scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer

scala> new ListBuffer[Int]
res0: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer()

scala> 1 +: res0
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
res1: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1)

scala> res0
res2: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1)

scala> val s: Seq[Int] = res0
s: Seq[Int] = ListBuffer(1)

scala> 2 +: s
res3: Seq[Int] = ListBuffer(2, 1)

scala> res0
res4: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1)
{code}

That's the point.  They're deprecated but should not be because they're not deprecated in Seq, and BufferLike implements Seq (via Buffer).  So if I have a Seq that just happens to be (for example) a ListBuffer, then it works fine, but if I have a ListBuffer that' actually typed as ListBuffer, then I get deprecation warnings, and the methods behave differently (they append to the current LB instead of creating a new one).  See the example code.  The method should work the same (that is, create a new ListBuffer) regardless of the Seq type because that's what the Seq documentation says it should do.

I brought up the same issue in 3089.  There the solution was to add a "migration" annotation to flag methods that behave differently in 2.8.  (The difference being that in 2.7, +: modified the ListBuffer but in 2.8 it doesn't, and ditto for ++:.)  You can see the migration annotation in BufferLike.

I'm asking for the +: and ++: methods be modified to (a) create a new ListBuffer instead of modifying the current one as per the Seq contract, (b) remove the deprecation annotation, and (c) add the migration annotation.

You're right about ++:, it doesn't exist in Seq.

But +: does, and it works, even if the Seq is a ListBuffer.  It looks like +: and :+ were added in order to resolve the ambiguities and pitfalls surrounding using the + method with Seq.

All I am asking is to replace the definition of +: in BufferLike with the following:

{code}
@migration(2, 8,
    "As of 2.8, +: always creates a new collection, even on Buffers.\n"+
    "Use += instead if you intend to add by side effect to an existing collection.\n"
)
final def +:(elem: A): This = elem +=: clone()
{code}

Also while ++: doesn't exist in Seq, we've changed ++ in BufferLike to create a new buffer (instead of appending to the current one) so I think that if ++: is going to exist for buffers, it should work in a similar fashion.

{code}
@migration(2, 8,
    "As of 2.8, ++: always creates a new collection, even on Buffers.\n"+
    "Use ++=: instead if you intend to add by side effect to an existing collection.\n"
)
final def ++:(xs: Traversable[A]): This = xs ++=: clone()
{code}

Also I just realized that in the +: definition the migration message should say "Use +=: ..."


Actually I suppose that ++: is pointless because you can always swap the two sides and use ++.  So maybe it makes sense to leave ++: deprecated and get rid of it in a future release.
(In r23670) Recovered ++: from the dustbin and dropped it on Traversable.
Removed a very unfortunate deprecated method from BufferLike
which it was not authorized to deprecate because it's a Seq.
