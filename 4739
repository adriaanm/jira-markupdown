This has resurfaced again... this time with DSE graph and Scala 2.11.8, as in the following snippet:

{code:java}
val c = DseCluster.builder
   .addContactPoint(System.getProperty("cassandra.host", "127.0.0.1"))
   .withGraphOptions(new GraphOptions().setGraphName("mygraph"))
   .build
{code}

yielding the error:


{noformat}
Error:(22, 33) illegal cyclic reference involving class Cluster
 val cbuilder = new DseCluster.Builder()
{noformat}

The {{-Ybreak-cycles}} fix is confirmed to work
