This has resurfaced again... this time with DSE graph and Scala 2.11.8, as in the following snippet:
```java
val c = DseCluster.builder
   .addContactPoint(System.getProperty("cassandra.host", "127.0.0.1"))
   .withGraphOptions(new GraphOptions().setGraphName("mygraph"))
   .build
```

yielding the error:
```
Error:(22, 33) illegal cyclic reference involving class Cluster
 val cbuilder = new DseCluster.Builder()
```

The `-Ybreak-cycles` fix is confirmed to work
