=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
{code}
scala> TreeMap(1->2)
scala> HashMap(1->2)
scala> HashSet(1,2,3)
{code} 

Quite a few collection classes seem to miss a the right stringPrefix, which is used by toString to print useful information, at least:

immutable.HashMap
immutable.HashSet
immutable.ListMap
immutable.ListSet
immutable.SortedMap (-> immutable.TreeMap)
immutable.TreeMap
mutable.HashMap
mutable.HashSet
mutable.LinkedHashMap
mutable.LinkedHashSet
mutable.ListMap
mutable.ResizableArray

It would be nice to add them.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
{code}
res0: scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap[Int,Int] = TreeMap(1 -> 2)
res1: scala.collection.immutable.HashMap[Int,Int] = HashMap(1 -> 2)
res2: scala.collection.immutable.HashSet[Int] = HashSet(1, 2, 3)
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===
{code}
res0: scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap[Int,Int] = Map(1 -> 2)
res1: scala.collection.immutable.HashMap[Int,Int] = Map(1 -> 2)
res2: scala.collection.immutable.HashSet[Int] = Set(1, 2, 3)
{code}

Wow, you were fast with that one.  I took a second too long looking up the ticket number.  Curses!

I think there is definitely a place beyond which you don't go, and I don't know where the line is.  But in the absence of compelling reasoning, erring on the side of exposing fewer implementation details is the way to go.
