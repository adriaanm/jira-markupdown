The following code uses type refinement to prove the equality of two types. The equality sought is essentially the same in each case, but in one it succeeds and in one it fails:

{code}
object RefinementTest {
    sealed trait Grandparent[A]
    sealed trait Parent[A] extends Grandparent[A]
    case class Child[C](c: (C, C)) extends Parent[(C, C)]

    def extractParent[A](parent: Parent[A]): A = parent match {
      case child: Child[c] => child.c
    }

    // Fails
    def extractGrandparent1[A](grandparent: Grandparent[A]): A = grandparent match {
      case parent: Parent[a] =>
        parent match {
          //     Error: type mismatch;
          //     found   : (c, c)
          //     required: a
          case child: Child[c] => child.c: a
        }
    }

    // Works
    def extractGrandparent2[A](grandparent: Grandparent[A]): A = grandparent match {
      case parent: Parent[a] => extractParent(parent)
    }
  }
{code}
