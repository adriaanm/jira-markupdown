```scala
scala> u.showRaw(u.reify(1 == 2).tree)
res0: String = Literal(Constant(false))
```
Note that 1 == 2 is constant-folded and thus invisible to reify.

I reported this on scala-language. Quoting [Paul Philipps's answer](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-language/moNLpj7OpUc/discussion):

```
Operations on literals are folded relatively early, clearly before reify gets a shot at them.  This could in principle be changed - it wasn't a problem before now, for obvious reasons.

It's not completely trivial to change because we need to preserve the property that the folded literal has a constant type.  That is, the type of 5 + 5 is Int(10), not Int, and right now that comes for free since the tree is Literal(Constant(10)), not Apply(Select(Literal(Constant(5)), "+"), List(Literal(Constant(5)))).  I think it could be changed without any tragic side effects, but there's really only one way to find out.

"We could implement the undoing with some completely different mechanism..."

Don't do the wrong thing and then try, inevitably imperfectly, to undo it! Just don't do it! Why does constant folding have to happen before macro expansion?
