This was never properly implemented. The existing code simply creates aliases for the `Outer$$Inner` class in the outer class, so they can be easily accessed. This works fine for static (nested) classes, but fails for proper inner classes. I don't think it's too difficult to implement this, but there are some issues with circular dependencies. I'm not sure it will go in 2.6.2, though.
