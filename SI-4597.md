It's a consistent annoyance that there is no in-place (i.e. mutating) "filter" for mutable collections (or at least none that I can find!). Where one has a predicate, the best I can do is:
{code}
    shrinkable --= (shrinkable.view filter pred)
{code}

I think Shrinkable should contain one extra method:
{code}
    def shrink(p : A => Boolean) : this.type
{code}
The previous code then becomes the much cleaner and clearer:
{code}
    shrinkable shrink pred
{code}


{code}
shrinkable --= (shrinkable.view filter pred)
{code}

Is that even safe - you're modifying the collection as you're traversing it..
{code}
scala> val shrinkable = collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ,10)
shrinkable: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

scala> val shrinkable = collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
shrinkable: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

scala> shrinkable --= (shrinkable.view filter {_ > 5})
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: 8
	at scala.collection.mutable.ResizableArray$class.apply(ResizableArray.scala:42)
{code}

Granted, it does work for sets right now, but that's just correct due to undefined behaviour.
