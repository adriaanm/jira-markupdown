(In r24174) Enclosing method attributes.  There are at least two bugs. 1) traits
have no constructor by the time genjvm rolls around, so NoSymbol
emerges.  Maybe the author of these two lines was under the impression
that isClass == true implies isTrait == false, which it does not.

  assert(enclClass.isClass)
  val sym = enclClass.primaryConstructor

2) for reasons unknown the 0-arg constructor was hardcoded as the
enclosing constructor, which is the wrong signature in all cases
but that one.  Closes SI-4211, review by dragos.
