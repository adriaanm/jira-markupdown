My read of the situation is that the generated extension methods should be flagged as ARTIFACT, and the backend should add this to the excluded flag set.

I also notice the trait setter methods generate static forwarders.

Some more evidence for the ARTIFACT flag (yeah, I know that it doesn't quite count as a bug if you have to type '$'):
```scala
% cat test.scala
class Box1(val x: T) extends AnyVal {
  def foo = 0
}

% scalac test.scala

% scala

scala> Box1
res0: Box1.type = Box1$@7556cd93

scala> Box1.foo$extension _
res2: Box1 => Int = <function1>
```
