What's the reason to care about reference equality? Faster comparison, some subset of those comparisons are done in maps.

Regardless, the request is now for either deprecation of the special Symbol syntax, as it is misleading, or making it a compile time constant. Otherwise it serves no benefit and has the potential to make code perform slower in places where users are in fact trying to attempt the opposite.
