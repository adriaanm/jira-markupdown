Scala 2.8 Only.

If package object is defined in one file, then used in another file, the compiler generates errors when using types from the package object. Example:
```scala
package object tt {
    type Foo = Function4[Double, Double, Double, Double, Double]
}
```
```scala
object Main {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        import tt._
        def d: Foo = (a, b, c, d) => 5d

        println(d(1, 2, 3, 4))
    }
}
```

If package object is defined in the same file, then the error appears when the package object is defined after the import statement:
```scala
object Main {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        import tt._
        def d: Foo = (a, b, c, d) => 5d

        println(d(1, 2, 3, 4))
    }
}

package object tt {
    type Foo = Function4[Double, Double, Double, Double, Double]
}
```

Everything works when the package object is defined before the import statement in the same file it is used (code compiles and runs):
```scala
package object tt {
    type Foo = Function4[Double, Double, Double, Double, Double]
}

object Main {
    def main(args: Array[String]) {
        import tt._
        def d: Foo = (a, b, c, d) => 5d

        println(d(1, 2, 3, 4))
    }
}
```

The code also works when the package object is defined in a separate jar.
