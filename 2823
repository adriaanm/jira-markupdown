(In r19806) close SI-2665 and close SI-2667: use weak conformance in polymorphic case of isApplicable
reviewed by: odersky

exprTypeArgs now takes a comparison function: isWeaklyCompatible is passed in isApplicable's typesCompatible (to mimic what happens in the monomorphic case)
Martin: please review as this is different from my original proposal (that one broke type inference, this one passes all tests and does not slow down quick.comp)
