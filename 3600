Thanks for the fix! There are a couple that were missed:

- Page 74: "acc" should be "z" ("acc" is undefined)
- Page 105: missing "=" before skip method implementation block

The others deal with formatting rather than typos, so they're less important. And indeed the prime number example should state 1013 rather than 1003 - thanks for correcting!
