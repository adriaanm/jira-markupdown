For an unknown reason, the workaround of defining the mapper and reducer before the job stopped working when I added enough files to my project.  I didn't notice the problem until I made a change that caused sbt (v0.10) to have to recompile a few files.  Now I see an error like:
```scala
[error]  found   : java.lang.Class[MyReducer](classOf[MyReducer])
[error]  required: java.lang.Class[_ <: org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Reducer]
[error]     job.setCombinerClass(classOf[MyReducer])
```
