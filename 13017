Scala 2.6.1 final[[BR]]
Hope this is the right place to fill a possible bug[[BR]]
```scala

scala> 1 -> "prr"
res93: (Int, java.lang.String) = (1,prr)

scala> 1.->("prr")
res92: (Double, java.lang.String) = (1.0,prr)
```

I'm just starting with scala, but my understanding is that ` a->b ` is compiled into `  a.->(b) `, so the two expressions would give the same result. But in my test results are different, probably because scala is considering the dot as decimal separator and not as operator.

Feature or bug?
