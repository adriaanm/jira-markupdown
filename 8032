@Jason: I hope so too. I'll file the patch against 2.10 and revert it in master, so we should be back to normal.

I've had a look at the bugs that concern AnyRef specialization and it's not such a long list: scala/bug#6103, scala/bug#6043, scala/bug#4790, scala/bug#5976 and scala/bug#5583. If we make a big push to fix all of them by the next milestone, maybe we can re-enable the AnyRef specialization.
