@Jason: I hope so too. I'll file the patch against 2.10 and revert it in master, so we should be back to normal.

I've had a look at the bugs that concern AnyRef specialization and it's not such a long list: SI-6103, SI-6043, SI-4790, SI-5976 and SI-5583. If we make a big push to fix all of them by the next milestone, maybe we can re-enable the AnyRef specialization.
