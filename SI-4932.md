When writing scaladoc for an overrided member, it is convenient to be able to inherit the existing docs and extend them. Currently, it appears that you can either inherit or provide your own, but not merge the two. The simplest way I can think to address this is as follows:

```scala
trait Foo {
  /** Do interesting stuff. */
  def doStuff()
}

trait Bar {
  /** Actually does quite boring stuff. */
  override def doStuff()
}

trait Baz {
  /**
   * We make use of pixie magic to do stuff.
   */
  override def doStuff()
}
```

The scaladoc for Foo.doStuff() would be "Do interesting stuff." and the scaladoc for Bar.doStuff() would be "Actually does quite boring stuff.". However, the scaladoc for Baz would be:

```html
Do interesting stuff.

We make use of pixie magic to do stuff.
```

So, the rule is that if the scaladoc starts on the `/**` line, it is treated as the documentation. If the `/**` line is blank, the inherited docs are inserted followed by these docs.
The formatting seems wrong.

```
So, the rule is that if the scaladoc starts on the /\* line like:

{noformat}
/** blah blah
{noformat}

It is treated as the documentation. If the line is blank like:

{noformat}
/**
 * blah blah
{noformat}

The inherited docs are inserted followed by these docs.
```

Right?
Well, I agree the feature but I think people don't think there is a semantical difference between 

```
/** blah blah
```

and

```
/**
 * blah blah
```

so I prefer a Scaladoc tag too.
We have a working implementation of @inheritdoc, somewhat similar to [javadoc's inheritdoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#{@inheritDoc}) - currently in [pull request](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/69) state. 

More details and an example are on [the Scala Wiki](https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tags+and+Annotations).
In [pull request #69](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/69).
