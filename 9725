I don't know what language you think excludes tripled quoted strings from string interpolation, but this is the expected behavior. I see nothing for you to misinterpret this way; and whatever it is, it's about string literals, which start with " or """. Once you put an "s" in front of it, it is a string-interpolated string literal.
