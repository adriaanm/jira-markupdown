Okay, here's the explanation why it doesn't appear: The function is defined in {{GenericTraversableTemplate}} and redefined with {{@bridge}} in {{Traversable}}. In {{scala.collection.immutable.List}}'s linearization, {{Traversable}} comes before {{GenericTraversableTemplate}}, thus making the {{method flatten}} symbol bridge-annotated and filtered out by Scaladoc. 

One idea on how to fix that is to filter out `@bridge` methods ONLY if there are other methods with the same name in the template. What do you think of that?
