In 2.8 the command (quotes only to indicate space, obviously not there when actually running)
"scala> :load foo.scala "

would load up foo.scala fine.

Now this will result in a: "That file does not exist" error.

"scala> :load foo.scala"

works fine.

This is very annoying when using scala in something like the emacs shell, as it puts a space automatically after files when completing the name.
As Adriaan noted, this fix is obsolesced and isn't in a version used by modern humans.
