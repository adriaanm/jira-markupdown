```scala
scala> class C { @annotation.doesNotExist val foo = 1 }
<console>:7: error: type doesNotExist is not a member of package annotation
       class C { @annotation.doesNotExist val foo = 1 }
                             ^
warning: no valid targets for annotation on value foo - it is discarded unused. You may specify targets with meta-annotations, e.g. @(<error> @getter)
```
