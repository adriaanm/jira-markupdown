Is sbaz broken in Scala 2.6.1-RC1? I get the following error
when I try to run sbaz with any command:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalAccessError: sbaz.clui.Settings: scala.$$colon$$colon.hd()Ljava.lang.Object;
   at sbaz.clui.Settings.parseOptions(Settings.scala:105)
   at sbaz.clui.CommandLine$$.processCommandLine(CommandLine.scala:32)
   at sbaz.clui.CommandLine$$.main(CommandLine.scala:63)
   at sbaz.clui.CommandLine.main(CommandLine.scala) 
{code}


Although I can't duplicate this it may be that Rickard is using a different JVM, just as I may only get the problem within Eclipse because of classloading differences.

To reiterate:
  * I don't think this is an Eclispe plug-in problem
  * This is a high priority problem for me - it's preventing me from making progress!
