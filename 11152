Jason,

I've brought the issue down to mocking a {code}Function1[Any,Boolean] {code}

The problem seems to be around mocking something that takes an Any because if I change it to String it works fine.

I'll open an issue against scalamock, but I've attached the output of the compile with -Xprint:all for both AnyFunction and StringFunction.

The following is the entire test case:
```scala
  test("I can mock") {
    val f = mock[Function1[Any,Boolean]]
    (f.apply _).expects(*).returning(true)
    f("this is something")
  }
```
