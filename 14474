running the mailbox-example from http://programming-scala.labs.oreilly.com/ch09.html behaves different typed in in REPL and run in eclipse (3.5) or from an script (scala.bat script.scala).

both eclipse-plugin and scala updated today (2nd sept 2009) from nightly builds -> scala-version 2.8.x.
used java version 1.6.0_13


the output should be (and is typed in in REPL):
I've got 3 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 3 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 4 messages in my mailbox.

but run from eclipse or as script (parameter to scala.bat) the output is:
I've got 6 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 5 messages in my mailbox.
I've got 4 messages in my mailbox.


the scala-code in question:

{code}
// code-examples/Concurrency/actor-mailbox-script.scala

import scala.actors.Actor
import scala.actors.Actor._

val countActor = actor {
  loop {
    react {
      case "how many?" => {
        println("I've got " + mailboxSize.toString + " messages in my mailbox.")
      }
    }
  }
}

countActor ! 1
countActor ! 2
countActor ! 3
countActor ! "how many?"
countActor ! "how many?"
countActor ! 4
countActor ! "how many?
{code}


maybe related to that problem:

  the factorial-examples on the oreilly-site also don't work in eclipse
