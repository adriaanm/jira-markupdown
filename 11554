You'd have to check out my branch (see above), then compile it:

{code}
ant publish-local-opt -Dmaven.version.suffix="-fix-oom"
{code}

and modify your build:
{code}
final val scalaVer = "2.11.5-fix-oom"
...
resolvers += "Local Maven Repository" at "file:///"+Path.userHome+"/.m2/repository"
...
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" % "scalatest_2.11" % "2.2.1" % "test",
{code}

Then you can compile it with SBT.
