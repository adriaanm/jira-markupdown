{code}
object A {
  class C
  class D
  class H(x: C)
  implicit object H extends H(new D) with (C => D){
    def apply(v1: C): D = new D
  }

  class O(x: D)
  implicit object O extends O(new C) with (D => C) {
    def apply(v1: D): C = new C
  }
}{code}
This code should compile. However we have following message:

error: type mismatch;
found   : com.A.D
required: com.A.C
Note: implicit object O is not applicable here because it comes after the application point and it lacks an explicit result type
implicit object H extends H(new D) with (C => D){

This message is wrong, because implicit object O HAS explicit result type. So compile should compile this code or should change message.

P.S.
Of course this code is wrong, because leads to initialization exception, but it can be simply changed to be right and still showing this bug.
Nope. See this:


```scala

object A {
  class C
  class D
  
  class O(x: D)
  
  implicit def toD(x: C) = new D
  
  implicit object O extends O(new C) with (D => C) {
    def apply(v1: D): C = new C
  }
  
  class H(x: C)
  
  implicit object H extends H(new D) with (C => D){
    def apply(v1: C): D = new D
  }
  
}
```

That compiles. But, if you move the implicit conversion definition to the point after where it's needed, you get an error:

```scala

object A {
  class C
  class D
  
  class O(x: D)
  
  implicit object O extends O(new C) with (D => C) {
    def apply(v1: D): C = new C
  }
  
  class H(x: C)
  
  implicit object H extends H(new D) with (C => D){
    def apply(v1: C): D = new D
  }
  
  implicit def toD(x: C) = new D
  
}
```

```scala
t5197.scala:11: error: type mismatch;
 found   : A.C
 required: A.D
 Note: implicit method toD is not applicable here because it comes after the application point and it lacks an explicit result type
  implicit object O extends O(new C) with (D => C) {
                              ^
one error found
```

So this doesn't have to do with implicit objects per se.
I think this bug is legitimate, or at least warrants clarification.  The issue at hand is presented more clearly as follows:
```scala
object A {
  val x: Int = List("a")
  implicit lazy val O1: (List[String] => Int) = ???
}
object B {
  val x: Int = List("a")
  implicit object O2 extends (List[String] => Int) { def apply(x: List[String]): Int = ??? }
}
/*
./a.scala:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : List[String]
 required: Int
 Note: implicit object O2 is not applicable here because it comes after the application point and it lacks an explicit result type
  val x: Int = List("a")
                   ^
one error found
*/
```

object O2 is considered to be typeless.  I think it makes a lot more sense to either a) consider it to have type "O2.type" or b) failing that, to at least offer some means of giving it a so-called explicit result type.  Because right now there's no way to do it at all.  Naively, one might think this would work:
```scala
object C {
  val x: Int = List("a")
  implicit object O3 extends (List[String] => Int) {
    self: (List[String] => Int) =>

    def apply(x: List[String]): Int = ???
  }
}
```
But it doesn't.
We could also enable a syntax like this:
```scala
object (O: Int => Int) extends (Int => Int) { def apply(x: Int): Int = x }
```
This is not the only place where this is important.  It's increasingly problematic that there is no way to place a type ascription on an object to weaken its type.  It makes them useless in some situations and dangerous in others.
Yeah, I think your intuition about the cycles in the commit message is correct.
We're mostly worried about completion of the implicit's type requiring type checking the conversion we're inferring.
Whether the conversion is in an object is not relevant I think.
