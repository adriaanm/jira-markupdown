[This is a general enhancement]

if you declare a variable inside try block, it is not available in catch or finally sections, e.g.
```scala
try {
 val x = new Integer(0)
} catch {
 println (x) //syntax error
} finally {
 println(x) //syntax error
}
```
This design (present in Java, for example) creates a lot of boilerplate code. 
Typically, the catch and finally clauses are doing cleanup work, and therefore they NEED access to anything defined in try. 
So common pattern is to move the relevant declarations OUT of the try/catch/finally block, e.g. in Java:


```scala
MyClass x = null;
try {
 x = new MyClass();
} finally {
 if (x!=null) GarbageCollector.cleanup(x);
}
```
This is not very elegant:
[[BR]]
1) x is not really used outside of the block, so it clutters the namespace. In Scala, try can return a value if it is needed outside of try/catch/finally
[[BR]]
2) x is forced to be a var, but it my not have to be
[[BR]]
3) x needs a dummy initial value, which is quite useless, and often is null

I am proposing to move x inside try, but let catch and finally have it in scope
```scala
try {
 val x = new MyClass
} finally {
 if (x!=null) GarbageCollector.cleanup(x);
}
```
The only problem here is that x may not have been assigned a value (here due to exception in MyClass constructor). But can it simply be null in this case? Note that this code is equivalent to previous example, but simply does not expose x outside of the try/catch/finally block, plus lets it be a val
Note that the compiler would have to track which variables were not initialized, and provide a null default value

Null references are not actually encouraged in Scala, so we could implement this with Option instead
```scala
try {
 val x: Option[MyClass] = Some(new MyClass)
} finally {
 if (x!=None) GarbageCollector.cleanup(x.get)
 //or even GarbageCollector.cleanup(x), where GarbageCollector knows how to handle Option
}
```
This will require special handling of Option in the compiler, providing the value None for all variables where assignment has not happened

----

I have no idea how feasible it would be to fill in unassigned  variables with defaults, but definitely moving variables defined in try into scope for catch/finally and letting the programmer handle the complexities is already useful: 

```scala
try {
 val x: Option[MyClass] = None
 x = Some(new MyClass)//can throw
} finally {
 if (x!=None) GarbageCollector.cleanup(x.get)
}
```

I believe implementing this will result in cleaner(=less buggy) code
You've got my vote.  The currently necessary "var x: Foo = null; try {...}" pattern is a blight on the language.  The attempt to use Option is well-intentioned but a non-starter: yes null is discouraged, but it's also in the language and this is the kind of place where you suck it up and use it.  No upside to introducing more special rules.

I suggest this be considered in concert with #2807 because they both involve characteristics unique to try/catch/finally blocks, where including them in a generalization has unfortunate consequences and if we're willing to bend the rules a little when exceptions go flying we can remove some thorns from our paws.
The try blocks in the example only contains a single statement: an assignment to x.  So, either construction fails and x is uninitialized, or it succeeds and x is initialized.  You might as well just write:
```scala
  val x = new Integer(0)
  println(x)
```

Usually, you would perform some operation on x after construction and I assume you are claiming the usual idiom is insufficient:
```scala
val x = <construct>
try { f(x) }
finally { cleanup(x) }
```
Here is an example where catch needs  full context:
```scala
val result2 = try {
 val result1 = doThis()// can throw IOException
 doThat(result1) //can throw IOException
} catch {
 case _ => //want to rethrow with a descriptive message, but need to know which statement failed
  if (result1==null)
    throw new DescriptiveException("doThis failed")
  else
    throw new DescriptiveException("doThat failed", result1)
}
```
If we need to achieve the same thing with current implementation, we would have to take result1 out of try scope, and possibly enclose EVERY statement in try/catch 
```scala
val result1 = try {
 doThis()// can throw Exception
 } catch {
 case _ => 
  throw new DescriptiveException("doThis failed")
}

val result2 = try {
  doThat(result1) //can throw Exception
} catch {
 case _ =>
  throw  new DescriptiveException("doThat failed", result1)
}
```
OR
```scala
var result1 = null
val result2 = 
try {
 result1 = doThis()// can throw Exception
 doThat(result1) //can throw Exception
} catch {
 case _ => //want to rethrow with a descriptive message, but need to know which statement failed
  if (result1==null)
   throw new DescriptiveException("doThis failed")
  else
   throw new DescriptiveException("doThat failed", result1)
}
```
In real life you may have a dozen inter-related statements in a row, each resulting in some useful context, and each can throw, so multiple try/catch and/or external variables get quite messy

Also, suppose result1 needs to be 'closed' (has a resource handle, like DB connection). It is simple with what I am proposing:
```scala
val result2 = try {
 val result1 = doThis()// can throw IOException
 doThat(result1) //can throw IOException
} catch {
 case _ => //want to rethrow with a descriptive message, but need to know which statement failed
  if (result1==null)
    throw new DescriptiveException("doThis failed")
  else
    throw new DescriptiveException("doThat failed", result1)
} finally {
  if (result1!=null) close(result1)
}
```
Typically objects should not be used after they have been closed.  Since both examples of current implementation have moved result1 to external scope, we need yet another try/finally to close it and ensure it is out of scope for the rest of the code:
```scala
try { 
 var result1 = null
 val result2 = 
 try {
  result1 = doThis()// can throw Exception
  doThat(result1) //can throw Exception
 } catch {
  case _ => //want to rethrow with a descriptive message, but need to know which statement failed
   if (result1==null)
    throw new DescriptiveException("doThis failed")
   else
    throw new DescriptiveException("doThat failed", result1)
 }
} finally {
 if (result1!=null) close(result1)
}
```
It gets messier and messier...
Maybe it is time to revisit this? One of key syntactic conveniences of Scala is that try returns a value. But sadly it does not work conveniently with val's:

{code}val x  = try {
 val context = context()...
} catch {
 no access to context!
}{code}
We can solve it easily with re-assignment:

{code}var context ...
val x = try {
 context = ...
} catch {
 context is available here
}
```scala
but val is much nicer...

Implementation-wise, why can't we emit a block around every try, and place all variables defined inside try into this block?
```
{
 var context...
 val x = try {
  context = ...
 } catch {
  context is available here
 }
}
context is out of scope here
{code}
