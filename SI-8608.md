It would be nice if
```scala
f"hello, world"  // scala.this.Predef.augmentString("hi").format()
```
produced just a constant string.

That enables
```scala
f"$$ordinary"  // no cost
"$ordinary"     // looks like missing interpolator
f"$$ordinary%n"  // requires format, though could be improved
```

Locale is never used in rendering FixedString text.

But `f` just emits "hi".format() and the enhancement could be diverted:

```scala
package goodbye

import Predef.{ augmentString => _ }

object Test extends App {

  implicit class `bold format`(s: String) {
    def format(args: Any*): String = {
      Predef require args.isEmpty
      "goodbye, everybody"
    }
  }

  Console println f"hello, world"
}
```
It's not obvious that this is sipped behavior.  Someone wanting a special format could subvert the interpolator directly.

It will have to do some extra work since support for 
```scala
f"${BigDecimal(3.4)}%e"
```
is in the wrapper, which unwraps.
