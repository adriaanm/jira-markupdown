At the moment q"$core[..$targs](...$argss)" is going to match any tree. If the tree is not an application, then targs will be Nil, argss with be Nil, and core will be the entire tree.

This behavior is caused by the desire to have `val q"$core(...$argss)" = q"foo.bar"` working, which is I think a good thing, given the semantics of application in Scala. However, it also makes quasiquotes very permissive, which would probably lead to confusion.

I also assigned Critical priority to this issue, because if we release Scala 2.11.0 with this not fixed, then everyone's going to depend on this behavior, and we might break a lot of code when fixing this issue.

```scala
scala> val q"$expr[..$targs](...$argss)" = q"new C(1, 2)"
expr: reflect.runtime.universe.Tree = new C
targs: List[reflect.runtime.universe.Tree] = List()
argss: List[List[reflect.runtime.universe.Tree]] = List(List(1, 2))

@adriaanm What are our plans wrt RC3?
We're not aware of any reason to have one, and I hope it stays that way :-)
