[~retronym] actually it's simpler than that. Your example cannot compile without {{C2}} and {{C1}} being related; and even then, {{T1}} and {{T2}} need to be swapped in {{C3}} (that weird rule in SLS ยง5.1 about only allowing superclasses of the first non-trait class to appear after "with"...). So there wouldn't be much information lost when encoding in java.

Anyway, I think I have a fix, I'm looking into it.
