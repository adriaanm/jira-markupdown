It turns out that we have an implementation of WeakHashSet in a compiler:
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/util/WeakHashSet.scala

However, it's semantics are very fishy. I noticed two problems:
  1. The [{{WeakReferenceWithEquals}}|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/util/WeakHashSet.scala#L45] caches hashCode. Now imagine that two WeakReferenceWithEquals point at different objects so they store different hashCodes. Later on the underlaying objects get GCed so now {{equals}} return true (because {{null == null}}) but {{hashCode}} would be still different. That breaks the basic contract between {{equals}} and {{hashCode}}.
  2. We do not register a {{ReferenceQueue}} so {{WeakReferenceWithEquals}} instances themselves are never GC'ed and they block slots in has table. Check implementation of Java's WeakHashmap for inspiration how pruning of slots should be done.
Iulian, I agree that WeakHashMap[A, Unit] or WeakHashMap[A, Null] would be an improvement but we would waste a lot more memory than necessary in that case due to all WeakHashMap.Entry objects having unused field for value. If we want to use WeakHashSet in a very hot places we need to optimize more. See SI-7149 for details.
Michael, wrapping Java's {{WeakHashMap}} wouldn't help with the issue I mentioned in SI-7149 where we need an access to {{getEntry}} method to implement hash consing.
