In 2.8.0.RC2 (and probably for a while before that), the compiler throws Errors instead of Exceptions.  This is a problem because they propagate out of the compiler into calling code, which shouldn't trap Errors.

Specifically, I get a `TypeError` in #3417.  Looking at the source, there are others that inherit from Error as well, including `MalformedType` and `NoCommonType`.  This is problematic for sbt in particular, since it will exit from the unhandled Error instead of displaying an error and returning to the prompt.
Not completely sure, but it seems to be introduced here:
