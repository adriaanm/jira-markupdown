Hi,

I just read your installation instructions and installed a fresh copy of Eclipse 3.5 (build 20090920-1017) and JDK 1.6.0 Update 16. Also I installed Scala 2.7.6 Plugin via Software Install from Eclipse. Then I tried the verification steps you offer on your website:

When I start Eclipse and switch to scala perspective I can create a Scala-project and a package. But when I try to create an object I get an empty dialog (no entry fields) and nothing happens when I click "Finish". When I try to create an scala application I get a dialog box where I can enter the application name but again clicking "finish" does nothing.

What's wrong?

after searching for another hour I obviously found the reason: although I newly installed JDK 1.6, Eclipse still started with the older version 1.5! After uninstalling 1.5 Eclipse now uses JDK 1.6 and the Scala-Plugin works fine.

Sorry for that!

No, I'm on Windows XP and I had JDK 1.5.0_16 installed. Because of the requirements of Scala I installed a JDK 1.6.0_16 and Eclipse 3.5 SR1. When I started Eclipse I got that strange behaviour. I found out that the "standard" JDK was still 1.5 and so Eclipse started up with this JDK. It was pretty odd ... I later deinstalled the 1.5 to make it work, perhaps I could have changed the "standard" JDK for Windows somehow to 1.6!?
