Yes, "we should eliminate all of them" should be read "theoretically, subject to whatever realities stand  in the way." It's less than promising that there could be any complications whatsoever posed by "locally", which is in its entirety
{code}
def locally[T](x: T): T  = x 
{code}
If you can't write a macro which simply returns x.tree without creating new bugs, it is a severe deficiency in macros.
