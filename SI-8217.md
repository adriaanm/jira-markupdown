The behavior of Scalac (2.10.3) is inconsistent between objects WTF_A0 and A below: in one case an undefined type member is forbidden, in the other case it is allowed just because it is inherited.
-I speculate that forbidding abstract type members is not needed to ensure soundness, and allowing them also seems of dubious utility (but empty and distinct types are useful in Haskell in type-level programming).- 
After clarifications: undefined type members can encode existential types, so they are allowed on purpose. The handling of `WTF_A0` is a mistake.

I searched JIRA for "undefined type members" and found no relevant report. I can't find any applicable part of the spec describing the expected behavior.

```scala
//Interesting facts are noted with WTF throughout this snippet.
trait A {
  type T
}

//WTF??? We do not need to define abstract types ever?
object A extends A

//WTF? But if the declaration is not inherited, we do need to define abstract types?
object WTF_A0 {
  type T //only classes can have declared but undefined members
}

class WTF_A1 {
  type T //classes indeed can have an undefined type member. WTF?
}

object Test_WTF_A1 {
  new WTF_A1 //and we can even instantiate the class. WTF?
}
```

The behavior also seems unintentional: The code producing this warning (src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Namers.scala:Namer.validate) does not seem to be specific to type members — it is generally related to contained symbol, and there is no comment describing why undefined inherited members should be allowed while they should be forbidden if declared inline.
This is basically a duplicate of #1753.

Previous discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-user/MiKsvizQBd4
#1753 is related and instructive, but incomplete. It only says that
```scala
class A { type T }
```
is intentionally allowed.

But what about objects? Why is the following forbidden?

```scala
object WTF_A0 {
  type T //Error: only classes can have declared but undefined members
}
```

I don't think that objects were indeed meant to be special.

Otherwise, the following should be also forbidden:
```scala
trait A {
  type T
}
 
object A extends A
```

If this inconsistency is by design, I'd demand more explanation than this:
> I'm pretty sure it's been discussed before and it falls into the not-a-bug category.

Additionally, on the implementation level, the mere fact that the the check for undefined members is different from the check for undefined **inherited** members seem debatable — I guess the former can be done earlier, but it seems the two checks should still share logic.
Adriaan seems to agree in this pull request: https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/pull/127. I'm trying out the patch below, it does what I want, need to check for regressions. Before:
```scala
$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_51).
scala> object Foo {type A}
<console>:7: error: only classes can have declared but undefined members
       object Foo {type A}
                        ^
```

After:

```scala
$ ./qbin/scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20140131-194308-ea897b018a (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_51).

defined object Foo
```

You and your wild ambitions. Once you're properly calibrated you will see that is an unusually clear and complete specification.
Yes indeed! We fixed the spec before the compiler. I agree with the intent of the PR, but it needs some polish.
If we're going to allow abstract type members in classes, we should also allow them in objects, especially since they are already indirectly allowed by extending such a class.
