The new plugin (2.8.0 nightly) is not working at all for me.
I'm getting so many strange errors that I think I need to re-install Eclipse before proceeding further.

I notice that the nightly plugin is based on the new AspectJ-style plugin, so I guess I need a clean start.

Also, if the nightly plugin is using Scala-2.8.0, Im going to have problems. My project is mixed Eclipse + command-line Ant, and the Ant side is running off of stable Scala 2.7.3. I need to run builds in both command-line scalac-2.7.3 and in Eclipse.  I imagine that's not going to be compatible with a Scala-2.8.0 eclipse plugin.

If someone else can verify this bug and fix (or maybe I can try again on machine with a clean Eclipse/Scala-2.8.0 setup), that would help. Then the answer for users will be to work with only 2.8.0+ language/tools.
