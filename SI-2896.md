Under certain conditions scalac seems to not find constructors defined in Java classes.

For example when trying to use the NetBeans API from Scala I run into a strange problem:

```scala
import org.openide.filesystems._
import org.openide.loaders._

// if you uncomment this line compilation succeeds else you get an error:
// error: illegal cyclic reference involving object DataLoader
// error: too many arguments for constructor Object: ()java.lang.Object
// abstract class Dummy extends DataObject(null, null)

class SomeDataObject(primaryFile : FileObject, loader : MultiFileLoader) extends MultiDataObject(primaryFile, loader)

// if you uncomment this line you get
// error: org.openide.loaders.DataObject does not have a constructor
// abstract class Dummy extends DataObject(null, null)
```

I have attached this file along with the required jars to the report.
This is a duplicate of... well there are a lot of things going on with inner classes.  I'm going to say #2464.
Except that in this case we're not getting a "Broken class file" error?

I'm wondering if this might be related to #2889.
Replying to [comment:5 muhlig]:
> I forgot to mention: this file compiles fine using Scala 2.7.x but fails to compile with any 2.8 build I have tested so far (r18641 until Beta1-RC7).

Regression introduced in r18616.  (You were almost there!) That was to fix #1539, a charter member of the inner classes bug squad.
This looks fixed since at least RC1.  I can't check in a test case which depends on a couple hundred kilobytes of jars, but here is a demo.  If anyone wants to try to dredge out a reasonable sized test case you'll be doing a good deed.

```scala
[paulp@leaf 2896]$$ /scala/builds/trunk/r19003/bin/scalac -cp 'tmp/*' a.scala 
a.scala:9: error: illegal cyclic reference involving object DataLoader
class SomeDataObject(primaryFile : FileObject, loader : MultiFileLoader) extends MultiDataObject(primaryFile, loader)
                                                                                 ^
a.scala:9: error: too many arguments for constructor Object: ()java.lang.Object
class SomeDataObject(primaryFile : FileObject, loader : MultiFileLoader) extends MultiDataObject(primaryFile, loader)
                    ^
two errors found
[paulp@leaf 2896]$$ /scala/inst/rc1/bin/scalac -cp 'tmp/*' a.scala
[paulp@leaf 2896]$$
