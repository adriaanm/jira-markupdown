Based on a [this discussion|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1251/files#r1573933]  related to both https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5064 https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8125, it was suggested by Iulian that `CompilerControl.askTypeAt(pos)` would be changed so that it returns the whole chain of parents (with an opaque range position) that include the passed `pos`.

Benefits:

1) No need to create opaque range position for Trees that should really have a transparent positions. [This discussion|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1251/files#r1573933] should prove the point.

2) The solution is general enough, and will reduce code duplication, as there are several places in the IDE codebase where we need to access the parent of a Tree.
