Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19673-b20091116132603 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

 In A.scala and B.scala
```scala
trait A {
	type S[_]
}
trait B extends A {
	type F = S[Int]
}
```

 1. Compile
 1. Remove [_] or remove type S completely.
 1. Mark A.scala modified, manager only recompiles A.scala, missing compile error.
 1. Explicitly recompiling B.scala provides the expected compile error.
(In r20376) Closes #2793, #2651, #2650, #2653. Review by dragos.
There is still a problem with aliases.

Given A.scala, B.scala:
```scala
trait A {
	type S = Int
}
trait B extends A {
	def x: S
	def y: Int = x
}
```

 1. Compile
 1. Change A.scala to:
```scala
trait A {
	type S = Long
}
```
 1. Mark A.scala modified.  B.scala is not recompiled, missing compile error:
```scala
B.scala:3: error: type mismatch;
 found   : B.this.S
 required: Int
        def y: Int = x
                     ^
```
(In r20476) When comparing type aliases use info instead of tpe so that the changes are correctly detected. Fixes #2650. No review.
This might be a separate issue, but changing a type alias that is used in a method signature does not cause clients of that method to be recompiled.  This is in r20598.

Given A.scala, B.scala:

```scala
trait A {
    type T = Int
    def x: T
}
object B {
  def x(a: A): Int = a.x
}
```

 1. Compile
 1. Change A.scala to:
```scala
trait A {
    type T = Long
    def x: T
}
```
 1. Mark A.scala modified, build manager misses error by not recompiling B.scala.
 1. Recompiling B.scala gives:
```scala
B.scala:2: error: type mismatch;
 found   : a.T
 required: Int
  def x(a: A): Int = a.x
                       ^
```
(In r20724) Closes #2650. Dependency on type alias requires analysis before uncurry phase. Added tests. Review by dragos.
In both versions of A, use an intermediate type `T2`:
```scala
  type T2 = T
  def x: T2
```
and change `T` as before.  This doesn't recompile B.scala.

Using r20728.
(In r20745) Check recursively the type aliases. Closes #2650. Review by dragos.
