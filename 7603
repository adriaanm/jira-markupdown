The {{AssertionError}} occurs during the mixin phase. This can be confirmed by running
{noformat}
fsc test.scala -optimize -Ystop-after:constructors
{noformat}

multiple times, no {{AssertionError}} ensues.

In contrast, running 
{noformat}
fsc test.scala -optimize -Ystop-after:mixin
{noformat}

results in {{AssertionError}} every other time.
