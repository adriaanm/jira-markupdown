Perhaps related to scala/bug#5789. 

The `AssertionError` occurs during the mixin phase. This can be confirmed by running
```
fsc test.scala -optimize -Ystop-after:constructors
```

multiple times, no `AssertionError` ensues.

In contrast, running 
```
fsc test.scala -optimize -Ystop-after:mixin
```

results in `AssertionError` every other time.
