Change the grammar for ImportSelectors to allow a trailing comma. These will facilitate generation by tools and allow easier sorting of the values.
I vote for this too, not for code generation, but because of settings list in SBT configuration:

```
settings = Seq(
  name := 'bla',
  version := 2,
  something <<= path \{ _ / "foo" \}
)
```

Let's comment last line:

```
  settings = Seq(
  name := 'bla',
  version := 2,
  //something <<= path \{ _ / "foo" \}
}
```

Ooops, syntax error, fix:

```
settings = Seq(
  name := 'bla',
  version := 2 /*,
  something <<= path \{ _ / "foo" \} */
}
```

 - ugly and annoying

Ok, add new line:

```
settings = Seq(
  name := 'bla',
  version := 2,
  something <<= path \{ _ / "foo" \}
  another := ""
}
```

Damn, I always forget to add comma to previous line!
Trailing commas everywhere make version control diffs much happier.

```scala
.
 foo(
     one,
     two,
+    three,
 )
```

versus

```scala
.
 foo(
     one,
-    two
+    two,
+    three
 )
```
