```scala
scala> toolbox.parse("val (x: int) = 2")
res0: toolbox.u.Tree = val x: int = 2

scala> q"val (x: int) = 2"
res1: reflect.runtime.universe.ValDef =
val x: int = 2: @scala.unchecked match {
  case (x @ (_: int)) => x
}
```
Interestingly enough quasiquote's version looks much more reasonable to me.
