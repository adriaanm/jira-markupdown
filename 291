Marking the use undeclared would not solve the problem, because you could still write the following and observe this

{code}
class Foo {
  println ( this.foo )
  val foo = 1
}
{code}

It is less than ideal, but we have discussed the problem, and I am told that attempts to fix this have been made in the past, and given the limitations of the JVM, they were all worse.
