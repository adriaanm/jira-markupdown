There are several methods on List that will compile when called from Java, but fail at runtime with a NoSuchMethodError. For example:
{code:title=src/SomeScala.scala}
object SomeScala {
  def list = List(1, 2, 3) 
}
```scala
{code:title=src-java/Main.java}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(SomeScala.list().tail());
        System.out.println(SomeScala.list().par());
        System.out.println(SomeScala.list().init());
    }
}
```

All 3 of those methods will fail at runtime:
list().tail():
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.collection.immutable.List.tail()Lscala/collection/Traversable;
	at Main.main(Main.java:3)
```

list().par()
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.collection.immutable.List.par()Lscala/collection/parallel/ParIterable;
	at Main.main(Main.java:4)
```

list().init()
```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.collection.immutable.List.init()Lscala/collection/Traversable;
	at Main.main(Main.java:5)
```

The runtime type of the list is scala.collection.immutable.$colon$colon. If you were to cast it to that type, then tail() will compile and run:

{code:title=src-java/Main.java}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        scala.collection.immutable.$colon$colon colon = (scala.collection.immutable.$colon$colon) (Object) SomeScala.list();
        System.out.println(colon.tail()); //successfully prints List(2, 3)
    }
}
{code}

I found this when unit tests failed when calling tail() and tried out a few other methods to find par() and init(). I assume there are other methods that would fail like this, but I didn't see any pattern. For example, both "init()" and "inits()" show up as methods on "TraversableLike", but "inits()" works.
For most of this I used the Scala IDE (v3.0.0rc3-2_10-2013-03-131031-dac2f1c, which has scala 2.10.1). I had also replicated the problem with list.tail() on the command line, again using 2.10.1 (SomeScala.scala in src/scala, Main.java in src/java):
```
./scalac -sourcepath src/java/* src/scala/*
javac -classpath /home/dnadolny/tools/scala-2.10.1/lib/scala-library.jar:. -d . src/java/Main.java
./scala Main
```

I have also reproduced it with 2.10.0, however it works correctly under 2.9.2.
here's a complete transcript of a reproduction:
```
% cat S.scala   
object CreateCollection {
  def someList = List(1, 2, 3)
}
% cat Main.java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(CreateCollection.someList().tail());
    }
}
% /usr/local/scala-2.10.1/bin/scalac S.scala                                
% javac -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.10.1/lib/scala-library.jar Main.java
% java -classpath .:/usr/local/scala-2.10.1/lib/scala-library.jar Main      
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.collection.immutable.List.tail()Lscala/collection/Traversable;
	at Main.main(Main.java:3)
```
Paul's analysis from the mailing list:

```
The method descriptor is not the erasure of the generic signature. Surely a scala bug. Notice how the third tail's return type is Traversable<A> in the generic signature but Object in the descriptor. javac issues an ill-fated call to the method it expects to find based on generic return type Traversable<A>.

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.collection.immutable.List.tail()Lscala/collection/Traversable;
	at Main.main(Main.java:3)

scala> val tails = classOf[scala.collection.immutable.List[_]].getMethods filter (_.getName == "tail")
tails: Array[java.lang.reflect.Method] = Array(public scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized scala.collection.immutable.List.tail(), public scala.collection.immutable.List scala.collection.immutable.List.tail(), public java.lang.Object scala.collection.AbstractTraversable.tail())

scala> tails foreach println

public scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized scala.collection.immutable.List.tail()
public scala.collection.immutable.List scala.collection.immutable.List.tail()
public scala.collection.Traversable<A> scala.collection.AbstractTraversable.tail()

But as you may have heard, my scala days are numbered so all I can offer is this diagnosis.
```

I bisected that (the old fashioned way, as the regression pre dates the archive of builds available to scalac-hash), and landed https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/a0a045f5c0. That was just a library change (introduction of `Abstract{Seq, Iterable, ...}`) so the root problem is a latent bug in the backend (either with erasure or with generic signatures.), most probably #3452.

I've been poking around in this space recently to fix some problems with generic sigs and erasure of value classes, so I'll take a look at this one.  
If it's #3452, very likely it's workarounded by ~~Xverify (with a backend respecting it ~~ currently it's GenASM, it used to be GenJVM): -Xverify detected and discarded invalid generic signatures, avoiding the problem (while reducing precision of type signatures, of course).
I even had a pull request enabling that check by default.
Seen in isolation:

```scala
trait TraversableLike[Repr] {
  def tail: Repr = ???
}
trait MyTraversable[A] extends TraversableLike[Option[A]]
abstract class MyAbstractTraversable extends MyTraversable[String]

scala> classOf[MyAbstractTraversable].getMethod("tail")
res16: java.lang.reflect.Method = public java.lang.Object MyAbstractTraversable.tail()

scala> classOf[MyAbstractTraversable].getMethod("tail").toGenericString
res17: String = public scala.Option<java.lang.String> MyAbstractTraversable.tail()
```
Which is just #3452, and is fixed by the almost-there patch of Paul's https://github.com/paulp/scala/commit/c007b7dedb6e769f68dca5ec1898b4eeb616e297

```
scala> classOf[MyAbstractTraversable].getMethod("tail")
res0: java.lang.reflect.Method = public java.lang.Object MyAbstractTraversable.tail()

scala> classOf[MyAbstractTraversable].getMethod("tail").toGenericString
res1: String = public java.lang.Object MyAbstractTraversable.tail()
```

I think I finally understand Paul's assertion that "we need more bridges". Rather than making the weakening generic signature to meet the erasure to `Object` we could (should?) sharpen the erasure of `tail` to `Traversable`, in the process installing a bridge for the covariant override. Currently, bridges are only added in the erasure phase, so later phases (importantly: mixin) are restricted to generating signatures that exactly match the overriden signature.
I'm pretty sure that bridges have to be based on the Scala typesystem. Brian's JVMLS talk on the matter was really helpful to me to understand why its non-trivial to just do them in the VM (and I think the same arguments prevent us from making it a back-end only affair).

I actually got part of the way there to installing additional bridges in mixin: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/3452-rebased (please excuse the expasperated messaage-free commits at the end of the sequence!) but was lucky enough that a test (or the library) alerted me to a corner case that resulted from spreading responsibility for bridges across two phases. The root complexity is, as you point out, running mixin after erasure. Martin told me he's going to try it **way** earlier next time around, all the way back in extension methods.
