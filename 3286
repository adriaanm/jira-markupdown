(In r21135) Closes scala/bug#2940. Review by extempore. My original idea to replace existrentialAbstraction by existentialType in ClassfileParsers was correct after all. However this change triggered another landmine in Definitions, where ClassType queried unsafeTypeParams. I think that was only needed for the migration to Java generics in 2.7, so it can safely go away now. Because the change in classfile parsers forces less of a type, unsafeTtpeParams returned the wrong result, which caused the build to fail. The modifications in Erasure and Implicits were attempts to isolate the problem before. They seem to be unnecessary to make the build go through, but are cleaner than the previous versions they replace.
