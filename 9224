Yep, it was a problem in erasure.

I think this will fix it:

Checking for collateral damage:

We can't fix this for 2.10.x as changing the erased types risks binary compatibility breakages for ourselves, and downstream libraries that are themselves trying to offer binary compatibility guarantees.

If that build goes well, I'll submit a PR against master.
