Please add support for nested Java annotations. Here is my guess at what the syntax might be, using the JPA annotations for example:
{code}
import javax.persistence._

@Entity
class Test {
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable { val joinColumns = Array(@JoinColumn{val name = "a name"}) }
    var test: String = _
}
{code}
In this example, the nested annotation is in an array value, but they should also be supported as single values:
{{@MyAnnotation { val test = @MyOtherAnnotation }}}

Here is a related [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala/8768 mailing list thread]. This feature is very important for interoperating with Java libraries, and I don't know of any current workaround.
