I'm not sure, but it seems a bug:
{code}
trait F
trait Y extends F
trait G extends F
trait B extends F
class T
class O extends T
class P extends T
class A extends O with Y with B

class D extends P with G with B

object Test {
  def main(args : Array[String]) {
    val z = 1 match {
      case 1 => new A
      case _ => new D
    }
    val o: Int = z
  }
}
{code}
After compilation you'll see error message about 'z' type:
{code}
error: type mismatch;
found   : aasdf.B with aasdf.T
required: Int
val o: Int = z
{code}
As I see in compound type first is Trait and second is class, what is wrong.
I'm not sure, but I think this bug can cause problems with following linearization and right methods resolving from such wrong type.
I'm not sure what was intended here, but changing the
{code}
      val o: Int = z
{code}
to any of the following
{code}
      val o: B = z
{code}
{code}
      val o: T = z
{code}
{code}
      val o: F = z
{code}
makes it compile fine for me (in both 2.8.0 final and 2.8.1 RC1).
This is a valid bug report, but I'm closing it as a duplicate of the newer SI-3872, which has more information.
