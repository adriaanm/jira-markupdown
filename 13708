Using 2.7.2.RC1. The problem is that if {{A}} is a type variable with a {{>: Null}} lower bound, then even if {{B >: Null}}, {{A with B}} won't be {{>: Null}}.

Super-contrived minimal example follows:

{code}
scala> trait X { x => type T >: Null; new X { type T = Any with x.T } }
<console>:5: error: error overriding type T in trait X with bounds >: Null <: Any;
 type T has incompatible type Any with X.this.T
       trait X { x => type T >: Null; new X { type T = Any with x.T } }
{code}

Replace {{Null}} above with any other type, and it works.
