The error is
```scala
java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name
        at java.lang.Class.getSimpleName(Unknown Source)
```
like Ticket scala/bug#286 - getSimpleName expects a $$ between TestScalaBug$$foo$$ and foo2's class name?

Could TestScalaBug$$foo$$foo2 instead be named TestScalaBug$$foo$$$$foo2 ? I understand that this conflicts with the goal of having nice names when accessing Scala classes from Java.


The alternate approach would be to generate a TestScalaBug$$foo class, with TestScalaBug$$foo$$foo2 being an inner class of that class. But I suspect that approach may have already been considered and rejected in Ticket scala/bug#1572
