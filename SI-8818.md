FreshNameExtractor is supposed to match names that end with a number, but it also matches names that don't end with a number

The current regex {noformat}sname.matches("^.*\\d*$"){noformat} is basically equivalent to {{"^.*$"}}.

The obvious fix, turning the second {{*}} into a {{+}}, fails the {{scalacheck/quasiquotes}}, as can be seen here: https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/job/pr-scala-test/6730/console.

See here for the fix in {{assertThrows}}, it's not yet merged, but under review: https://github.com/lrytz/scala/commit/3fea08e786af8944652d1dbf853891ced4848c07
