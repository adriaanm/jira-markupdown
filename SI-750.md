Java:

```scala
public class AO {
    public static <T> void f(T[] a) {
        System.out.println(ar0);
    }
}
```

Scala:

```scala
object Main {
    def main(argv : Array[String]) : Unit = {
        val a = Array(1, 2, 3)
        AO.f(a)
    }
}
```

This tries to cast `a` to `Object[]`, which will always fail. It should give a compile-time error, since Java doesn't support polymorphic use of primitive arrays.
This is maybe better, maybe worse now: it compiles from all source, but not against the bytecode.
```scala
[paulp@leaf 750]$$ scalac AO.java a.scala 
[paulp@leaf 750]$$ scala Main
java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Object;
	at Main$$.main(a.scala:4)
	at Main.main(a.scala)
```
But:
```scala
[paulp@leaf 750]$$ javac AO.java 
[paulp@leaf 750]$$ scalac a.scala 
a.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Array[Int]
 required: Array[? with java.lang.Object]
        AO.f(a)
             ^
one error found
```
Consolidating with closely related #4216.
