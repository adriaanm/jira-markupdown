I thought this was already open somewhere but I can't find it.
{code}
scala> case class Foo[T, U](f: T => U)
defined class Foo

// uh-oh, Any => Any should be Nothing => Any.
scala> def f(x: Any) = x match { case Foo(bar) => bar }
f: (x: Any)Any => Any

scala> def f(x: Any) = x match { case Foo(bar) => bar(5) }
f: (x: Any)Any

scala> f(Foo((x: String) => x))
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String
	at $anonfun$1.apply(<console>:11)
	at .f(<console>:9)
	at .<init>(<console>:11)
{code}

Interestingly, under -Yvirtpatmat it gives an unchecked warning (no warning with regular pattern matcher) but still infers Any => Any.
{code}
scala> def f(x: Any) = x match { case Foo(bar) => bar }
<console>:9: warning: non variable type-argument Any in type Foo[Any,Any] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
       def f(x: Any) = x match { case Foo(bar) => bar }
                                      ^
f: (x: Any)Any => Any
{code}
Issues remain.

1) As detailed in email to scala-internals, the fix was overly specific and missed numerous unsound cases.

2) I also found that the current fix only works on explicitly declared types. For instance in t5189b.scala, if I let the return type be inferred:
{code}
def unwrap[T](x: AbsWrapperCov[T])/*: Wrapped[T]*/ = x match {
  case Wrapper/*[_ <: T ]*/(wrapped) => wrapped
}
{code}
Then it compiles - and infers Wrapped[T], unsoundly. I assume this is pt=WildcardType never coming to grips with the situation.

I believe the soundness issue requires an invariant something like: if the type of a GADT method (inferred or otherwise) uses the method's type parameters as type arguments, then either the corresponding class type parameters must be covariant, or the usages must be upper-bounded by the type parameter rather than the type parameter itself. Similar for contravariant/lower.

That doesn't address the type inference question - it has to infer Wrapped[_ <: T] rather than Wrapped[T] in the above example, and I'm not sure what that will take.

I also have serious doubts about the mitigation strategy taken with the original patch, i.e. adding a bunch of casts. Those casts look pretty unsafe, is there reason to believe otherwise?
Funny that I didn't immediately see the connection to SI-6925. (I discovered these through completely independent paths.) The funny thing is that in this one I'm pointing out that inferring Wrapped[T] is unsound and it has to infer Wrapped[_ <: T], and in SI-6925 we're calling the inference of Set[_ <: T] instead of Set[T] a regression. But maybe it can infer Set[T] on the invariant type? It's the covariant case for which it must only assume a bound, not a type.

My email to scala-internals was: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/dGQCGQ8dYNs/discussion

Here is a more direct demonstration.
{code}
scala> abstract class Covariant[+A](x: A) { def apply(): A = x }
defined class Covariant

scala> case class Invariant[A](val xs: Array[A]) extends Covariant[A](xs.head)
defined class Invariant

scala> def f[A](value: Covariant[A]) = value match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
f: [A](value: Covariant[A])Array[A]

scala> f(Invariant(Array[Int](1)): Covariant[Any])
java.lang.ClassCastException: [I cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.Object;
	at .<init>(<console>:12)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:11)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at $print(<console>)
{code}

And for backward compat to 2.7, here are 5 lines which incur an ArrayStoreException on any version of scala.
{code}
trait Covariant[+A]
val arr = Array("abc")
case class Invariant[A](xs: Array[A]) extends Covariant[A]
def f[A](v: Covariant[A]) = v match { case Invariant(xs) => xs }
f(Invariant(arr): Covariant[Any])(0) = Nil
{code}

See further elaboration in SI-6944.
