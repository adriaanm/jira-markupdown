I was unable to find anything in Aladdin about this.  If having subtyping behave correctly means that we lose type soundness, something is seriously wrong with the type system.  This with the fact that fixing SI-1208 would apparently break all sorts of things seems to indicate that we need to step back and really figure out what has gone wrong with the Scala type system before proceeding with additional features.
