I'm very exited with scala and I'm eager to use it more. I understand your emotions, but still I don't feel this is a blocker issue.

How does this issue really affect integration with java?

I only noticed a problem in eclipse auto completion, the eclipse java compiler is happy otherwise, javac too; are there other issues?

Instead of moving to the head build of the scala compiler, please consider using my jar postprocessing tool at:
