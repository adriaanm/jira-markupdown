=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
   build scaladoc on this file:

/**
 * <p>
 * Application that runs a suite of tests.
 * The application accepts command line arguments that specify optional <em>config map</em> (key-value pairs), an optional 
 * <em>runpath</em>, zero to many <code>Reporter</code>s, optional lists of tags to include and/or exclude, zero to many
 * <code>Suite</code> class names, zero to many "members-only" <code>Suite</code> paths, zero to many "wildcard" <code>Suite</code> paths,
 * and zero to many TestNG XML config file paths.
 * All of these arguments are described in more detail below. Here's a summary:
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A runpath is the list of filenames, directory paths, and/or URLs that <code>Runner</code>
 * uses to load classes for the running test. If runpath is specified, <code>Runner</code> creates
 * a custom class loader to load classes available on the runpath.
 * The graphical user interface reloads the test classes anew for each run
 * by creating and using a new instance of the custom class loader for each run.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Application that runs a suite of tests. The application accepts command line arguments that specify optional <em>config map</em> (key-value pairs), an optional <em>runpath</em>, zero to many Reporters, optional lists of tags to include and/or exclude, zero to many <code>Suite</code> class names, zero to many "members-only" <code>Suite</code> paths, zero to many "wildcard" <code>Suite</code> paths, and zero to many TestNG XML config file paths. All of these arguments are described in more detail below. 

A runpath is the list of filenames, directory paths, and/or URLs that Runner uses to load classes for the running test. If runpath is specified, <code>Runner<code> creates a custom class loader to load classes available on the runpath. The graphical user interface reloads the test classes anew for each run by creating and using a new instance of the custom class loader for each run. The classes that comprise the test may also be made available on the classpath, in which case no runpath need be specified.

I just saw a previous Ticket on this same problem: Ticket #3735 Scaladoc should add spaces between lines. 
as indicated, duplicate of #3735
(In r24406) Modify BufferedSource to use a BufferedLineIterator to speed up line-by-line reads on large files. Updated testfile which used this class. Closes #4186. Review (of fft.check) by prokopec.
Oops, r24406 fixes #4168 not this bug.
