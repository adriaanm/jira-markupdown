class Contra[-T]
trait A
trait B extends A
trait C extends B
def contraLBUB[a >: C <: A](): Contra[a] = null
def contraLB[a >: C](): Contra[a] = null
contraLBUB() //inferred Contra[C] instead of Contra[A]
contraLB() //inferred Contra[C] instead of Contra[Any]
{code}

According to Language specification (6.26.4 Case 2):
If several substitutions exist,
local-type inference will choose for each type variable ai a minimal or maximal type
Ti of the solution space. A maximal type Ti will be chosen if the type parameter ai
appears contravariantly (ยง4.5) in the type T of the expression. A minimal type Ti
will be chosen in all other situations, i.e. if the variable appears covariantly, nonvariantly
or not at all in the type T.

What we can see here. Value has Type Contra[a]. So position of a is contravariant. There is no covariant or invariant positions of a => maximal solution should be chosen.
Actually, it works as expected as a Value (Case 2)

{code}
scala> contraLBUB
res9: Contra[A] = null

scala> contraLB
res10: Contra[Any] = null
{code}

So the question is, does "Case 3: Methods" explain these?

{code}
scala> contraLBUB()
res11: Contra[C] = null

scala> contraLB()
res12: Contra[C] = null
{code}

I'm sure this is wrong if it's different:
{code}
foo
foo()
{code}
Yeah, that's a bit hard to defend:
{noformat}

scala> contraLBUB
res1: Contra[A] = null

scala> contraLBUB()
res2: Contra[C] = null

scala> (contraLBUB _)()
res3: Contra[A] = null
{noformat}
Without having checked the consequences (sky falling, etc), but this is enough to restore consistency between inference for the value and method application:

This is being reverted for causing SI-6311.
Fixing this means that {{Coll}} would be inferred differently for these two signatures, which look instead equivalent:

{code}
def f[T, Coll <: Traversable[T]](p0: String)(p1: Traversable[T]): (Coll => Traversable[T]) = ??? //Here Coll would be maximized.
def f[T, Coll <: Traversable[T]](p0: String)(p1: Traversable[T])(p2: Coll): Traversable[T] = ??? //Here Coll would be minimized.
{code}

This is if I get the new expected behavior right, which says that (ignoring mixed variance) a type argument must be minimized (made most specific) if it appears either:
(a) _covariantly_ in the result type (per 4881), hence _covariantly_ in the method type or
(b) _covariantly_ in argument types, hence _contravariantly_ in the method type.
