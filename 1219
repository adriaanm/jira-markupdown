To see the difference in pattern matching due to the lack of outer pointer, check out what the following snippet looks like at phase cleanup:
{code}
class D {
  val c1 = new C
  val c2 = new C
  val fn1 = new c1.FinalNested
  val fn2 = new c2.FinalNested
  val n1 = new c1.FinalNested
  val n2 = new c2.FinalNested

  (n1: Any) match { case x: c2.FinalNested => x}
  (fn1: Any) match { case x: c2.Nested => x}
}
{code}
