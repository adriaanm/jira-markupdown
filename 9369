Hi Paul,
Thank you very much for your clarification. I should have explained it as background.

To compile against Android 4.1 and deploy against Android 4.0, is the recommended way to use new features only in newer Android 4.1 devices with keeping compatibility with older Android devices such as Android 4.0 in an application. It must be compatible as long as the features aren't used in older Android devices such as 4.0. SQLiteDatabase.close() method is NOT newly added but exisiting from the first publich Android version 1.5 .

That's why there are two types of setting in SDK version in Android Project, targetSDKversion and minSDKversion.
- TargetSDKversion is an Android SDK library version to compile against, which is Android 4.1 in this case. 
- MinSDKversion is a minimun Android version to run the application, which is Android 4.0 or below in this case.

Please find below link about why targetSDKversion often differs from minSDKversion.

I'm not inisiting to say this is a bug in Scala, but I just really want to understand why this compiler behavior change happens and how to avoid this in a practical way.

If you have any questions, please feel free to let me know. 

Elarboration by anyone is welcome.
Thanks in advance.
