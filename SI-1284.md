The following does not typecheck:
{code}
scala> val f : (Int => T) forSome { type T <: Ordered[T] } = (x:Int) => x * x
<console>:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Int) => Int
 required: Function1[Int, _ <: Ordered[T]]
       val f : (Int => T) forSome { type T <: Ordered[T] } = (x:Int) => x * x
{code}
The problem is probably that the existential is being pushed inside the function type, but I am not certain.
