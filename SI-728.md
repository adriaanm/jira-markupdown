I have "Cp1251" default encoding set for Eclipse (v.3.3.1.1) workspace 
and "UTF-8" for Scala project.  Nevertheless the project is building 
with "Cp1251" encoding rather "UTF-8" one. The simples way to check the 
issue is to println("something-localized"). Of course I have tried 
building and running such 'println' from command line also and with 
different cases of encoding, and tried different combinations of 
workspace and project encodings also.

The issue takes place for current SVN state for both the language and 
the plugin (r14512).
I have noticed another encoding-related info. Terminal output has fragment shown below. Here YYY.scala is definitely UTF-8 file with some "Cp1251-forbidden" Array[Char] literals. As a result, projects can not be build at all.


{code}
...
build XXX.scala
IO error while decoding /.../YYY.scala with windows-1251
Please try specifying another one using the -encoding option
build ZZZ.scala
...
{code}

And again some additional info. I have found this method in scala.tools.eclipse.BuildCompiler:

{code}
  // use workspace specified encoding for each file. 
  override def getSourceFile(f: AbstractFile): SourceFile = {
    // new BatchSourceFile(f, reader.read(f))
    val g = f match {
    case f : PlainFile => f
    case f => return super.getSourceFile(f)
    }
    val root = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace.getRoot
    val path = Path.fromOSString(g.file.getAbsolutePath)
    val file = root.getFile(path)
    val reader = readers(file.getCharset)
    new BatchSourceFile(f, reader.read(f))
  }

{code}

Let's look at first line, commenting something interesting for the bug :-) OK, I have tried to insert 'println's for debugging - indeed *all* files are read with workspace (rather project) encoding ('case f : PlainFile' takes place).
With "try-and-see method" I have found a way to partially resolve the issue. With replacing


{code}
    val reader = readers(file.getCharset)
{code}

with


{code}
    val reader = readers(project.underlying.getDefaultCharset)
{code}

in the method shown above we get first step to resolve the issue. Next (and last) step is to get IFile which is appropriate to 'g' or 'file' in terms of the method, and use iFile.getDefaultCharset instead of iProject.getDefaultCharset. Being absolutely zero in PDE (and having night transformed to early morning :) ) I have not found a way to get IFile yet.




OK, such reader works for me completely: the all eclipse charset settings hierarchy (workspace - project - file) works at my case:

{code}
    val charSet = project.underlying.getFile(path.lastSegment).getCharset
    val reader = readers(charSet)

{code}
