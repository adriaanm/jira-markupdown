In akka-stream we use reactive-stream Publisher and Subscriber interfaces, which are implemented in Java. At several places we had to add uncheckedVariance annotation. A suggestion by @retronym was to define those in a type alias instead.

It turns out that the type alias is expanded and the uncheckedVariance annotation is not used.

Discussion and example that illustrates the problem can be found here: https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/15643

[edit] Reproducing the example here:

Indeed, variance validation seems to dealias, which thwarts the attempt to indirect through an unchecked alias.

```scala
scala> trait F1[/* - */T, /* + */ R]; import scala.annotation.unchecked._; type VariantF1[-T, +R] = F1[T @uncheckedVariance, R @uncheckedVariance]
defined trait F1
import scala.annotation.unchecked._
defined type alias VariantF1

scala> trait C[+T] { def foo: VariantF1[Any, T] }
<console>:27: error: covariant type T occurs in invariant position in type => VariantF1[Any,T] of method foo
       trait C[+T] { def foo: VariantF1[Any, T] }
                         ^
```

Contrast with:

```scala
scala> trait F1[/* - */T, /* + */ R]; import scala.annotation.unchecked._; trait VariantF1[-T, +R] extends F1[T @uncheckedVariance, R @uncheckedVariance]
defined trait F1
import scala.annotation.unchecked._
defined trait VariantF1

scala> trait C[+T] { def foo: VariantF1[Any, T] }
defined trait C
Or:

scala> trait F1[/* - */T, /* + */ R]; import scala.annotation.unchecked._; trait O { type VariantF1[-T, +R] <: F1[T @uncheckedVariance, R @uncheckedVariance]}; object O extends O
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
defined trait F1
import scala.annotation.unchecked._
defined trait O
defined object O

scala> trait C[+T] { def foo: O.VariantF1[Any, T] }
defined trait C
```

I'm not sure whether or not subclassing or using a upper bounded type declaration would work for your use case.


Duplicate of #8079. Everyone is aware there are a couple thousand open tickets, right? On a purely statistical basis you have to figure that whatever it is you've encountered, there's a good chance some idiot has already gone to all the trouble of isolating and reporting it.
Maybe the progression of #8079 has led to overspecification, but the problem being reported - @uncheckedVariance on a type alias to a java-defined type - is exactly the same.
Also, the given example works in policy, where I have applied my patch from #8079 but made no other relevant changes.
See also my last comment in #8071, six months ago.
You've convinced me, this is a duplicate.

I'll broaden the scope of #8079 to answer the question: do we need to variance validate type aliases RHS **both** at definition and usage sites to preserve soundness, or is this behaviour a quirk of history.
