I have the Java-class-without-a-constructor error on a public Java class that has a public constructor. I moved from the latest production (non 2.8) plugin to the nightly plugin based on ticket 1840. But that didn't help.

This code in object RPTestScala

    package com.foo.bar.rpbeantest
    import _root_.com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager;
    ....
    val manager = new RPManager()

Has this errror on the final line

    com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager does not have a constructor

but other classes are constructible

    val request = new RPRequest()

--------

Disassembly of the Java jar shows:

$$ javap -classpath ~/Desktop/rpbean/lib/rpbean.jar com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager | grep RPMan
Compiled from "RPManager.java"
public class com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager extends java.lang.Object implements java.io.Serializable{
    static java.lang.Class class$$com$$epiphany$$rpbean$$RPManager;
    public com.epiphany.rpbean.RPManager();
