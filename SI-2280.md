I have a project with a lot of files, many of which depend on each other.

If I make a minor change to a file - one that does not change the interface used by any other files, the eclipse plugin still seems to rebuild my entire project, taking a long time.
Ok. I'm now running from the command line and seeing the messages. I have a large project and it seems that **every** edit I make recompiles the entire project - even something is minor as adding an extra space into a string.

What algorithm is this code supposed to be using. If the code is just tracking import dependencies between files and recompiling every file that transitively imports the changed file, then it is probably doing the right thing. 

However in most cases a full transitive recompile shouldn't be necessary as most changes will not change the interface exposed by either themselves, or other files they depend on.


I'll try to create a really simple example...
Ok. Here is a minimal test case.
We have the following three files:

A.scala:
package com.intel.test
object A {
	def foo : Int = B.foo
}

B.scala:
package com.intel.test
object B {
	def foo : Int = C.foo
}

package com.intel.test
object C {
	def foo : Int = 4 
}
 

If I add an extra bit of whitespace to C, and save it, the eclipse plugin recompiles C, B, and A. It seems that it is following the transitive import relation, rather than looking to see if an interface has changed, requiring a recompile.

In this case, perhaps the compiler could observe that the change to C had not changed the interface relative to the previously compiled version, and thus that B did not need to be recompiled. Similarly, if B was recompiled, it could observe that the new compiled file had the same interface as the old compiled file, and to A did not need to be recompiled.


In the mean time, I'm thinking I may just revert to using dynamic string-based binding to avoid my files having to import each other - but that's an ugly hack.

Is this likely to get fixed soon? 
This one is really holding me up.

Thanks

Are you /sure/ this is fixed? I just installed the nightly build for today and the problem is still there - even for the text example I gave above. In fact I think it may have got worse. 

When I add some whitespace to C, I get the following recompile messages on the console:

compiling Set(/home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/A.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/Hello.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/Maps.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/C.scala, /home/rob/workspace/Scala Test Project/src/com/intel/test/B.scala)

Maps and Hello aren't even connected to the test files. These are files from a completely different test I was doing for other features - there are no import links in either direction between these files and A/B/C.


According to Eclipse, I have the following installed:
     Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r19542-b20091112040618


Are there any known work around? Why does nobody else seem to be having problems with building projects in Scala?

Ok. I've managed to isolate the problem that was causing my project to completely re-build every time I changed a file, even after the A/B/C bug was fixed.

My Scala project was depending on classes from a previous Java project, and was importing several classes from that java project. When I removed these dependencies, the build started working properly.

To make the A/B/C example build the whole project even for whitespace changes, do the following:
- Go to "properties" for the project
- Go to the "Build path/Libraries" tab
- Click "add external class folder"
- Add whatever external java path you like
- Watch your build process slow to a crawl


I guess this explains why other people weren't seeing this bug. It only strikes you if you try to use classes from a Java project - which probably not many people do.

For reference #2882 provides a simple test case for compiling with java sources. Currently ( r20623 ) produces java.lang.Error which makes it even more scary. 
As far as I can tell #2882 is fixed, so in the absence of further info I'm going to close this as fixed as well.
