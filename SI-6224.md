There are several classes in scala.collection.immutable which are clearly implementation classes that should not be publicly accessible. Those include:

scala.collection.immutable.HashSet
  HashSet1  
  HashTrieSet

scala.collection.immutable.HashMap
  HashMap1  
  HashTrieMap

HashMap and HashSet should also be a sealed trait or at least have a private[immutable] constructor to prevent people from inheriting from these classes, since doing so makes no sense.

HashTrieMap is not even self-contained, but depends on its position in the hierarchy for the level. If you take a HashTrieSet from deep in a large tree and try to use it as a standalone HashSet, all hell will break loose, because the level (assumed 0 for a top-level HashTrieSet) will be inconsistent with the sorting of the entries.

In several places inside the algorithms it is assumed that a HashSet can be either a HashSet1, HashSetCollision1, HashTrieSet or empty. So making this a sealed trait would be optimal.
The public constructors of the classes mentioned in the SI can be used to generate internally inconsistent HashSet instances. That alone is a pretty good case for why they should be private:

{code}
HashSet1:

scala> val s = new HashSet.HashSet1("x",1)
s: scala.collection.immutable.HashSet.HashSet1[java.lang.String] = Set(x)

scala> s.contains("x")
res12: Boolean = false

HashTrieSet:

scala> val s = new HashSet.HashTrieSet(2, Array(HashSet(1), HashSet(2)), 2)
s: scala.collection.immutable.HashSet.HashTrieSet[Int] = Set(1, 2)

scala> for(e<-s) println(s.contains(e))
false
false

HashMap1:

scala> val m = new HashMap.HashMap1("x", 0, "a", null)
m: scala.collection.immutable.HashMap.HashMap1[java.lang.String,java.lang.String] = Map(x -> a)

scala> m.get("x")
res17: Option[java.lang.String] = None

HashTrieMap:

scala> val m = new HashMap.HashTrieMap[String, String](2,Array(HashMap("a"->"b"), HashMap("c"->"d")),2)
m: scala.collection.immutable.HashMap.HashTrieMap[String,String] = Map(a -> b, c -> d)

scala> for(k<-m.keys) println(m.get(k))
None
None
{code}
