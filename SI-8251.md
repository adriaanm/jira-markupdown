scala> val buf = scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int](1, 2)
buf: scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer[Int] = ListBuffer(1, 2)

scala> def f(): List[Int] = buf.readOnly

scala> val innocent = f()
innocent: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> buf ++= (1 to 100)
res4: buf.type = ListBuffer(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100)

scala> innocent

This was discussed long ago there:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/g_-gIWgB8Os/kWazrALbLKEJ

The summary of discussion:

martin> Is it used somewhere in the standard library? I agree that if possible we should deprecate it.
martin> As far as I can tell, the intent was that it provides a view. So, the implementation
  def readOnly = this
Is perfectly fine.
