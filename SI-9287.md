Look at the attached screenshot, there is a menu at the top, which probably should be at the side. Also, this top menu disappears when one scrolls, it should always stay at the side.

Tested with both Firefox and Chromium.
-probably can be closed as the layout has completely changed?-

oops, was looking at the wrong part of the docs
