I realize that.  I am sure.

> I thought "(default: vars)" means that "-g" is synonymous with "-g:vars".

It is, both of which are synonymous with not giving a -g option.  I'm not saying this is how it should be, but this is how it is and always has been.  Compile something with no options, any version of scala, and in javap you will see a LocalVariableTable, and that's what "vars" is.


Ah, I see. OK, I concur. (and if you decide to close as wontfix, I'd be fine with that too now, actually)

Also, I see now I was mistaken about the behavior of javac —�I think I have had this wrong in my head for 10 years. if you don't pass -g at all to javac, "By default, only line number and source file information is generated." Passing -g by itself gives you everything, which is more than the default; to get no debugging info at all, you must say -g:none. "It isn't a no-op in javac" is actually correct, but not for the reason I thought.
