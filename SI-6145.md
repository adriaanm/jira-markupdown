This code works for Scala 2.10.0-M2, causes warning for 2.10.0-M3, and does not work for 2.10.0-M4, 2.10.0-M5, 2.10.0-M6, and 2.10.0-M7
```scala
  private val ParentPackagePattern = """^(?:(.*)\.|)\w+$"""r

  @annotation.tailrec
  final def searchClass(packageName: String,
                        className: String): Class[_] = {
    packageName match {
      case null | "" =>
        Class.forName(className)
      case ParentPackagePattern(parentPackageName) =>
        try {
          return Class.forName(packageName + "." + className)
        } catch {
          case e: ClassNotFoundException =>
        }
        searchClass(parentPackageName, className)
      case _ =>
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad package name: " + packageName)
    }
  }
```
```scala
object Test {
  // the existential causes a cast and the cast makes searchClass not be in tail position
  // can we get rid of the useless cast?
  @annotation.tailrec
  final def searchClass: Class[_] = {
    "packageName" match {
      case _ =>
        searchClass
    }
  }
}
```
there were two problems with the original test: one was fixed (the existential type that made a tail position into a non-tail position), the other is not a regression: the try/catch with the return was never supported by tailcalls. Here's a simpler (yet isomorphic) test case that does not work on 2.9 nor 2.10:

```scala
 @annotation.tailrec
 final def searchClass: String = {
   "x" match {
     case null =>
       try {
         ""
       } catch {
         case e: ClassNotFoundException =>
          searchClass
       }
   }
 }
```
The try/catch issue is also a regression. I open another ticket here: #6479
