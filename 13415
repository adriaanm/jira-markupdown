Last line of scala launcher shell script is something like

{code}
java -classpath ... scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner "$$@"
{code}

It should be

{code}
exec java -classpath ... scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner "$$@"
{code}

To make possible finding process id of just launched scala application.

{code}
scala HelloWorld &
echo $$!
{code}

Prints PID of !HelloWorld application iff scala shell script does exec.
