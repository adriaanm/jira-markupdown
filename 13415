Last line of scala launcher shell script is something like
```scala
java -classpath ... scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner "$$@"
```

It should be
```scala
exec java -classpath ... scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner "$$@"
```

To make possible finding process id of just launched scala application.
```scala
scala HelloWorld &
echo $$!
```

Prints PID of !HelloWorld application iff scala shell script does exec.
