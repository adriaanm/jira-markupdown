This one was fixed a few days back in cb37548ef85d471951867b9f8a97cb9b9820fc66. While peforming some housework in Uncurry, I found that we weren't substituting symbols in `ClassInfoType#parents`. I included a test case in that commit that showed the same bug in extension methods (with partial functions).

I've submitted your test case: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3195
