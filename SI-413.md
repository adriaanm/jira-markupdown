The following code seems to put the compiler in an infinite loop:

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.{HashMap,MultiMap};

class C {
    val pairs = new HashMap[Int, Set[Int]] with MultiMap[Int, Int];
}
{code}

If import {{scala.collection.mutable.Set}} it compiles fine:

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.{HashMap,MultiMap,Set};

class C {
    val pairs = new HashMap[Int, Set[Int]] with MultiMap[Int, Int];
}
{code}

{code}
$$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.6.1-final -- (c) 2002-2007 LAMP/EPFL
{code}
It looks like this in an interaction between computing the closure and glb.
glb computes a type which when its closure is computed demands a more complicated glb. Not sure yet how to best solve this.

This no longer loops, now reports an error:

{code}
a.scala:4: error: illegal inheritance;
 template $$anon inherits different type instances of trait Map:
scala.collection.mutable.Map[Int,scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int]] and scala.collection.mutable.Map[Int,Set[Int]]
    val pairs = new HashMap[Int, Set[Int]] with MultiMap[Int, Int];
                ^
{code}
Still stuck in 2.7.2, but fixed in Trunk.
