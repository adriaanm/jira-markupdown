`-Yreport-scope-cascade` or some catchier option could request the suppressed errors, for those really painful builds where "try again after fixing Foo" would make you smash your monitor.

And `error: not found: abracandelabra: Did you mean abracadabra?` wouldn't hurt, so long as we're already bailing with errors and can afford to spell check the remaining 49.

49 might be the new 42.
