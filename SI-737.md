Since 2.7.0, Windows {{.bat}} files have started to appear in the {{bin}} directory of the Unix distribution (the {{.tar}} archives). They serve no purpose, and they pollute the path with unnecessary entries (they are marked as executable).
`.bat` files are included for Cygwin users. We can easily retract that 2.7.0 change if many "Unix" users consider it as a bad idea.
