The following method causes an erroneous compiler error:

```scala
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    val in = args flatMap { x => x } toStream
    println("Result = " + parse(in))
  }
```

The error is as follows (file name elided):

```scala
  ... error: block must end in result expression, not in definition
  }
```

Adding a newline between the "val" line and "println" causes the error to vanish.
Known limitation with postfix notation. The parser cannot decide whether toStream takes arguments or not and favors longer matches. What actually baffles me is that this works:

```scala
scala> List(1,2,3) tail 1
res14: Int = 3
```

Seems like an apply sneeks into this somehow.
