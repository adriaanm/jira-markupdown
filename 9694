pretty much any thread dump I grab shows the compiler spending its time in this line of ReachingDefinitions.scala:

{noformat}
      (rd filter { case (l, _, _) => l != tmp }) + ((tmp, b, idx))
{noformat}

so this may date back to https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/28f747a2c133e2dea1ab699715517ad250f65fef
