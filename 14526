When overloading a method with a curried version, the compiler is unable to distinguish, even thought a curried version *requires* a trailing underscore.

def foo(b: Bar) {
  // do something
}

def foo(b: Bar) (f: (Bar) => Baz) {
  // do something else
}

Calling:

foo(bar)

causes the compiler to issue an ambiguity error. But had I wanted the curried version, I would (in fact, I'm required to) write:

foo(bar) _
