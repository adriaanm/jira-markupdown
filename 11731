Probably you want to ask on the ML, where there are more brains listening, and where the chat doesn't corrupt the JIRA stream, which is already polluted by trivial edits etc. In fact, maybe ask on scala-language. I can say c is chosen simply because C conforms to P but not vice-versa.

Usually, if C adds something that P doesn't have, even if I'm shopping for a P, if I see a C, I go, hey, that might be useful, and it's the same price! Then I buy the C.

I think that is how Apple sells iPhones, where
```
typeOf[iPhone6] <:< typeOf[iPhone5]
```
except for the part about price.
