Example 9.3.1 has
"val x = new _root_b.B"
"Here, the reference _root_b.B"

In each case, _root_b needs to be _root_.b


May I also suggest that the corrected example be added to the compiler test suite.

With a fairly recent nightly build, I receive a compilation error:-

{code}
$$ scalac Example931.scala
Example931.scala:6: error: value b is not a member of package <root>
    val x = new _root_.b.B
                       ^
one error found

$$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.6.1.13746.20080121-080029 -- (c) 2002-2008 LAMP/EPFL
{code}

fixed in r13833.
