There's a `Regex.quoteReplacement` in the standard library, but no `Regex.quote`. Given that quoting regex metacharacters is a common operation, I think it's a bit ugly that one has to drop down to the Java API every time.
I haven't submitted this PR yet, but what do you think of:

https://github.com/som-snytt/scala/blob/a2e243369c18a5c1991dfff59644d710fa6395b5/src/library/scala/util/matching/Regex.scala#L467

`"a*b".r.quoted` with the additional use case `r"a*b".quoted` for the regex interpolator.

Open question how to compose quoted parts; I haven't looked at it, but it must be nicely done somewhere.  E.g., {code}(a\*b)*{code} is {code}s"(${Pattern quote "a*b"})*".r{code}, is there a nicer way.


Complementary, not competing:

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3343

It allows for instance:
```scala
    val q = "[]".r.quoted
    val r = s"Array$q".r
```
