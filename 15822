Calls to TreeMap.from, TreeMap.to, TreeMap.range run in time O(n) with respect of number of the items in the returned subtree. 

Valuable comment from Nathan Bronson, I got on the scala-user discussion list:

"The underlying RedBlack's range implementation is O(log n), but
TreeMap.rangeImpl then immediately calls RedBlack.count on the subrange, which is O(n).  Perhaps RedBlack.NonEmpty.count should be a val instead of a def?"

Expected behaviour: the time should be O(log n) with respect to the number of all items in the tree. 

Reproducibility: always. 

How to reproduce: Create a large TreeMap and call one of the mentioned methods, to return a large portion of the tree. 

What versions of the following are you using?
