The anchor point is meant to only solve SI-8518. In that case the problem is that we suffer from floating point inaccuracies each time we pick a new start and end point, so take() and drop() end up silly.

After struggling with binary compatibility a bit longer, I'm of the opinion as well to submit it against 2.12. But how do I do that? Is it on a separate branch, or do I tell test.bc somehow which version to test against?

Sorry for polluting your ticket. Let me know if I should take my questions elsewhere. Thanks!
