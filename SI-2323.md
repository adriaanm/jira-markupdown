Small ant test project to reproduce the error is attached. 
Steps:

1. SCALA_HOME environment var is supposed to be set

2. Inside a project dir:

ant clean compile

3. Edit src/B.scala - say, add empty line

4. Now compile only:

ant compile

5. java.lang.RuntimeException: malformed Scala signature of A at 639
To be sure the problem is not ant-related (I remember 2320 :-)), I have reproduced the error after replacing ant script with tiny bash scripts (will attach myth9.zip). Steps are in fact the same:

1. ./recompile
2. add empty string to src/B.scala
3. ./compileB

Gilles, i think this one is for you, it has to do with refinement types.

when compiling the following
{code}
trait T

object C { val c = List(1).map(e => new T{}) }

object A { val a = C.c }
{code}

the type of C.c is the refinement {{Object with T}}. The typeSymbol of the !RefinedType (the refinement class symbol) has as owner {{value $$anonfun}}, which in turn
has owner {{value c}} (debug {{case RefinedType}} in the {{putType}} method of the pickler).

Un-Pickling fails because in {{value c}} no member called {{$$anonfun}} can be found.


If you specify the type of c manually, i.e.
{code}
object C { val c: List[Object with T] = List(1).map(e => new T{}) }
{code}
the owner of the refinement symbol is {{object C}}, and everything works fine.


So the question is: what should be the owner of the refinement-class-symbol in the first case?

(In r19670) Fixed SI-2323; made Pickler do the right thing.

In retrospect, I would argue we should not have those problematic owner chains at all.

SBT's incremental compilation scheme is foiled by the shape of owner chains depending on whether a symbol's info was pickled and then unpickled or if it was obtained directly by type checking source code. We can make SBT insensitive to these changes in the case of refinements, but as a general principle, it should hold that `unpickle(pickle(typecheck) == typecheck`. See SI-6596.
I'm going to revert r19670 (https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6063bf3d78 and https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/44e60b3ae6) in master as I cannot reproduce the failure after having replaced localizedOwner by the identity. It seems this workaround is no longer needed.

There's no test in the suite for this, so I compiled the following:
{code}
trait T
trait U

object C { val c = List(1).map(e => (e, new T with U { def x: this.type = ???})) }

object A { val a = C.c }
{code}

and then accessed `A.a` in the repl -- everything works fine.

I'll first try to find out how this works now exactly. After reverting, I see the same RefinedType being created in SI-6596 whether unpickling or typing directly.
