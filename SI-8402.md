It's hard to know how many more places -Xsource 2.10 might need to be respected for what I want to work, because compilation tends to halt before one has a clear picture. But there are at least the two shown here. First:
```scala
class Foo[+CC[X]] { type Coll = CC[_] }
```
That compiles in 2.10 but not in 2.11.

"What I want to work" is to be able to compile the 2.10 sources with 2.11. For y'all to push through the errors seems like an easy way to find some of the holes in -Xsource.

The other place, which arises first:
```scala
/l/trunk1/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/icode/Printers.scala:19: error: reference to Linearizer is ambiguous;
it is both defined in trait Linearizers and imported subsequently by
import global.icodes._
  class TextPrinter(writer: PrintWriter, lin: Linearizer) {
                                              ^
one error found
onExit 1
```
It only became possible to even try this after 0fbd4422b2 which fixed "scala.reflect.internal.FatalError: class Universe does not have a member Quasiquote", thanks for that.

In case you want to pursue this I made a script to embody what I think should work, which might even serve as the basis of a test.
```scala
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Run one version of scala compiling against a different one.
#
# Sample usage:
# find /path/to/scala-2.10/src/{asm,library,reflect,compiler} -name '*.scala' -o -name '*.java' | egrep -v '/ant/') | \
#   runner.sh -verbose

runlib=/scala/trunk/build/pack/lib
otherlib=/scala/inst/210/lib

java -Xmx2g \
  -cp "$runlib"/'*' scala.tools.nsc.Main \
  -cp "$otherlib"/'*' \
  -Xsource:2.10 \
  "$@"
```
I did notice some issues have already been flushed out, e.g. this doesn't compile without the -Xsource:2.10 because of the implicit conversion of Null.
```scala
% pscalac -Xsource:2.10 /l/trunk1/src/library/scala/Option.scala
```
I think the first part of the request dups #8265.

BTW, [~garillot] has a jenkins job that typechecks a few projects with  `-Xsource:2.10`. https://jenkins.scala-ide.org:8496/jenkins/view/Scala%20Xsource%20flag%20nightlies/

We know that we don't have the resources to be completely bug-compatible with 2.10 under this flag, so we are relying on the data from these builds to figure out where we get the most bang for our buck.

The primary use case for this flag is to use the 2.11 IDE for 2.10 code bases.
Yes I figured some of this would exist in other tickets. Well if it helps rest assured that #8265 will hit many projects. The convenience of invisible unsoundness has an accidental allure like few others.
After I patch past the variance issue there is only one more issue before compilation succeeds. To me that says it's easily worth making this work and testing it.

The last problem is a change in the scala.runtime support java classes, introduced in 265fc6b230 . Now it generates calls to "create" which doesn't exist in the 2.10 sources.

```

```

It's relatively easy to work around by substituting the 2.11 scala/runtime/*.java classes for the 2.10 ones.
I've lodged the ambiguity error as #8403. Looks like its a regression after my refactoring of Contexts.
