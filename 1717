I agree about test cases.  The problem in scala/bug#1240 is that the bug is only induced if the files are compiled sequentially, and I couldn't see how to make partest first compile a java file, then compile a scala file without looking at the java source, and then attempt to run a program and verify the output (because it's a runtime error.)
