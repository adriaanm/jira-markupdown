scala.concurrent.SyncVar[A] does, in principle, support throwing an exception on `.get`.

However, the only possible way to set the exception to be thrown seems to be SyncVar's method

```scala
    private def setException(e: Throwable)
```

Since it is private (and not used anywhere inside SyncVar), I can see no way to set the Exception at all.

Proposal: make SyncVar.setException public.
For a long time there was this comment in SyncVar, which I followed up in the course of deprecation work by removing the method:
```scala
-  @deprecated("Will be removed in 2.8. SyncVar should not allow exception by design.")
-  def setWithCatch(x: => A) = synchronized {
-    try {
-      this set x
-    } catch {
-      case e =>
-        this setException e
-        throw e
-    }
-  }
-  
```
The fact that setException survived is an anomaly: if the comment can be believed, it too should be deleted.  I don't have any insight into the design motivations.
(In r22458) Removing some dead code from SyncVar and cleaning up a little.
Closes #3490, no review.
There is still field for enhancement. The presence of
```scala
 private var exception: Option[Throwable] = None
```
is - in spite of the fact that it's never assigned to anything other than None - quite confusing and discouraging form using this class.
(In r22856) Dredged some more dead code out of SyncVar.  Closes #3490, no review.
