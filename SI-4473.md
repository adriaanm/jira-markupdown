= problem =
There is no way (afaik) to link to a particular class. A workaround seems to be the direct linking of the right frame, which results in loosing the navigation on the left side. (Which makes it necessary to open the frame in a new tab first, to be able to get the address of it.)

= analysis =
I guess using frames is part of the problem, but I can't see an easy solution for that.

= enhancement recommendation =
It would be nice to push the current page to the address bar in the browser, so that it is possible to copy'and'paste that address and use it as a link.

Additionally there should be a way to link not only to a class, but also to a certain part of it, like the description or a specific method.

Also the state should be preserved, e. g. the text entered in the search fields, elements collapsed/expanded, state of the Ordering/Inherited/Visibility buttons to improve usability.
(In r24784) [scaladoc] Change URL when navigating Scaladoc, so as to allow linking to individual pages with the left frame intact. Patch submitted by Ruediger Keller. Closes SI-4473. No review.
