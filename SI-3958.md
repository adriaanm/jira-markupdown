The !TraversableOnce documentation says:
{code}
This trait is composed of those methods which can be implemented solely in terms of foreach
{code}
However, you have to implement many more methods than just {{foreach}} to get a !TraversableOnce:
{code}
scala> val travOnce = new TraversableOnce[Int] { def foreach[U](f: Int => U) = f(1) }
<console>:5: error: object creation impossible, since:
method copyToArray in trait TraversableOnce of type [B >: Int](xs: Array[B],start: Int,len: Int)Unit is not defined

       val travOnce = new TraversableOnce[Int] { def foreach[U](f: Int => U) = f(1) }
{code}
I see that there's a comment above the {{forall}} declaration in !TraversableOnce.scala that says:
{code}
Presently these are abstract because the Traversable versions use
breakable/break, and I wasn't sure enough of how that's supposed to
function to consolidate them with the Iterator versions.
{code}
So I gather it's a known issue, but I didn't see an issue tracking this problem, and this is the third time that it's bitten me, so I figured I should report this.

I guess the immediate solution for Scala 2.8 is to fix the documentation so that it says that many other things are required to define a !TraversableOnce, but it sure would be nice to only have to define {{foreach}} to get a !TraversableOnce like the documentation currently claims.
Ok, thanks for the clarification. I've switched this to a Documentation bug.

It's too bad TraversableOnce isn't intended to work this way - it's much easier to describe control flow with the {{foreach}} method than with {{next}} and {{hasNext}} from {{Iterator}}. Compare the hypothetical {{TraversableOnce}} version of a restarting iterator:

{code}
def restarting[T](getTrav: () => TraversableOnce[T]) = new TraversableOnce[T] {
  def foreach[U](f: T => U): Unit = {                                          
    try {                                                                      
      for (item <- getTrav())                                                  
        f(item)                                                                
    } catch {                                                                  
      case e: java.io.IOException => this.foreach(f)                           
    }                                                                          
  }                                                                            
}
{code}

with the {{Iterator}} implementation:

{code}
def restarting[T](getIter: () => Iterator[T]) = new Iterator[T] {
  var iter = getIter()
  def hasNext = {
    try {
      iter.hasNext
    } catch {
      case e: IOException => {
        this.iter = getIter()
        this.hasNext
      }
    }
  }
  def next = {
    try {
      iter.next
    } catch {
      case e: IOException => {
        this.iter = getIter()
        this.next
      }
    }
  }
}
{code}
You can as easily write that as
{code}
  new Traversable[T] { def foreach ... } iterator
{code}
There are also methods like Iterator.iterate and Iterator.continually and more: you never have to define next and hasNext yourself unless you want to.  TraversableOnce is a retrofit to eliminate code duplication between Iterator and Traversable, and except for internal use it's most likely less appropriate than one or the other of those.

I don't see the problem here.

Ok. The question, therefore, is: can these many more methods be implemented in terms of foreach? If they can, the documentation is correct.

The documentation DOES NOT SAY you just have to implement foreach. It says only that there isn't any methods that cannot be implemented in terms of foreach. Let's consider, for example, "exists", which is abstract. Here's an implementation:

{code}
def exists(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean) : Boolean = {
  class ResultFound extends Exception
  var result = false
  try {
    foreach { el =>
      result &&= p(el)
      if (result)
        throw new ResultFound
    }
  } catch (ex) {
    case _: ResultFound =>
  }
  result
}
{code}

There, implemented in terms of foreach, as required. Alas, that sentence does not end there, and the text that follows it makes it more clear:

> and which do not need access to a Builder

Methods which need access to a Builder are those methods that return a collection of best fitting type. So there is no map method there, for example.

    

Maybe it's just a dialectal difference, but to me the sentence:
{code}
This trait is composed of those methods which can be implemented
solely in terms of foreach and which do not need access to a Builder.
{code}
strongly suggests that all the methods that *can* be implemented in terms of foreach *have* been (and the last clause implies that no methods that require access to a builder are included in the TraversableOnce interface). But maybe that's just my dialect.

How about the following suggested rewording that hopefully corresponds to the intention more clearly:
{code}
This trait exists primarily to eliminate code duplication between
Iterator and Traversable, and thus implements some of the common
methods that can be implemented solely in terms of foreach without
access to a Builder. It also includes a number of abstract methods
whose implementations are provided by Iterator, Traversable, etc.

Directly subclassing TraversableOnce is not recommended - instead,
consider creating an Iterator with a next and hasNext method, or
create an Iterator with one of the methods on the Iterator object.
