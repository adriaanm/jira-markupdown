there were two problems with the original test: one was fixed (the existential type that made a tail position into a non-tail position), the other is not a regression: the try/catch with the return was never supported by tailcalls. Here's a simpler (yet isomorphic) test case that does not work on 2.9 nor 2.10:

{code}
 @annotation.tailrec
 final def searchClass: String = {
   "x" match {
     case null =>
       try {
         ""
       } catch {
         case e: ClassNotFoundException =>
          searchClass
       }
   }
 }
{code}
