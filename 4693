"The smallest difference between two values of Double." is java.double.Double.Min
```scala
scala> val a = java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE
a: Double = 4.9E-324

scala> val b = 2*java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE
b: Double = 1.0E-323

scala> a-b
res0: Double = -4.9E-324
```

And as the pull request on github tells defining a machine epsilon is really opinionated and most programmers would just make their own. Should this issue be closed?
