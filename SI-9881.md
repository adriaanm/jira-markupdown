Under current implementation, both fields are mostly empty. An immediate consequence is `:imports` doesn't report anything. Also it causes problems to other components that rely on these fields, such as when defining classes in REPL with `-Yrepl-class-based` enabled. See issue [SI-9880].

There seem to be a few issues here:
- `sym.thisType` on a module symbol always returns `NoPrefix`. Should probably use `sym.typeOfThis` instead.
- It doesn't handle renames because it won't be able to find the renames in importable members.
# -{{importableMembers}} may not always be able to return complete list (the case I encountered was with {{scala.reflect.runtime.universe}} which has a type of {{scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse}}). Thus we probably should not restrict {{importedNames}} to only {{importableMembers}} for non-wildcard imports.- This is caused by {{typeOfExpression}} inadvertently changing phase to {{jvm}}.
I took a look, too, with the same conclusion. I didn't notice #2 about renames but verified it. #3 I'm not sure. There's a related ticket for handling imported implicits, which is why I looked at it. Were you planning a PR?

Showing failure on rename. Works on regular module import. Also the failure on package import from the other ticket.

```
assigning a fix version of 2.11.9 because if `:imports` doesn't work at all we should at least remove it from the help. at bare minimum. obviously an actual fix would be much better
