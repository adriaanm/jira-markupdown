As seems always to be the case, as soon as someone mentions "maven" they're describing a bug that I cannot reproduce.

[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ scalac273 QueueMessage.java 
[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ scalac273 QueueMessage.2.java 
[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ scalac276 QueueMessage.java 
[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ scalac276 QueueMessage.2.java 
[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ scalac28 QueueMessage.java 
[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ scalac28 QueueMessage.2.java 
[paulp@jon 2377 (master)]$$ 
{code}
If you think this is not some sort of maven configuration bug, please tell me how to reproduce it without involving maven (else this ticket will be closed as invalid.)
