The Scala Language Specification v. 2.9, in section 10.1, 3rd paragraph (towards the end of page 131) reads:

"[...] Scala does not support [...], CDATA sections or processing instructions. [...]"

But the syntax section following this paragraph contains a production XMLContent using non-terminals "CDSect" and "PI", which refer to CDATA sections and processing instructions respectively.

Indeed, both CDATA and Processing Instructions are supported by the 2.9 versions of the language:

```scala

Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
