The global ExecutionContext is backed by a ForkJoinPool, but only if it can be properly instantiated, otherwise it turns to be a ThreadPoolExecutor.
Although ThreadPoolExecutor when configured as a fixed thread pool exhibit similar behavior it ain't exactly the same. It hurts the most when `blocking` is used, which only works with the ForkJoinPool. Viktor said `blocking` is merely there for documentation purpose but I find that highly counterintuitive.
As the ForkJoinPool is packaged with the scala library I'm wondering when this fallback would be used? Android maybe?
I would look at this problem on a different angle: if an application is unable to instantiate a ForkJoinPool due to a special environment, then extra steps should be explicitly taken by the developer in order to work around this limitation.
I didn't say that it was merely there for documentation.
I said it is documentation AND a hint to the underlying BlockContext that there will be blocking done in the containing code block.
Oh - I just realized that `BatchingExecutionContext` is private too.
One that doesn't just "pass-through" the thunk a la `DefaultBlockContext`, but insteads works with the thread pool to increase parallelism if needed.
This discussion should take place in the [scala-user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-user).
