As per past discussions, it should be possible to add arbitrary inequality and equality constraints on type parameters.  For example,
{code}
  trait Comprehendable[C[+_], +A] {
    ...
    def join[+B|A=C[B]] : C[B] = flatMap(x => x)
    ...
  }
{code}
Here the type parameter list for join is terminated with a vertical bar and followed by a comma separated list of constraints.  In this case the constraint is that the parameter A of the object join is being called upon must be equal to C[B]. Similarly,
where we would currently write something like
{code}
  def foo[A<:B,C<:D] ...
{code}
It could also be expressed like 
{code}
  def foo[A,C|A<:B,C<:D] ...
{code}
This enables multiple bounds to be enforced as well
{code}
  def foo[A|A<:B,A<:D] ...
{code}
And so forth.
