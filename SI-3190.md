It is counter-intuitive that the foreach method gives values from low to high, but the result of toArray is high to low values (for low array indices to higher).  This using a recent 2.8 nightly.
```scala
scala> scala.collection.immutable.TreeSet(1 to 4: _*) foreach println
1  
2
3
4

scala> scala.collection.immutable.TreeSet(1 to 4: _*).toArray foreach println
1  
2
3
4

scala> scala.collection.immutable.TreeSet(4 to 1 by -1: _*).toArray foreach println
1
2
3
4
```
