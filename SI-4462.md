== Problem ==
Example: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/List.html

Information about the classes' attributes is scatttered throughout the documentation, making it hard to understand the properties of a class.

== Analysis ==
On the first glance it looks like class List can be used like
` new List ` because the class attributes are not where most people expect them to be (in front of "class List ..."} but somewhere in the "small print".

Additionally the constructor is shown (which is only implicitly added by the compiler for usage by subclasses), which doesn't really serve any purpose.

== Enhancement Recommendation ==
If a class has attributes like sealed, final, abstract ScalaDoc should show them in front of "class List [+A] extends LinearSeq[A] with Product with GenericTraversableTemplate[A, List] with LinearSeqOptimized[A, List[A]]" and not somewhere else.

Additionally, it would be helpful to either not show these kind of instance constructor or at least hide it by default.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - ScalaDoc: Trunk (with the "new" CSS style) 
Oops ... I should check list of the bugs I have already reported better. This is a duplicate of #4451. :-/
