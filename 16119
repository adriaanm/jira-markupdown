Comparing with version 2.8.1.final too many methods have been removed from Enumeration:
I can understand the removal of the concurrency methods( wait, notify etc) and the odd names with $$ and _ signs
 which I don't know what they are for (they look like internal methods which shouldn't have been exposed).

But I don't understand the removal of the useful ones (mostly typical list methods) like:

value
valueOf
equals
exists
filter
flatmap
forAll
foreach
getClass
hashCode
iterator
map
name
nextId
nextName
readResolve
valueOf

Because of the missing of "valueOf" I found this difference. 
Btw: I mentioned nextId, nextName and readResolve for completeness but I don't know what they are for.
