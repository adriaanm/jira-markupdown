We had a recent PR around arity mismatches by [~apm], I believe -- maybe that fixed this one too?
No, totally unrelated, but this is interesting. Still no completions in arg of f2. The WIP typechecks the available arg while erroring. Another idea is to insert the required commas. The IDE offers placeholders.

This effort on SO deserves preservation: "if i type comma after dot and then try again to complete after dot, it works!"

scala> def f(g: String => Int) = g("42")
f: (g: String => Int)Int

scala> f(x => x.

scala> def f2(g: String => Int, i: Int) = g("42") * i
f2: (g: String => Int, i: Int)Int

scala> f2(x => x.

It drove me nuts when Eclipse couldn't autocomplete inside Java 8 lambdas.
