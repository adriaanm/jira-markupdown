"Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the sourcepath" sounds like gradle / zinc is passing {{/Users/ggr/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.vaadin/vaadin-server/7.7.5/28bc909336b9b399d93926b99148ce66d1bf3ed3/vaadin-server-7.7.5.jar}} as {{-sourcepath}}.

Also, the error ("bad source file") seems to come from the Java compiler, not the Scala compiler. So it seems not to be a bug on our end.
