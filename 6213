The spec is a bit confusing precisely because, to expand what Lukas said, there is no type "T*"; the language is clearly that the parameter is marked T* and what you get are "arguments of type T."  The type of the parameter marked T* is Seq[T] inside the method; there is no type T* even as an internal fiction.  (The analogy would be =>T cbn params, where =>T is such a fiction.)

(Referring to the implementation doesn't necessarily clarify, since the other real bug is SI-3761 where the nifty impl breaks down.  BTW, on that other bug, I won't submit the cbn tie-breaker, which I feel is misguided after all.)

This is certainly not a bug -- but a natural-language expression of the intuition would help us hoi poloi.
