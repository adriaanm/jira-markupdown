Imagine you have an expression 'e' of type W[Bar], and there is also a class X defined with type W[Foo].  If you match 'e', you will get warnings that there is no case clause for type X-- even though 'e' couldn't possible be an instance of X, as W[Foo] is not a subtype of W[Bar].  In fact, if you attempt to add a case clause for type X, you will get an error because the compiler (correctly) identifies that this case is impossible.

Example code below:
{code}
  sealed trait Foo
  sealed trait Bar extends Foo
  sealed trait W[T >: Bar <: Foo]
  sealed case class X() extends W[Foo]
  sealed case class Y() extends W[Bar]
  sealed case class Z[T >: Bar <: Foo](
    z1: W[T]
  ) extends W[T]

  object Main {
    def func(w: W[Bar]): Int = {
      w match {
        // Error if I include it, warning if I do not!
        // case X() => 2
        case Y() => 1
        case Z(z) => func(z)
      }
    }
  }
{code}

Here is a sample run.  First run has the case X() included, second run does not.

		w match {
                ^
one warning found
{code}
Workaround is to disable the warning for this match with @unchecked:

{code}
scala> val x = Some(1): Option[Int]                         
x: Option[Int] = Some(1)

scala> (x: @unchecked) match { case Some(1) => "some" }
res4: java.lang.String = some
{code}
(In r23199) Improves exhaustiveness analysis to not warn about types which
cannot match due to nonconformant type parameters.  Also, look at the
different warnings emitted in the test case based on the presence
of a constraint.  Nifty! Closes SI-3683, no review.
