I just stumbled across this bug. As the java class triggering this issue was generated with jaxb from an xsd, it can't be trivially worked around by just editing the java source (jaxb is called by the build process, so changes would be overwritten).

Fortunately, I have no java code referencing scala code, so just compiling the java code with javac first works for me. Still, I think this issue could cause problems in real world projects.
