I agree that for a *Stream* implementing this type of behavior is super inefficient and it makes no sense to do so.

However, with different behavioral implementation for such a standard method one cannot safely program with the base classes (_Iterable_,_Collection_,_Seq_,..) anymore since the implementations and their differences are unknown. However, this is what abstracting / object oriented programming is all about!


How about keeping _Projection.map_ strict, which means changing the _{Array,Set,..}.projection_ implementation. Then updates on the elements would not be reflected anymore, only changes to themself (as with _List_/_Stream_). This also seems more reasonable as _Array.toStream().map_ does exactly that and is what I would expect from _Array.projection.map'.

I would go even further: Remove the *Projection* classes and *projection* methods from *Iterable* and all its derications. Create wrapper classes for mutable collections instead, like *ProjectedArray* (compare Rich..) ) , which reflect all *updates*. Note: there is no need for it with immutable ones anyway. The current *Projection* stuff only makes the standard library unnecessary complicated!
