If I understand your usecase correctly - you're referencing documentation for both 2.11 and 2.12 and you want to be able to use the same links?

In scala/bug#9873 I explain why the the scheme was changed.

I believe this particular compatibility issue could be solved by producing both an "index.html" and a "package.html" for the package objects.

~~Out of curiosity I'd love to know where in your documentation this is an issue :)~~

EDIT: saw the travis link just now
