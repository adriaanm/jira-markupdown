Could you point me to the spec that this conforms to?

Your suggestion does not correspond to what I intended. With your suggestion, we're completely forgetting the already bound type A (which means that 'operator' method would receive any instantiation of a Base class with some other type). What I wanted is that 'operator' would only be applicable to other instantiation of Base class of the _same_ type A.

The following code should not be possible, while in your version it is (I didn't compiled it now, it just for making the point)

{code}
val d1 = DerivClass1(1)
val d2 = DerivClass1("test")

d1 operator d2
{code}
