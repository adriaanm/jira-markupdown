While debugging this, I noted this suspect code:
```scala
  class SubstWildcardMap(from: List[Symbol]) extends TypeMap {
    def apply(tp: Type): Type = try {
      tp match {
        case TypeRef(_, sym, _) if from contains sym =>
          BoundedWildcardType(sym.info.bounds)
        ...
```

Why is it okay to discard the prefix and type arguments? Shouldn't they be used to calculate the bounds?
