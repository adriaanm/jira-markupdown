Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a Scala Project
2. Configure Java save actions
   On the preference page for save actions (Ctrl+3 "save act...")
   Configure "Add final modifier to private fields"
3. Create a Scala class
4. Create a private val in that class e.g. private val p = this
5. Save

Content will change from
class A {
  private val p = this
}
to
class A {
  private final val p = this
}

When I switch off the save actions it does not happen.

Kind regards,
Jan
