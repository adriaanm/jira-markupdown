The ASM way to emit a field optionally expects a `value` as shown below.
```
    public FieldVisitor visitField(
        int access,
        String name,
        String desc,
        String signature,
        Object value)
```

GenASM does just that (well, in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/654 ) for `serialVersionUID` fields, thus no instructions are required for that in `clinit`.

First time I hear about fjbg's `JConstantValueAttribute`, thanks for the pointer.
