scalac reports error in the following code;
```scala
object Obj {
  val s1 = <a/><b/>
  println("hi")
}

value println is not a member of scala.xml.NodeBuffer possible cause: maybe a semicolon is missing before `value println'?
```


When `<a/></b>` is either replaced with `<a/>` alone or enclosed in parentheses or curly braces, code is compiled without error. Entering the semicolon as suggested also allows compilation to proceed.
This is intentional (if not ideal), as XML syntax allows newlines within NodeSeq literals.

```scala
:paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

<a/>
<b/>
<c/>


// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

res0: scala.xml.NodeBuffer = ArrayBuffer(<a/>, <b/>, <c/>)
```
But it should not consume whitespace if it looks ahead and detects the end of XML mode.

This issue sounded very familiar FSR. Why did I use the same example?
```scala
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object X {
  val s = <a/>
          <b/>
          <c/>

  println("ack")
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined object X

scala> X
ack
res0: X.type = X$@17f62e33

scala> object X {
     |   val s = <a/><b/>                                           <- spaces are harmless?
     |   println("ack")
     | }
defined object X

scala> X
ack
res1: X.type = X$@3da05287
```
The sbt from version 0.13.7 uses scala compiler to parse the whole file. The problem is, that if you split the file statement by statement and send to the compiler - all will be OK. If you send whole file - you will receive the compilation error.
See:
https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/1606

The test from repl:

```scala
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A {

val a = <a/>

val b = <c/><d/>
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined object A
```

And:

```scala
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object A {

val a = <a/><c/>

val b = <b/>
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

<console>:5: error: ';' expected but 'val' found.
val b = <b/>
```
