Consider the following code:
{code}
object Test extends Application {
	class Tr[T]
	implicit def i_tr = new Tr[Int]
	implicit def a_tr[A <: String] = new Tr[A]
	def tr[T](t : T)(implicit tr : Tr[T]) = tr
	tr(1)
}
{code}
To which the Scala compiler gives the following rather puzzling reply:
{code}
Test.scala:6: error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both method a_tr in object Test of type [A <: String]Test.Tr[A]
 and method i_tr in object Test of type => Test.Tr[Int]
 match expected type Test.Tr[Int]
{code}
Which is plain wrong as a_tr is not a valid choice for the implicit parameter. Explicitely passing a_tr will also correctly produce "type arguments [Int] do not conform to method a_tr's type parameter bounds [A <: String]".

This problem vanishes once the implicit methods have any parameters. The following fragment works just fine:
{code}
object Test extends Application {
	class Tr[T]
	implicit def i_tr(dummy:Int) = new Tr[Int]
	implicit def a_tr[A <: String](dummy:Int) = new Tr[A]
	def tr[T](t : T)(implicit tr : Int => Tr[T]) = tr(1)
	tr(1)
}
{code}

Removing the type bounds also "fixes" the problem. Apologies if this a known bug or somehow intended behavior.
This has been fixed in the context of ticket SI-2421.
