Works in 2.9.1, fails in 2.10.0-M1

```scala
type Id[X] = X
trait Pointed[F[_]]
implicit val idInstance: Pointed[Id] = new Pointed[Id] {}
def point[F[_]: Pointed, A](a: A): F[A] = sys.error("")
def ambigram[F[_]: Pointed]: F[Int] = point(0)
```

The error:

```scala
<console>:15: error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both value idInstance in of type => Pointed[Id]
 and value evidence$2 of type Pointed[F]
 match expected type Pointed[F]
           point(0)
                ^
```
This was relying on a bug in 2.9.2, which was somewhat inadvertently fixed in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6975b4888d / #5354.

Both implicits were eligible, but the `evidence$2` won on a buggy interpretation of the subclass rule.

```scala
(sym1, sym2, isInProperSubClassOrObject(sym1, sym2))
(value evidence$2,value idInstance,true)
```
