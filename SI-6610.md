Inherited method with type constructor causes "name clash between inherited members" error when specialization is involved:
{code}
trait A[T[C], @specialized(Int) C] {
  def f(x: T[C]): T[C]
}

trait B[T[C], @specialized(Int) C] extends A[T, C] {
  def f(x: T[C]) = x
}
{code}
{code}
5: error: name clash between inherited members:
method f:(x: T[Int])T[Int] in trait B and
method f:(x: _3[Int])_3[Int] in trait A
have same type after erasure: (x: Object)Object
trait B[T[C], @specialized(Int) C] extends A[T, C] {
      ^
one error found
