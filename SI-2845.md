The constructors of classes Set2, Set3 etc in scala.collection.immutable.Set should be private (to the package), since they don't explicitly preserve the element uniqueness invariant.

import scala.collection.immutable.Set._

new Set2(1, 1) //creates a Set with two equal elements
(In r23964) Make scala.collection.immutable.Set1, .Set2, Set3, Set4 constructors private to the collection package. Closes SI-2845. No review.
