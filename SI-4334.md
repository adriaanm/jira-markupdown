=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
In the interpreter, after loading this code:
```scala
object MyEnum extends Enumeration {
    type MyEnum = Value
    val A, B = Value
}

val values1 = MyEnum.values
val values2 = MyEnum.values
values1 == values2
```

gives the following output
```scala
scala> :load ../bug2.scala
Loading ../bug2.scala...
defined module MyEnum
values1: MyEnum.ValueSet = MyEnum.ValueSet(A, B)
values2: MyEnum.ValueSet = MyEnum.ValueSet(A, B, Value)
res18: Boolean = false

scala> MyEnum.values
res19: MyEnum.ValueSet = MyEnum.ValueSet(A, B, Value)

scala> MyEnum.values
res20: MyEnum.ValueSet = MyEnum.ValueSet(A, B, Value)

```


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
`MyEnum.values` should be referentially transparent:
`MyEnum.values == MyEnum.values`.

=== What do you see instead? ===
`MyEnum.values` gets an additional member named `Value` after the first use.
=== Additional information ===
While I can understand that the implementation of Enumeration is quite complex, I'm worried that it still doesn't work. Additionally, the documentation should probably explain that it performs evil magic and should be used with care, i.e. by following the given pattern quite closely. A specification of "quite closely" would be most appreciated.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.0, 2.8.1
  - Java:
```scala
# java -version
java version "1.6.0_24"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.1-b02, mixed mode)
```
  - Operating system: Ubuntu linux 9.10
Part of the problem might stem from the fact that the method
```scala
  protected final def Value: Value = Value(nextId)     
```
(declared [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_8_1_final/src//library/scala/Enumeration.scala#L131 here])
is not filtered out by populateNameMap:
```scala
    val methods = getClass.getMethods filter (m => m.getParameterTypes.isEmpty && classOf[Value].isAssignableFrom(m.getReturnType))
```
each of those methods is afterward invoked by `populateNameMap`; the `Value` method will then be invoked, it will construct an instance of `Val`, and the `Val` constructor will reset `vsetDefined` altering the return value of values (even if its definition seems immutable, it is not).
To complete the picture, `populateNameMap` is only called indirectly through `Val.toString -> Enumeration.nameOf`.

Problems:
1) The `Val` constructor should *not* reset `vsetDefined`, it should rather throw an exception if `vsetDefined` was true, i.e. `values` had been invoked.

2) `populateNameMap` should filter out `Value`, and a big fat warning should be added against adding new method with the same signature without fixing `populateNameMap`. Alternatively, `populateNameMap` could use `getDeclaredMethods` on the class of the actual enumeration, which filters out inherited methods.

3) Of course, this does not solve the fragility problem: if the Enumeration instance declares a method like `randomElem(): Value`, it will mistaken for an enumeration entry. As already asked, this "evil magic" should be documented.

Should I provide a patch for 1) and 2)?
The immediate issue is a duplicate of #3687.  I understand the general concern about Enumeration, but this should be discussed on the mailing lists.  This subject has been discussed before, so you are most likely to succeed by understanding those discussions and giving concrete proposals.  (I am not the final authority here- these are suggestions.)
