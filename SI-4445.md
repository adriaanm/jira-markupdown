Some examples of the scala package documentation.
```scala
  // these are "too little"
  type AbstractMethodError = AbstractMethodError
  type AnyRef = AnyRef

  // these are "too much"
  class Unit extends Any with AnyVal
  case class Cell [+T] (elem: T) extends Product with Serializable
  class cloneable extends Annotation with StaticAnnotation
```

1) type AnyRef = AnyRef should not have made it out of the gate.

2) we can't want to include "Product with Serializable" on every case class in the world.

3) the definition of cloneable is "extends StaticAnnotation". It is quite an unfortunate and noisy penalty if every such annotation has to be characterized as "extends Annotation with StaticAnnotation" just because Annotation is an abstract class and not a trait.  Let's say that not burying people in redundant information is more important than being 100% consistent about how we present the parents and say "extends StaticAnnotation".  The problem of "Any wiht AnyVal" is similar; scaladoc is thinking AnyVal is a trait.  The AnyVal bits I can special case for now.

4) Same thing with "extends AnyRef".  If we consider it advantageous to be able to omit this when writing the code, surely it's also advantageous not to have to read it on every class for which AnyRef is the only parent.  Documentation is about presenting information usefully, a purpose which is not served by never omitting anything.

5) Do we have the capability to link to javadoc? If not that's pretty glaring.  If so, all those dozens of aliases which presently say "type Foo = Foo" should in addition to saying "type Foo = java.lang.Foo", link to the java class.  This is the minimum people expect of documentation.

6) Prefixes seem to be discarded in almost all cases.  So everything which uses any enum is of type "Value", and even the link goes straight to Enumeration.Value. [[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/rc/scala/swing/Oriented.html Example]]. You're down to reading the source code at that point. (On the plus side, there is a link to the source code.)

I have fixed some of the prefix issues locally, but scaladoc makes it difficult to do in a principled fashion.  I don't want to check in code that does a bunch of string manipulations to get the right output, but it would be far superior to not fixing these issues.
Regarding the excessive usage of Any/AnyRef/AnyVal in signatures:

Maybe the kinds {{class}}, {{trait}} and {{object}} can be implicitly considered to be a subclass of {{AnyRef}} and the value types could get another word as a kind, like {{value}}?

Considering that the user can't really define any new AnyVal classes, how would he know that the "right" definition of value types is "final class" instead of e. g. "value/struct/data/bippy/..."?

The "final class" extending "AnyVal" behave very differently from every other "class" (No nullability, no Constructor, literals, etc. ...). 

I can hardly think of any person which would, when asked to characterize an Int, respond with "it's a "final class". It is just in no way an accurate description, so why should ScalaDoc keep claiming it?

I would tend to the opinion that a slighty more high-level view instead of showing the "implementation details" would be an improvement.
1) fixed: [AbstractMethodError](http://http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.package@AbstractMethodError:AbstractMethodError) and AnyRef is gone
2) I would rather include Product. I find Product to be a blessing for deep matches:
```scala
def deepCount(t: Any): Int = t match {
  case wilf@WhatImLookingFor => 1
  case p: Product => p.toList.map(deepMatch(_)).sum
  case _ => 0
}
```
We could do without Serializable, but it wouldn't make sense to only remove Serializable but not Product.
3) I see what you mean, but we'd have to find a principled way of dropping parents. I'd rather steer away from this, as it might come back to bite us later.
4) I think that made sense back when we didn't have case classes, but now the same class C could extend Any, AnyRef or AnyVal. I'd rather not drop it. WDYT?
5) We'll have links to external documentation soon. That's #191. In the meantime the fully qualified name is shown.
6) Fixed in #3314

I will close this bug as Won't Fix, since I rejected points 2, 3 and 4, but please feel free to open new bugs for the points you have strong oppinions on, so we can discuss them.
