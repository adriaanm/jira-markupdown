```scala
object Test extends App {
  trait Foo
  def foo[T](x: T): T with Foo = ???

  class C
  val c: C with Foo = foo(new C)
}

23:40 ~/Projects/Master/sandbox (master)$ s
Test.scala:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Test.C
 required: Test.Foo with Test.C
  val c: C with Foo = foo(new C)
                          ^
one error found
```

Omitting the explicit type for c or qualifying the call to foo with an explicit type argument makes the code compile.
