In revision 21018, `filterKeys` and `mapValues` started returning map views in everything but name. This cause a few problems, however -- the lack of a distinct type does not help identifying them as returning non-strict collections, and they lack a `force` method to retrieve a strict collection.

I'd suggest returning a `MapView`, but there isn't any such collection at the moment -- `view` returns an `IterableView` instead. Perhaps the ideal would be to create a `MapView`, and make `filterKeys` and `mapValues` only non-strict in them.
