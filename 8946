Backport for 2.10.x

I've manually checked that this works:

{noformat}
backport/1826 ~/code/scala squala -classpath build/quick/classes/scalacheck
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.1-20130108-190630-3b74691d35 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_37).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> import org.scalacheck._
import org.scalacheck._

scala> type ListString = List[String]
defined type alias ListString

scala> implicitly[Arbitrary[List[String] => List[String]]]
res0: org.scalacheck.Arbitrary[List[String] => List[String]] = org.scalacheck.Arbitrary$$anon$1@7d365e01

scala> implicitly[Arbitrary[ListString => ListString]]
res1: org.scalacheck.Arbitrary[ListString => ListString] = org.scalacheck.Arbitrary$$anon$1@7fc4fe21
{noformat}

I haven't added this as a test case as this is a straight duplicate of SI-6846 which was already tested.
