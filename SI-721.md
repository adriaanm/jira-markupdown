It seems to me that reduceRight could have a more general type:
{code}
def  reduceRight[B >: A](op : (A, B) => B) : B
{code}
rather than
{code}
def  reduceRight[B >: A](op : (B, B) => B) : B
{code}

From time to time it would be very useful to have reduceRight available at this type. Likewise for reduceLeft.
