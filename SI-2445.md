In Section 6.2, the Scala language spec states that classOf[C] is a literal.  However pattern matching does not work with these kinds of literals.  It should work, as it would be useful.

Does not compile:

{code}
object MatchClass {
  val c: Class[_] = classOf[String]
  c match {
    case classOf[Int] => "Int!"
    case classOf[String] => "String!"
    case c: Class[_] => "Something else: " + c.getName
  }
}
{code}
