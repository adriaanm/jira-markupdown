(extempore in [r25452|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25452]) Attacked classpaths to get "." off of it when it's not actually
specified. The commit makes me nervous, but there's no invisible way to
fix something like this.

 ** Attention, this commit changes classpath handling **

We desperately need some way of testing that the classpath has
certain qualities and does not have others; partest is not that way.
Closes scala/bug#4857, no review.
