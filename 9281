You deemed it puzzling on the other ticket, and in fact I did just briefly propose a puzzler https://github.com/scalapuzzlers/scalapuzzlers.github.com/issues/121 where the charm lay in the method, which was a prefix operator (with empty param list). The OP didn't expect `f(v)` to behave differently from `f(!v)`. If you keep F0 conversion, but try again with empty application in case of failure, then I'll reopen the puzzler.
