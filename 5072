Basically my comment was not on this part, which doesn't look beginner friendly but is probably correct:
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?{val +(x$$1: ?>: Long(1L) <: Any): ?}
```

But the (bogus?) message about the conversions to floating point numbers:
```scala
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2float in object Predef of type (x: Int)Float
 and method int2double in object Predef of type (x: Int)Double
[...]
```

I just felt a bit uneasy that the compiler even considered something with flaoting points when only doing integer math...
