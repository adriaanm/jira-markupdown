I created an Annotation (MyAnnotation) in java with @Target(ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR).
And I created a case class annotated with MyAnnotation.
the scalac compiles it without any errors, but the MyAnnotation is attatched to the class, not constructor.

Is this a scalac bug , or is there a special syntax for this case?

I tested it under sun-jdk 1.6.0_16 , scala-2.7.7-final , 2.8.0.r19650-b20091114020153 .

I attached the source code and output.
Hi,

The syntax you used attaches the annotation to the class. Instead, try

{code}
case class Target @MyAnnotation() (a: Int)
{code}

Note that the scala compiler does not check the `@Target` field, you can attach any annotation anywhere.
