I found this when experimenting more with SI-10078. I guess it is related but not the same. 

When a package contains only classes, {{@group}} doesn't work.

{code:scala}
/** @group foo */
class Bar()

/** @group bar */
class Baz()

class Other()
{code}

!only-classes.PNG|thumbnail!

If I add an object, the groups work:

{code:scala}
/** @group foo */
class Bar()

/** @group bar */
class Baz()

class Other()

object NotClass
{code}

!classes-and-objects.PNG|thumbnail!

(I also noted that now the "only show superclasses on hover" effect is disabled. On purpose?)
