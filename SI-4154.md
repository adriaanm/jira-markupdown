This is a case where the implicit resolution and the compilation fails because M is contravariant.

{code}
object ImplicitResolutionTest {

  trait M[-A]

  case class Bar(i:Int)

  object Bar {
    implicit val barIsM:M[Bar] = new M[Bar]{}
  }

  trait Foo[-X]

  object Foo {
    implicit def fooIsM[A](implicit m:M[A]):M[Foo[A]] = new M[Foo[A]]{}
  }

  def resolve[X](implicit m:M[X]):M[X] = m
  
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
	resolve[Bar]                       // ok
        resolve[Foo[Bar]](Foo.fooIsM[Bar]) // ok
	resolve[Foo[Bar]]                  //error
  }
}
{code} 

I'd expect that Foo.fooIsM is a valid implicit value but instead I get:

{code}
   [scalac] ImplicitResolutionTest.this.Foo.fooIsM is not a valid implicit value for pkg.ImplicitResolutionTest.M[pkg.ImplicitResolutionTest.Foo[pkg.ImplicitResolutionTest.Bar]] because:
   [scalac] could not find implicit value for parameter m: pkg.ImplicitResolutionTest.M[A]
{code}

Scala:2.8.1/Windows

Cheers!
Hold on. If either M[X] or Foo[X] is invariant then the compiler can find the implicit definition. Why this interplay between the implicit search scope and variance? 

It is sad that using a variance annotation breaks modularity: now anyone that wants to add a new type that is a M must open the definition of object M. 

I can't explain it, it was more from an intuition than anything else. Having M invariant in the code from which I extracted the snipped felt a lot better. That, the compiler and you saying it is wrong, I din't look twice.

Now since you ask, I played with the variance of M and Foo and here are the compilation results:

{code}
M    Foo   compiles
-     -      No   
+     -      No
inv   -      Yes
-     +      Yes
+     +      Yes
Inv   +      Yes
{code}

It is strange that the compiler says Foo.fooIsM is invalid but it compiles when I provide Foo.fooIsM[Bar] explicitly. I'm at a loss to understand this error but if there is an explanation I'd like to hear it.
