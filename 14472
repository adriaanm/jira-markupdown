See also scala/bug#710 and scala/bug#805. I've attached the full console output. It dies in the lambdalift phase

How can I find out what the compiler was doing when this error arose? Its a bit hard to produce a minimal test case without this.

A decidedly un-minimal test case is here: http://scalaz.googlecode.com/svn/branches/scala-2.8, SVN revision 825.

I'm on version 2.8.0.r18583-b20090827020153
