The origin of the issue is the spurious error I've shown to Eugene Burmako. It's mentioned by him in the link to scala-internals in the first comment. Let me repeat it here.

{code}
  class Id[A] {
    type F[X <: A] = X
  }
  trait A1
  class A2 extends A1
  object O {
    type Test1 = Id[A1]#F[A2] // not compilable
  }
{code}

The code is still not compilable as for scala-2.11.5.
So please do not close the issue.
