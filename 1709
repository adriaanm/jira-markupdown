I think it was assigned to you because I speculated above that it is related to SI-1110, and that because this bug also is triggered only when one uses a method name which is shared by the name of a primitive operation.

On closer inspection I don't think they're related except inasmuch as the platonically ideal fix to both bugs would likely involve some shared machinery for dealing with the issue.
