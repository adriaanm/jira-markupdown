hi,

i am having a lot of implicit conversions for default arguments using my DSL. for instance:

```scala
object BufRd {
   def ar( numChannels: Int, bufID: GE, phase: GE = 0, loop: GE = 1, interp: GE = 2 ) : GE = ...
}
```

where integers and floats are converted to a GE using an implicit conversion in the scope. now, the result is that scaladoc generates this:

```scala
def ar(numChannels: Int, bufID: GE, phase: GE = de.sciss.synth.package.floatToGE(0), loop: GE = de.sciss.synth.package.floatToGE(1), interp: GE = de.sciss.synth.package.floatToGE(2)): GE
```

which obviously is very ugly and barely readable.

i thus propose an enhancement, for example in the form of a scaladoc switch, to not resolve implicit conversions in the doc-generation but to keep the original readable form of the signatures.
Hi Vlad, I think this issue has been resolved in Scala 2.9.0 or 2.9.1. Currently I get this printed in the docs:

{{{
    def ar (numChannels: Int, buf: GE, index: GE = 0.0f, loop: GE = 1.0f, interp: GE = 2.0f): BufRd
}}}

which looks fine and readable to me! Can close this issue?

(BTW can someone check the JIRA markup docs -- the curly quotes for monospaced just *don't work*)
