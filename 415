It needs to be fixed because having the interpreter simply call toString() results in scala/bug#1404.  Fixing the problem by casting the argument of toString() to Any first causes pretty printing of arrays to break.  I would personally be happy with the solution of casting to Any first.  So take your pick, remove the overloaded methods or lobby that arrays be fixed.
