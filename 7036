Stream is a caching generator of values, and it works exactly like that:
```scala
scala> val a = Array(1, 2, 3)
a: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2, 3)

scala> val b = a.toStream
b: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> a(1) = 200; a(2) = 300

scala> b.toList
res1: List[Int] = List(1, 200, 300)

scala> a(1) = 2000; a(2) = 3000

scala> b.toList
res3: List[Int] = List(1, 200, 300)
```

Once the value has been generated, it cannot be changed. Before it has been generated, it is unknown. If toStream were to copy the whole collection, then it would not be acting like a Stream, but like a List.
