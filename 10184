I imagine it would be possible to work around this by casting the ScriptEngine returned to IMain:

{noformat}
val engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("scala")
val iMain = engine.asInstanceOf[scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.IMain]
{noformat}

and then just interact with it directly with there, bypassing the official JSR 223 API. (I don't know IMain well enough to give details offhand, though.)
