There are two things that should be added to this proposal before we can add this to the Scala standard library:

  1. Code examples that show the usefulness of `Either` in Scala (I am sure there are plenty, see Haskell). Focus should be on examples that are significantly harder to implement using existing language mechanisms (e.g. pattern matching) or classes in the standard library.

  2. Test cases that can be added to the test suite. A test case consists of an executable `object` (extending `Application` or providing a `main` method) called `Test`, and a file containing the expected output.

Note that we are interested in adding an `Either` type to the library, and the proposal is well worked out. It's just that the two things I mentioned are missing, and people in LAMP currently don't have the resources to provide them.
