```scala
object foo {
  val foo = if (bar) s"x" else s""
  val bar = true
}
```
fails with:
```
test.scala:3: error: ';' expected but 'val' found.
val bar = true
^
one error found
```
Reduced. It's losing the newline token after a completely empty interpolated string. If it's s"1", or a semicolon instead of a newline, or two newlines, or a comment after the empty string, it compiles.
```scala
class A {
  s""
  5
}
```
To detect triple-quotes, it's using CharArrayReader.nextRawChar instead of nextChar, so it's not detecting "potentialLineEnd".

Quasiquotes are thanks enough.

This was a quickie because I'd just looked at that other EOL bug.
