Object#hashCode javadoc states the following: “Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application”. The same fact applies, of course, to hashCode being executed on equivalent objects (e.g. java enum constants) in different JVMs. This is perhaps illogical (especially for enum constants), but it means that unless you do proper serialization/deserialization instead of just dumping the hashtable, deserialized instances will be pretty much broken.
This is a duplicate of #1600, yes?
