Discovered this playing with `scala.concurrent.Duration` string parsing in 2.11.8.  
```scala
scala> import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration

scala> Duration("1 day")
res1: scala.concurrent.duration.Duration = 1 day

scala> Duration("-1 day")
res2: scala.concurrent.duration.Duration = -86399999999999 nanoseconds
```

The negative value is exactly 1 nanosecond short of a day.  Also, because it's expressed in nanoseconds, it's not nearly as readable.
