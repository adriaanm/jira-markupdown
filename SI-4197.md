when run on an empty sequence, IndexedSeqOptimized.indexWhere returns the value of the supplied from parameter, instead of -1.

=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}

scala> "".indexWhere (x => false, 1)
res124: Int = 1

scala> "".indexWhere (x => false, 101)
res125: Int = 101


{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

it should return -1 on an empty sequence. for example, the list version outputs this:

{code}

scala> Nil.indexWhere (x => false, 1)
res0: Int = -1

scala> "".toList.indexWhere (x => false, 110)
res1: Int = -1
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===

the value of whatever is supplied as "from" parameter

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

  - Java: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_21
  - Operating system: Windows 7 x64
(In r24139) Fixed bug in IndexedSeqOptimized.indexWhere such that the empty
string would find things all over the place.  Closes SI-4197, no review.
