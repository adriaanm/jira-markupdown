I just added the result of:
```scala
sbt -Dscalac.debug.tvar=1 compile &> failure-report.log
```
on the result of minimization (commit da3ae17524c35434fa6d9711fdc67435279a831d).

Then, I minimized further and got down to [28 lines](https://github.com/ps-mr/LinqOnSteroids/commit/01c9e35db6c5fc12c50638a1cf0951da33934aef) and produced, the same way, failure-report-2.log (also attached).
