I think SI-1409 seems to be the main reason for this problem. I know it compiles when you just write
{code}
scalac src/B.java src/F.java
{code}

but doesn't work for dependency management because it parses the symbols and their types (and it doesn't know the type of Inner but knows of B.Inner). Because of SI-1409, even if you have just src/B.java and some Scala class that uses the nested static class then you will get type error from the usual compiler (that doesn't happen with full names but I realize that's a workaround far from perfect).
