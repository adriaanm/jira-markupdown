I assume you haven't tried that code.  Everyone thinks everything in the collections is easier than it is because they underappreciate the impact of variance.  (The toSet inherited by immutable.Set does not have the signature given.) I can implement it, but first I want to see if I can figure out what the roadmap is for dealing with inherited variance because the current approaches are lacking.
