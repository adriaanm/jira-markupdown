It's easiest to just look at the attachment in order to understand the problem.

The Java class _my.test.bl.bo.CashDrawer.getDrawer()_ is returning a type of _my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer_. Scala thinks it's returning a type of _my.test.bl.bo.Drawer_ even though _CashDrawer_ specifically imports _my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer_.

{code:title=CashDrawer.java}
package my.test.bl.bo;

import my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer;

public class CashDrawer {
    public static Drawer getDrawer() {
        return new Drawer();
    }
}
{code}

Scala will interpret it correctly only if the type names are all fully qualified.

{code:title=CashDrawer.java}
package my.test.bl.bo;

public class CashDrawer {
    public static my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer getDrawer() {
        return new my.test.bl.bo.location.Drawer();
    }
}
{code}
