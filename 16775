Given the information that two types are equal as provided by implicit resolution of =:=, it should be possible to convert not just from the first type to the second, but from the second type to the first.

Example: 
```scala
class Bippy[A](a: A) {
  def prefix(s: String)(f: A => A)(implicit ev: A =:= String): A = {
    s + ev(f(a)) // <- currently no way to get this back to an A
    ev.inverse(s + ev(f(a))) // <- proposed
  }
}
```
