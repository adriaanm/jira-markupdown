this is described as:

{code}
 def flatMap[B](f: ((A, B)) => Traversable[B]): Map[B]
{code}

obviously Map[B] doesn't exist, and it should probably be something like Iterable[B]?

This is quite tricky to fix. Redefining the use case won't work, and I tried getting the correct type back in [891769fa|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/891769fae541513d68ce7a8e84b7213472c333c9]:

{code}
/**
 * @define Coll Iterable
 */
class Iterable[T] {
  /**
   * @usecase def foo[T]: $Coll[T]
   */
  def foo[T: Numeric]: Iterable[T]
}

/**
 * @define Coll D1
 */
class Map[A, B] extends Iterable[(A,B)] {
  protected type D1[_] = Map[A, B]
}
{code}

But that won't work well, as the return type of function {{f}} is not constrained to be {{(A,B) => (C,D)}}.

So, I'll close this bug as won't fix, and I created bug SI-6128 about making the use case generation fully automatic.
