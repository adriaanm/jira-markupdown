It's worse than that.  Here is TraversableOnce:
```scala
def size: Int = {
  var result = 0	
  for (x <- self) result += 1
  result
}
```
Why is this not sufficient.  Does someone have evidence that some other way of writing this is faster if you have to traverse the collection regardless? Because otherwise we could just stop overriding it without a clear reason.
