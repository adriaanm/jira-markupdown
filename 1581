Two weird cases not handled by the patch:

Plugin.scala
```scala
  def abort : Nothing = {
    assert(false);
    throw new Error;
  }
```

The assert method in the same class (shown below) throws error anyway, so not sure what the aim is there.
```scala
  def assert(b : Boolean) : Unit = {
    if (!b)
       throw new Error();
  }
```

Another case is Nodes.scala.
```scala
  def assert(b : Boolean) : Unit = {
    if (!b) {
      if (this == null) assert(false)
      throw new Error
    }
  }
```

Infinite recursion in case this == null (which should not happen under normal circumstances). I assume that line can be removed, but the patch doesn't include it.
