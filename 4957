The bug seems to be in scala.collection.mutable.SetLike:

{code}
74  /** Adds an element to this $$coll.
75	   *
76	   *  @param elem the element to be added
77	   *  @return `true` if the element was not yet present in the set, `false` otherwise.
78	   */
79	  def add(elem: A): Boolean = {
80	    val r = contains(elem)
81	    this += elem
82	    r
83	  }
{code}

This definition of add() clearly returns true if the element WAS present in the set, contrary to the comment.
