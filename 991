I refer to the spec:

The type of a designator is the type $$T$$ of the entity it refers to, with the
following exception: The type of a path (\sref{sec:paths}) $$p$$ which
occurs in a context where a stable type (\sref{sec:singleton-types}) is required is the
singleton type \lstinline@$$p$$.type@.

I invite everyone to change this rule, and observe what breaks!
