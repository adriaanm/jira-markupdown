It looks to me like it works fine with pure interfaces (notice the test case checked in r19320 still works) and indeed I have no problem extending ParentInterface:
{code}
scala> new ParentInterface { def concatenate(strings: String*): String = null }
res2: java.lang.Object with ParentInterface{def concatenate(strings: String*): String} = $$anon$$1@788c1852
{code}
But overriding a concrete method, not so successful.
