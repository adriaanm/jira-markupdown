This looks very similar to SI-2991, which was closed with NotABug.  

Interestingly, you can explicitly call the varargs f with f(5, Seq.empty: _*) but there is no way to specify the non-varargs method (at least I can't come up with one).

I've tried to wrap my head around the language in the relevant bit of the JLS ([section 15.12.2.5|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.5]);
the "informal intuition" supports favoring def f[T](x: T): T, but I find nothing supporting that in the formal definition.  I won't even try to understand section 6.26.3 of the Scala spec on a Friday afternoon.  :)
