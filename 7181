Notice it warns the other way:
```scala
scala> println(y == x)
<console>:10: warning: comparing values of types Int and Some[Int] using `==' will always yield false
              println(y == x)
                        ^
```
a) is not going to happen, equals must be symmetric.  b) is not going to happen either.  A warning might be possible, but it's harder than it looks to warn where you want to without creating spurious warnings elsewhere.
