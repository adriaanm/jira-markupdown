Currently, {{scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner}} insists on calling exit; there is no way to avoid this, e.g., when one wants to call {{MainGenericRunner.main}} from within a test or benchmark harness.

In contrast, {{scala.tools.nsc.Main}}, solves this problem quite neatly by separating the main functionality from the call to exit:

{code}
def main(args: Array[String]) {
  process(args)
  exit(if (reporter.hasErrors) 1 else 0)
}
{code}

It would be great if {{scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner}} could follow the lead of {{scala.tools.nsc.Main}}.
(In r23426) Don't call exit from MainGenericRunner in a way which is
impossible to avoid.  Closes SI-3901, no review.
