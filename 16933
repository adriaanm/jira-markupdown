Given the following macro definition

{code}
  def mkInt = macro mkIntImpl
  def mkIntImpl(c: Context): c.Expr[Any] = {
    println(c.enclosingApplication)
    c.reify{ 23 }
  }
{code}

I would expect something other than EmptyTree to be returned in the body of the macro when applied like so,

{code}
val i1 = mkInt
val i2 = identity(mkInt)
{code}

However in both cases the result is EmptyTree.
