Given the following macro definition
```scala
  def mkInt = macro mkIntImpl
  def mkIntImpl(c: Context): c.Expr[Any] = {
    println(c.enclosingApplication)
    c.reify{ 23 }
  }
```

I would expect something other than EmptyTree to be returned in the body of the macro when applied like so,
```scala
val i1 = mkInt
val i2 = identity(mkInt)
```

However in both cases the result is EmptyTree.
