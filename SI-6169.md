In java you can write

```scala
Circle circle = CircleBuilder.create().centerX(100).centerY(115).radius(100).build();
```

This is a builder pattern which make use of existential f-bounds
The problem is that in scala the skolems get erased after two method calls and so the next method doesn't exist.


if I javap the java code
```
const #33 = NameAndType #51:#52;//  create:()Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder;
const #34 = NameAndType #53:#54;//  centerX:(D)Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder
;
const #35 = NameAndType #55:#54;//  centerY:(D)Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder
;
const #36 = NameAndType #56:#54;//  radius:(D)Ljavafx/scene/shape/CircleBuilder;

const #37 = NameAndType #57:#58;//  build:()Ljavafx/scene/shape/Circle;
```
then I can see that the names and types are stored in bytecode (so a sort of runtime type info / refied generics)


In scala:
```scala
val circle = CircleBuilder.create().centerX(100).centerY(115).radius(100).build()
```

causes
```
C:\scala-2.10.0-M6\myexamples>scalac javafxbuilder.scala
javafxbuilder.scala:19: error: value centerY is not a member of ?0
      val circle = CircleBuilder.create().centerX(100).centerY(115).radius(100).
build()
                                                       ^
one error found
```

The only way to solve it in scala is to do a downcast after two methods (.asInstanceOf[CircleBuilder[_]]) or implicit conversion or to generate reified skolems _$x beforehand.
```scala
val circlebuilder = CircleBuilder.create().asInstanceOf[CircleBuilder[_ <: CircleBuilder[_ <: CircleBuilder[_ <: CircleBuilder[_]]]]]
```
which generates $_1, $_2 and $_3 for calling 6 methods (2 per skolem)

This looks a bit hackish to me and very unscala.

Actually, it's not a Java-interop problem, the equivalent Scala code also fails.

```scala
object Main {
  def foo(b: CircleBuilderScala[_]) =
    b.foo.foo  // error: value foo is not a member of _$1
}

class CircleBuilderScala[B <: CircleBuilderScala[B]] {
  def foo: B = ???
}

```

See also #4745 and other tickets about f-bounded type parameters + type inference.
Here's a way you can use the techniques touched on in #4745 to centralize your casting pain.

```scala
scala> type CircleBuilderF = ({type CB <: CircleBuilder[CB]; type CB1 = CB with CircleBuilder[CB]})#CB1
defined type alias CircleBuilderF

scala> def newCircleBuilder: CircleBuilderF = CircleBuilder.create.asInstanceOf[CircleBuilderF]
newCircleBuilder: CircleBuilderF

scala> newCircleBuilder.centerX(0).centerX(0).build()
res28: javafx.scene.shape.Circle = Circle@38b9a306
```

Now, if we can just figure out how to roll this into the compiler...
You can actually centralize this hack as follows:

```scala
scala> implicit class RichFBoundBuilder[B[X <: B[X]]](val _builder: B[_]) {
  type B1 = X forSome { type X <: B[X] }
  def asScala: B1 = _builder.asInstanceOf[B1]
}
warning: there were 2 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined class RichFBoundBuilder

scala> import javafx.scene.shape._
import javafx.scene.shape._

scala> CircleBuilder.create.asScala.centerX(0).centerX(0).build()
res0: javafx.scene.shape.Circle = Circle@6c60efe7
```
RichFBoundBuilder doesn't require the proof it looks like it requires, though:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.1 (OpenJDK Client VM, Java 1.6.0_27).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

implicit class RichFBoundBuilder[B[X <: B[X]]](val _builder: B[_]) {
  type B1 = X forSome { type X <: B[X] }
  def asScala: B1 = _builder.asInstanceOf[B1]
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class RichFBoundBuilder

scala> (x: List[Int]) => x.asScala
res0: List[Int] => X forSome { type X <: List[X] } = <function1>
```
Yes; I've written casts for just the builders we use in Scala.

I don't see how 6169 can be fixed, interop-wise, if #7318 isn't a bug, though.
I would suggest to go for this to tighten up the availability of `asScala`:

```scala
scala> import javafx.scene._, shape._import javafx.scene._
import shape._

scala> implicit class RichJavaFXBuilder[B[X <: B[X]] <: NodeBuilder[_]](val _builder: B[_]) {
     |   type B1 = X forSome { type X <: B[X] }
     |   def asScala: B1 = _builder.asInstanceOf[B1]
     | }
warning: there were 2 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
defined class RichJavaFXBuilder

scala> CircleBuilder.create().asScala.centerX(0).centerX(0).build()
res3: javafx.scene.shape.Circle = Circle@2becc08c

scala> List(1).asScala
<console>:20: error: value asScala is not a member of List[Int]
              List(1).asScala
                      ^
```
#1786 almost seems that it should have fixed this, but the F-bound case in particular doesn't seem to have benefited from the inferred existential bound introduced there.

(in 2.11.0-M3, a variant of 1786's sample code):

```scala
abstract class SomeClass2[T] {def tValue: T}
class MyClass2[T <: SomeClass2[T]](val myValue:T) 

def myMethod(i:MyClass2[_]) {
   i.myValue.tValue      // << error: value tValue is not a member of _$1
}

def myMethod[T <: SomeClass2[T]](i:MyClass2[T]) {
   i.myValue.tValue      // << works
}
```
An F-bound isn't necessary to exercise this.  In 2.11.0-M8:

```Java
public final class It<T extends String>
{
  private final T _it;
  public It(T it){_it = it;}

  public static It<?> instance() {
    return new It<String>("42");
  }

  public static It<? extends String> instance2() {
    return instance();
  }

  public T it(){return _it;}
}
```

```scala
scala> It.instance.it
res1: Any = 42

scala> It.instance2.it
res2: String = 42
```
And whatever strategy lets that automatic existential bound be added in #1786 doesn't work in this case.
Right, so we have to apply the same magic when loading Java classes, as the bound is not in the bytecode:

```scala
  public static It<?> instance();
    descriptor: ()LIt;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
    Code:
      stack=3, locals=0, args_size=0
         0: new           #3                  // class It
         3: dup           
         4: ldc           #4                  // String 42
         6: invokespecial #5                  // Method "<init>":(Ljava/lang/String;)V
         9: areturn       
      LineNumberTable:
        line 7: 0
    Signature: #19                          // ()LIt<*>;
```
Just to verify, the instance2 method does have it:

```scala
  public static It<? extends java.lang.String> instance2();
    descriptor: ()LIt;
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_STATIC
    Code:
      stack=1, locals=0, args_size=0
         0: invokestatic  #6                  // Method instance:()LIt;
         3: areturn       
      LineNumberTable:
        line 11: 0
    Signature: #21                          // ()LIt<+Ljava/lang/String;>;

```
Well, that's just *neat*!
I've just been building Slick with 2.11.

https://github.com/retronym/slick/compare/tmp;2.11-compat-2?expand=1

#1786 actually seems to be a step backwards. Before, slick left off a lot of existential bounds, but because it did that across the boards we it actually got away with it.

Now, depending on compilation order, some bounds are inferred, and others aren't. The inferred bounds are infectious; type errors spring up in other places.

```scala
[error] /Users/jason/code/slick/slick-testkit/src/main/scala/com/typesafe/slick/testkit/tests/JdbcMapperTest.scala:194: class PairShape needs to be abstract, since method copy in class ProductNodeShape of type (shapes: Seq[scala.slick.lifted.Shape[_ <: scala.slick.lifted.ShapeLevel, _, _, _]])scala.slick.lifted.Shape[Level, _, _, _] is not defined
[error] (Note that Seq[scala.slick.lifted.Shape[_ <: scala.slick.lifted.ShapeLevel, _, _, _]] does not match Seq[JdbcMapperTest.this.tdb.profile.simple.Shape[_, _, _, _]]: their type parameters differ)
[error]     final class PairShape[Level <: ShapeLevel, M <: Pair[_,_], U <: Pair[_,_], P <: Pair[_,_]](val shapes: Seq[Shape[_, _, _, _]]) extends MappedScalaProductShape[Level, Pair[_,_], M, U, P] {
[error]
```

So I can see the attraction of deferring the bounds sharpening until subtype checks.
Ok, you have me convinced. I'll revert the fix to #1786 and reopen it to receive a fuller fix based on #6169 in 2.12
