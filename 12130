The point about deprecating it for 2.12 is that we can figure out whether we want to keep or remove it in 2.13, considering that there is a lot of documentation out there which might need to be corrected (checked SO and a few other places) _and_ considering that developers can make the adjustments and be compatible with 2.11.

Due to some botched deprecations in 2.11 we have a huge backlog of cleanups already, in addition to all the changes we are not doing in 2.12 to keep the gap between 2.11 and 2.12 reasonably small. I'm pretty sure that kicking the ball further down the line won't make things easier. The idea about linters is nice, but just with abide, if there is no committed shipping date, this is not something we should or can rely on. (Ignoring the issue that it's yet another tool developers have to be aware of.)

I would appreciate if discussion could find their way back to internals in the future.
