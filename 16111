Please change the scaladoc 2 guidelines to match the indenting and spacing convention to date.

The current scaladoc 2 guidelines posted here [[https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/Scaladoc/AuthorDocs]] recommend format like this:
{code}
/** Start the comment here
  * two spaces before the asterisk on following lines
  * and the last line ending at the end like this */
{code}

The source code of Scala, even the very latest changes which include scaladoc 2 specific tags (e.g. [[http://www.scala-lang.org/api/rc/index.html#scala.collection.parallel.ParIterable]]) use the long-standing Java convention of:
{code}
/**
 * First line has no comment on it (except for one line comments)
 * following lines have one space before the asterisk.
 * The last line just ends the comment and lines up the asterisks.
 */
{code}

This long standing convention has (until recently) been enabled by the standard IDEs. (This patch to the Scala IntelliJ plugin changed this [[http://git.jetbrains.org/?p=idea/scala-plugin.git;a=commit;h=35656665c79c6fb43a46048e3bd16370f33286b0]]).

The very helpful Scala Style Guide [[http://davetron5000.github.com/scala-style/scaladoc/index.html]] also recommends this long standing convention.

There seems to be no reason (other than the fact that some people prefer the new convention) for changing the convention that is long established.  Changes like this cause ridiculous and time wasting arguments in development teams who have to decide to stick with the old or go with the new and then win over everyone involved.  Scaladoc 2 does not require this change to work.

Please can we change the Scaladoc 2 guidelines to match the standard practice.
