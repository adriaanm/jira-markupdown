Tested with 2.8.0.r17168-b20090222022952.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create Scala project with test package.
2. Add Foo.scala to test package.
3. Add bar.xml to test package.
4. Notice that bar.xml, Foo.scala (which might be wrong) and Foo.class are in the output folder.
5. Clean the project.
6. Notice that only Foo.class is in the output folder.

It's probably possible to simplify this further, but that seems like a good starting point.
As far as I can see this happens because BatchImageBuilder.cleanOutputFolders takes a copyBack parameter and at the end of the method, it does:

```scala
if (copyBack)
  copyExtraResourcesBack(sourceLocation, true);
```

ScalaJavaBuilderAspect does:

```scala
  void around() : cleanOutputFolders() && cflow(build()) {
    // Just suppress the behaviour
  }
```

We need a way to get back that copy back part of the method, I would guess.
