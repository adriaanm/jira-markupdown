I should note that we prevent direct inheritance from A[B] and A[C] in Typers:
```scala
scala> class C extends A[B] with A[C]
<console>:10: error: trait A is inherited twice
       class C extends A[B] with A[C]
                       ^
```
```scala
          if (parents exists (p => p != parent && p.tpe.typeSymbol == psym && !psym.isError))
            pending += ParentInheritedTwiceError(parent, psym)
```

The checks up the transitive parents come later on, in RefChecks:
```scala
scala> class C extends B with A[String]
<console>:9: error: illegal inheritance;
 class C inherits different type instances of trait A:
A[String] and A[B]
       class C extends B with A[String]
             ^
```
