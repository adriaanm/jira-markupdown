A few things to try ...

1. Does your project crash scalac if you compile it from the command line. If so, then please report a bug against the compiler.

2. If not, does the problem go away if you quit Eclipse, delete your projects output folder and the hidden .manager folder, restart Eclipse and then do a clean build.
