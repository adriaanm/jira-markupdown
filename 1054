Thanks.

I see the duplicated Java and Scala icons. This is a known problem if you create a plain file rather than using one of the create Scala file wizards. You can correct the problem after the fact by closing and reopening the project.

I'm not able to reproduce any compilation errors or anything close to the crash and error log that you posted.
