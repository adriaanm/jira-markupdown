> List[T forSome {type T}] is not equivalent to List[_]

It is, though.  And both are equivalent to List[Any], again because of covariance.

List[T forSome { type T }]
List[T forSome { type T <: Any }]
List[_ <: Any]
List[Any]

List[T] forSome { type T }
List[_]
List[Any]

Put it this way: try to come up with a type U such that List[U] does not conform to all of these types.
