I have seen this problem for the last two days, where the total command-line size given to the "java" command is greater than the windows cmd.exe command-line buffer size (32k).  This can be easily overcome by storing the arguments and file names to a file, and instead executing "java @file."  Attached is a diff of ScalacFork.scala to current svn, which performs this.  Note that it first checks if the user wanted to use @file for something else, in which case this problem wouldn't have happened anyway.  This works at least on Windows and Linux.

@rytz, does this look like maybe it would be a valid fix?

Thanks.
