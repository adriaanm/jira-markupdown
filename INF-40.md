The only help-like link on the create new ticket page links to TracTickets, whose entire content is "Describe TracTickets here." Is it any wonder we get so many poor quality tickets.

I could move the contents of TracGuide there I guess.  But that link needs to be ABOVE the ticket, not below it, and prominent, unmissable.  I cannot edit the new ticket template so I need assistance in this.

I'm assigning this high priority because everyone's time is wasted by these ineffective tickets and it's way past time to address it.
I'd like to add that I've been trying to close such bugs or solicit improved reports.  The actual bugs are generally straightforward to handle, but enhancements are more subjective.

For example, I'd like to close SI-2978 as invalid because [http://old.nabble.com/-scala---Forward-references-in-template-initialization%3A-harmful!-td19109777.html this thread] says it is an open research problem and I haven't heard anything since then.  However, I'd hate to close something as invalid that isn't.

If there were a policy that all enhancements should be discussed on the mailing list first and the discussion linked to in the ticket, this would make it obvious for me.  Alternatively, it would help to get some guidance on handling enhancements, even if it is "use your judgment, error on the side of caution" or "thanks, but just leave them to us".
