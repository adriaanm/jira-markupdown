Finally, I think StubSymbol was a mistake. When you remove the localizedOwner rewrite in master, everything still works, but only because now we're silently creating these stub symbols left and right to deal with anonymous owners that cannot be found. Of course this will still blow up, albeit later and more opaquely: SI-6640.

In the same PR, I've added tests to show what {{StubSymbol}} achieves. The ends are very worthwhile, are there other means?
