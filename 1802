I think this follows the spec. Type parameters of classes cannot acquire new bounds during pattern matching (as opposed to method type parameters). I think what you want is

{code}
def operator[A](sf: Base[A])  = {
  sf match {
    case DerivClass1(value) => println("this should work") 
    case DerivClass2(value) => println("and this should too")
  }
}
{code}

The above works.
