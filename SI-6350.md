I just ran that and it worked. It seems that it was fixed in this commit:

    Fix SI-4813 - Clone doesn't work on LinkedList.
    
    * Added extensive test for clone across all standard mutable collections
    * Fixed clone implementations when needed so they work.

As mentioned, Josh has fixed it in SI-4813 already.
