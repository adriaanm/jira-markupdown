I have been trying to build scala 2.8 from SVN for the last several days and the fastdist task is failing during the generation of documentation.  Prior to a couple of days ago I have been able to build scala and run fastdist for months, so this is new behavior.

$$ uname -a

$$ java -version

$$ ant -version
Apache Ant version 1.7.1 compiled on April 16 2010
Sorry:

svn update

ant all.clean

ant

ant fastdist

Oh, cool. Looks like a real problem, it's showing on on the nightly build, too:

Assigning to rytz.

I reopened #3648.
