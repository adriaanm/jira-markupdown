Attempting to compile attached files with scalac results in an error:

```scala
scalac Test.scala IntAnnotation.java Const.java 
Test.scala:1: error: annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: Const.CONST
@IntAnnotation(Const.CONST)
                     ^
one error found
```

If Const.java is compiled with javac first, scalac does not report any errors:

javac Const.java 
scalac Test.scala IntAnnotation.java


Another example: https://gist.github.com/lrytz/838709adcfb0f08eb2c5. SBT runs the scala compiler only once.
I can verify this with Scala version 2.10.0-20120511-235304-d55ea54589 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_24), which contains the fix for #2764.

Looks like another issue related to the classfile parser like #5699.
I believe this one is different from #5699:
the former is about incorrect parsing of annotation definition, while this one is about the parser not parsing java field initializer, and thus confusing scala constant evaluator.
Problem is: it's an intrusive change trying to fix this one, because we don't compile java files (just parse signatures). in Scalac, constants folding happens thanks to the type system, (1 + 1) has ConstantType(2). To make the following work, we need to push expressions through the typer:

```scala
public class A {
  public static final int N = 0;
  public static final int K = A.N + A.N; // needs to have ConstantType
}
```

Also, the way things are set up in Scalac, a compile-time constant (in Scala) needs to have an inferred type. In Java, there's always an explicit type. So we need to be able to decide somehow if the type (for K) should be inferred or not.
A good initial implementation was done by @jrudolph in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5487. A full implementation would move this logic into the type checker, but I think this could be tracked as a new issue when it comes up.
