The spec still speaks of ByNameFunction in multiple places, but there has been none such since r17415.  Section 3.2.9 Function Types and section 6.25.5 Eta Expansion.
(In r22027) Originally ByNameFunction was removed in r12607,
about three years ago.
Closes #3468.
Sorry for not commenting on this before you got to it, Toni.  There are some other updates needed related to by-name parameters.  Functions can have more than one by-name parameter and can include other parameters that are not by-name.

Line 1118 of !ReferencePart mentions "... the type `(=>T) => U` represents functions with call-by-name parameters ..." and line 5714 describes restrictions on eta expansion that no longer apply.  Presumably `=> T` was not a proper type and so it was treated specially, but now that it is a proper type, those sections can be deleted.

The syntax definition of line 1111 needs to be updated (and the summary on line 783).  `=>` is now valid in front of any parameter type and `*` is allowed as well.  The special case for by-name functions can be removed and the first case can have `InfixType` replaced with `ParamType`.

In general, I'd be happy to submit patches for the spec if it is useful and someone wants to review my patches.
I attached some patches that apply independently to !ReferencePart.tex in r22028.

1. Update the syntax for functions and removed the restrictions on eta-expansion.
I'm not sure what this part in the Function Types section means, so I left it in:
  In the case of exactly one argument type `T => U` is a shorthand for `(T) => U`.
Looking at the latex source, I think it is supposed to be rendered `(T,) => U`, implying it is `Tuple1[T] => U`.
That syntax is no longer valid however and the spec only specifies tuples for `n >= 2`.
`Tuple1` does still exist in the API docs, though.

2. Add type constructor examples to Parameterized Types section.

Three are cleanup of comments/todo that I don't think are needed anymore:

3. Remove todo for explaining that method values are equal since they aren't (and probably can't be):

```scala
def m(x: Int) = x + 3
val a = m _
val b = m _
println(a == b)
```


4. Remove comment on Tuple2 type alias '&:', since it does not exist and I am not aware of any infix alternative.

5. Remove commented section on multiple declarations that have been superseded by the relevant sections on vars/vals.
(In r22045) Updates to the Scala Specification by Mark Harrah, see #3468, review by odersky.

(In r22923) Closes #3468
