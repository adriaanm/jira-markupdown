=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===

SCALA_HOME=C:\JVM Apps\scala-2.10.0\bin\

If you create a windows batch file containing a scala program, an error is reported.

Create, for instance, a batch file HelloWorld.cmd that contains a scala program that also prints the arguments:
{code}
::#!
@echo off
call scala %0 %*
goto :eof
::!#
println("Hello, world!")
argv.toList foreach println
{code}

Start the batch file in Windows PowerShell
.\HelloWorld.cmd "foo(bar)baz"


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Output:
{code}
"Hello, world!"
foo(bar)baz
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===

Apps\scala-2.10.0\bin\HelloWorld.cmd""=="-toolcp" was unexpected at this time.

=== Additional information ===

Since to implementation of SI-5062 (Fix for SI-5062 -toolcp should be available on windows, in the scala.bat) a this problem is induced.


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0
  - Java: 1.7.0_09
  - Operating system: Windows 7 x64

In /src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/templates/tool-windows.tmpl

line 17:{code} if "%1%"=="-toolcp" ({code}

should be {code}if [%1]==[-toolcp] ({code}


this was already the case at line 27.
