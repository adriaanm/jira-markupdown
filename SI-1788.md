Consider the following class:
{code}
class BeanPropertyExample
{
  @scala.reflect.BeanProperty
  val eagerProperty = "Eager"
  
  @scala.reflect.BeanProperty
  lazy val lazyProperty = "Lazy"
}
{code}
As {{javap}} shows, the getter method is created only for the regular (non-lazy) property.
{code}
$$ javap BeanPropertyExample
Compiled from "BeanPropertyExample.scala"
public class BeanPropertyExample extends java.lang.Object implements scala.ScalaObject{
    public volatile int bitmap$$0;
    public BeanPropertyExample();
    public java.lang.String getEagerProperty();
    public java.lang.String lazyProperty();
    public java.lang.String eagerProperty();
    public int $$tag()       throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
{code}
I suppose this shouldn't happen, I think there is no reason for not having the getter for lazily constructed values.
This is because at the moment the synthetic methods are inserted, lazy vals don't have the ACCESSOR flag:
{code}
    final def isGetter = isTerm && hasFlag(ACCESSOR) && !nme.isSetterName(name)
[...]
              if (sym.isGetter)
                addBeanGetterMethod(sym)
{code}
The manipulations of flags on lazy values appear to be quite complex and I am afraid to modify them without spending a lot more time analyzing what they're doing.  Possibly the insertion logic could be changed to something more like isTerm and (hasFlag(ACCESSOR) || hasFlag(LAZY)) ... but I'm not even sure about that because the actual location of a lazy value also looks complicated.

So doing nothing for now, this is just a note for the next guy.
