Related to #2883, which was fixed by avoiding the use of extractors. Now I really need them in refactoring some stuff in the compiler, though...

```scala
class Type
class Symbol
case class PolyType(tps: List[Symbol], res: Type) extends Type

object NullaryMethodType {
  /** Creator for nullary method types.

    @note: for now, this returns a PolyType with an empty type-parameter list, 
       but this will eventually change to a NullaryMethodType
  */
  def apply(resTpe: Type): Type = PolyType(List(), resTpe)
    
  /** Extractor for nullary method types.

     @note: to ease transition to NullaryMethodType (instead of PolyType with empty tparam list)
   */
  def unapply(tp: Type): Option[(Type)] = tp match {
    case PolyType(List(), restpe) => Some((restpe))
    case _ => None
  }
}

object Test {
  def apply(tp: Type): Type = 
    tp match {
      case PolyType(params, PolyType(tparams, restpe @ PolyType(_, _))) => tp // couldn't find a simpler version that still crashes
      case NullaryMethodType(restpe) => tp
    }
}

/* error:
not enough arguments for method body%1: (val restpe: Type)Type.
Unspecified value parameter restpe.
*/
```
I'm very glad to hear that you need them! Because there's no way I'm going to iron out the extractor issues on my own in the near future.  I have already sunk soooo much time into it and when I weigh the likely outcomes of ways I can spend time, choosing between fixing fifty things for sure and extractors maybe, "extractors maybe" loses.

So if you want to make extractors "our problem" that would provide me with some new enthusiasm, but I can't do it right now when there is so much else that only I can (or will) do.
Replying to [comment:3 moors]:
> one revelation was triggered by overriding `def isLabellable` to be false like, all the time, and observe the broken code that is spat out... the condition that tests the result of the unapply is only generated for the final case, not in the else branches of the nested patterns -- this seems like a major clue

You need to read my email where I explained the origin of #1697 and #2337 if you haven't already.

The problem is in MixTypes, because the unapply gets broken up into two tests which end up separating and breaking the logic.

It should be: if (x && y) body1 else body2
but it ends up like: if (x) { if (y) body1 else fail } else body2

However MixTypes has completely foiled my attempts to deconstruct it far enough to accomplish this.  The entirety of Patterns.scala and all code which uses it is essentially my attempt at rewriting the whole thing to keep such tests together.  By the way Patterns.scala should be a lot closer to code we want to use than the rest of it, but it still has many things I'm not proud because to use it I had to integrate with the rest of it.
And, just to capture a little more information about the problem...

Leaving -Ypmat-debug out of the picture, this line crashes due to this (or similar) bug:

` case app @ Apply(x,y,z) => ... `

When any of x, y or z are there, it crashes.  But this doesn't:

` case app @ Apply(_,_,_) => ... `

And finally, this version avoids the extractor and therefore can't possibly fail:

` case app: Apply[_] => ... `
