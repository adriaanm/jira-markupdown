The compiler is doing the right thing. 

A case class with non-empty value params gets a compiler-generated copy method:

A case class with no value params get no copy method, as it would duplicate clone() functionality:

All right, the spec does not mention in Sec. 5.3.2 that no-args case classes don't get a compiler-generated copy method. 

Asking Lukas for comments (about clarifying this in the spec).
