Using Scala version 2.8.0.r19995-b20091203110322 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).

When a source file is updated to no longer depend on another source file, -make:transitive does not remove the dependency in .scala_dependencies.

Given A.scala, B.scala:

{code}
object A {
  val x = 3
}
object B  {
  val y = A.x
}
{code}

Compile with:
{code}
scalac -make:transitive *.scala
{code}

`.scala_dependencies` contains:
{code}
A.scala -> A.scala
B.scala -> B.scala
B.scala -> A.scala
{code}

Modify B.scala to be:
{code}
object B {
  val y = 5
}
{code}

Recompile with
{code}
scalac -make:transitive *.scala
{code}

`.scala_dependencies` is unchanged.  This can be confirmed by modifying A.scala (add a space) and recompiling, which prints:
{code}
Recompiling 2 files
{code}

even though B.scala does not depend on A.scala anymore.
(In r21467) Closes SI-2757. No review.
I just realised that my fix wasn't complete. For some reason we can now lose some dependencies.
For example compile A.scala and B.scala with transitive as above, add a space in B.scala and compile again with transitive.
At this point .scala-dependencies loses {{ B.scala -> A.scala }} mapping.
