Very little we can do with this without more information.

From the look of the stack trace this is a compiler bug rather than a plugin bug (although the plugin should report the problem in a more friendly way), so could you please try and see if you can reproduce this problem outside of Eclipse using scalac from the command line.

Either way, a _small_ standalone .scala file which illustrates the problem will be extremely helpful.
