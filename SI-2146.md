because all of the IterableOps stuff in Tuple2.scala is commented out.
My patch for tcpoly inference is pending Martin's approval on reviewboard. However, I think we decided to use the encoding of generalised constraints to implement map2 et al.  See TraversableClass/Tuple2 in r18056

Note: this needs more testing, as both Ingo and I noticed that using a direct implicit conversion gives unpredictable results. I forgot to write down the example, unfortunately... If this turns out to be a real issue, we could use a more specific implicit like (untested):

```scala
trait <:<[+From, -T] extends (From => To){ 
  def apply(x: From)(implicit c: From => To): To = x
}
```

`Tuple2::map` would become:

```scala
 def map[CC[X] <: Traversable[X], A1, A2, B](implicit fst: T1 <:< CC[A1], snd: T2 <:< Traversable[A2]) 
```
