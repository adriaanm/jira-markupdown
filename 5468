Here's the difference from recently working variation to now.
These signatures should not be in there.
{code}
  < signature: TE;
  < signature: ()Lscala/collection/mutable/DefaultEntry<TA;TB;>;
  < signature: (Lscala/collection/mutable/DefaultEntry<TA;TB;>;)V
{code}
The type variable E is the clunker.  It is defined here:
{code}
trait HashEntry [A, E] {
  val key: A
  var next: E = _
}
{code}
Then DefaultEntry extends that.
{code}
final class DefaultEntry[A, B](val key: A, var value: B)
  extends HashEntry[A, DefaultEntry[A, B]] with Serializable
{code}
But DefaultEntry#next's signature refers to E instead of DefaultEntry<TA;TB;>.

This is perhaps related to next being a var (having a getter.)
