Here is the code:
```scala
class X {
    def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int = {
      def sumF(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
      if (a > b) 0 else f(a) + sumF(a + 1, b)
      sumF
    }

    def sumInts = sum(x => x) _    //It doesn't compile with msg:
                                   // "_ must follow method; 
                                   //cannot follow (Int, Int) => Int"
    def sumSquares = sum(x => x * x) _  //Same error 
}
```
