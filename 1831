It works ONLY at the beginning of the file. In the example below, for instance, it won't compile with the first line uncommented, but will compile with it commented:

{code}
import Predef.{augmentString => _} // This works

object Unimport {
  val x = "x" * 5
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    import Predef.{augmentString => _} // Here it doesn't work
    // import Predef.{wrapString => _} // This line doesn't make any difference, 
    // here or at the beginning. It looks like a bug.
    
    Console.println("x" * 5)
  }
}
{code}
