All is as it was before, and the timeline has been restored in which the duplication is silently glossed over.

It might be nice to issue a warning, in case someone is actually trying to monkey with the plugin in question.

The state of the class path is not specified, so it's not obvious whether it ought to prefer -Xpluginsdir or -Xplugin:myplugin.jar.  Presumably the answer is either pluginsdir because it's either earlier on the class path or actually on a parent class loader, or myplugin.jar because I specifically asked for it.
