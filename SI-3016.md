In the following code:

> val f = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]()
> f.toArray.map { x => x + "c" }

the compiler cannot assign a type for x.  Presumably this is because toArray is defined with a type parameter [B :> A] and therefore the type of x has no upper bound.  However, in this case it should be always be safe to choose the lower bound.  For example, if I change to code to:

> val f = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]()
> val g = f.toArray
> g.map { x => x + "c" }

The compiler (correctly, in my view) infers a type of Array[String] for 'g', even though in that situation any upper bound of String would have been acceptable.
The code examples got a bit mangled.  Here they are again properly formatted:
```scala
val f = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]()
f.toArray.map { x => x + "c" }
```
and
```scala
val f = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]()
val g = f.toArray
g.map { x => x + "c" }
```

This may be due to the fact that the `toArray` method also comes with type parameters which have the element type `A` as the lower bound. This type parameter also needs to be inferred. If you wrote:

```scala
val f = new scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[String]()
f.toArray[String].map { x => x + "c" }
```

The type for `x` gets assigned.
