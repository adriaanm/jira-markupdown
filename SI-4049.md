The problem occurs using Scala 2.8.1

There seems to be a problem with the resolution of *this.type* in special cases. We use Scala to create a statically typed graph query language in form of a Scala DSL. The following is a very simplified test case which reproduces the problem:

We define a trait for a graph interface. Each graph has an adjacence method which results in another Graph. If the method is called without additional traversal information, then the result should be the same type as the graph of which the adjacence method is called.


```scala
trait TGraph
{
	def adjacence[G <: TGraph](depth: Int)(implicit traversal: Traversal[G]): G
}

class Traversal[G](implicit val graphManifest: Manifest[G])
{
	def createTargetGraph[T <: TGraph](implicit graphManifest: Manifest[T] = graphManifest): T =
		graphManifest.erasure.getSimpleName match
	{
		case "Graph" 	=> (new Graph).asInstanceOf[T]
		case "SubGraph" => (new SubGraph).asInstanceOf[T]
	}
}
```
We implement the trait TGraph in a Graph class:


```scala
class Graph extends TGraph
{
	def adjacence[G <: TGraph](depth: Int)(implicit traversal: Traversal[G] =
		new Traversal[this.type]): G = traversal.createTargetGraph
}

class SubGraph extends Graph
```

To prevent multiple implementations of the adjacence method, the additional traversal parameter is set to a default value using this.type when the additional traversal parameter is omitted. The user can then call *graph.adjacence(1)* or *graph.adjacence(1)(new Traversal[TargetGraph])*. For both cases there is only one implementation which is very comfortable.

The problem occurs at compile time within the following code:


```scala
object TypeInference
{
	def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = 
	{
		// Test case 1: OK
		val element1: SubGraph 	= (new SubGraph).adjacence(1)
		val element2: Graph 	= (new SubGraph).adjacence(1)(new Traversal[Graph])
		
		// Test case 2: not ok
		val element3: SubGraph 	= (new SubGraph)
		val element4: SubGraph	= element3.adjacence(1)		// Compile time error
		// type mismatch;  found   : Traversal[element3.type]  required: Traversal[SubGraph] Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
		
		// Other variants of test case 2: OK
		val element5: SubGraph	= element3.asInstanceOf[SubGraph].adjacence(1)
		val element6: Graph		= element3.adjacence(1)(new Traversal[Graph])
	}
}
```

The only line which produces an error is the line where the element4 is defined. The element1 is the adjacence with depth 1 of a SubGraph. Since the traversal parameter is ommited, the result is also a SubGraph (due to this.type in the default value of the adjacence method). The element2 is set to a Graph since the additional Traversal sets the target type of the method adjacence to be a Graph. We now do the same as in the case of element1 but split it into two lines. 

The line with element4 produces the following compile error: 
**type mismatch;  found   : Traversal[element3.type]  required: Traversal[SubGraph] Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.**
The resolution of element3.type to SubGraph fails though the element3 is definitely of type SubGraph. In the next line with element5 we explicitely cast the element3 to a SubGraph and there is no compile error. There is also no error in case of element6 where the target type is explicitely given by Traversal[Graph].

The explicit definitions of the element's types can be omitted and should only clarify the expected result types.
