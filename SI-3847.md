Since SUnit is deprecated, I managed to write unit tests using scalacheck.

The first one I put in /test/files/scalacheck was the Quick start snippet from http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/.

Unfortunately Partest detected this test suite as failing because it expects to find "OK" in each line of the output (which is not the way scalacheck outputs test results). Indeed "OK" is printed only when all the generated test has passed, this special line prints a "+".

So you will find here a patch that correct the test result detection
process by only working on lines that contains "+".
(In r23105) Fixes #3847. No review.
