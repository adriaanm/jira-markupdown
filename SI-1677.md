This was reported by Hemant Kumar in #scala.

The method implementation:

{code}
  /** Clears the buffer contents.
   */
  def clear() {
    size0 = 0
  }
{code}

This means that it unnecessarily holds on to memory. It should also do java.util.Arrays.fill(array, null) or something equivalent (e.g. a manual loop if the j.u dependency is undesirable). Note that this is what java.util.ArrayList.clear does, so there is a precedent.

A similar issue occurs with ResizableArray.reduceToSize:

{code}
  /** remove elements of this array at indices after <code>sz</code> 
   */
  def reduceToSize(sz: Int) {
    if (sz > size0) throw new IllegalArgumentException
    size0 = sz
  }
{code}
will be fixed in 2.8
