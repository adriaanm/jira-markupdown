I tried to get info on mailing list, but nobody asked to my question:
I’m about trunk compiler version. Seems that here is broken compatibility with Java in following case:
Java:
{{public class Test1<T extends Test3> {}
public class Test3<T> {} }}
Scala:
{{class Test2 extends Test1[Test3[Test4]]
class Test4}}

Scala compiler complains that Test3[Test4] doesn’t conforms to Test3. And it’s sad.
So it means that Java raw types impossible to use in Scala.

Java: 
{code}
public class Test1<T extends Test3> {} 
public class Test3<T> {} 
{code} 
Scala: 
{code}
class Test2 extends Test1[Test3[Test4]] 
class Test4
{code} 
(In r19983) closes SI-2750: cooking java raw types in info of type parameters of Java classes
