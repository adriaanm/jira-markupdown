The API documentation for scala.reflect.macros.Context.eval reads:
"... Known issues: because of scala/bug#5748 trees being evaluated first need to undergo resetAllAttrs. Resetting symbols and types mutates the tree in place, therefore the conventional approach is to duplicate the tree first ..."

But according to Eugene resetAllAttrs no longer mutates the tree in place.
