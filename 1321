Yes, shouldn't have closed the ticket.

I also thought of this approach, but I did not think you'd want to have different semantics for matching solely based on the presence/absence of a binding - that is, if I'm understanding correctly we're saying given this:
{code}
    case N => true
case x @ N => true
{code}
the first will match and the second won't, given the same scrutinee of L() from the test case.

I am assuming that is indeed what you mean - I am all for it and will implement it in the near future.
