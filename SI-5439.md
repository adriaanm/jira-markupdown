Using `scala.sys.process` results in file descriptor leaks in the form of pipes used internally by the library. For most usages, there's no workaround possible.

The issue is that the streams associated with each `SimpleProcesss` are not closed, and the user can't get at them. This issue has been fixed on SBT, but that fix results in another bug. I'm investigating the issue.
The SBT patch -- which closes the streams at `SimpleProcess` results in this exception being thrown:

```scala
  [partest] java.io.IOException: Stream closed
  [partest] 	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.getBufIfOpen(BufferedInputStream.java:145)
  [partest] 	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read1(BufferedInputStream.java:255)
  [partest] 	at java.io.BufferedInputStream.read(BufferedInputStream.java:317)
  [partest] 	at java.io.FilterInputStream.read(FilterInputStream.java:90)
  [partest] 	at scala.sys.process.BasicIO$.loop$1(BasicIO.scala:115)
  [partest] 	at scala.sys.process.BasicIO$.transferFullyImpl(BasicIO.scala:122)
  [partest] 	at scala.sys.process.BasicIO$.transferFully(BasicIO.scala:104)
  [partest] 	at scala.sys.process.ProcessImpl$PipeThread.runloop(ProcessImpl.scala:159)
  [partest] 	at scala.sys.process.ProcessImpl$PipeSource.run(ProcessImpl.scala:180)
```

`PipeSource` is one of the two threads that copy the output of one process to another when doing something like `p1 #| p2`. When `p1` loses its threads, that causes the exception above. `p1` doesn't know about `PipeSource`, as it is a `SimpleProcess`. The object that knows about `p1`, `p2` and `PipeSource`, the `PipedProcesses`, doesn't have a way to stop `PipeSource`.
Yes. Oops, I'm the owner of this, am I not? Ok... :-)
