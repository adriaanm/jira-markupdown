The best way to explain what is going on is to present the following REPL transcript:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_43).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.

  def bar: Outer.TypeInner = null
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined module Outer

scala> typeOf[Bar.type].member("bar": TermName).info.resultType
res0: $r.intp.global.Type = Outer.TypeInner

scala> res0.normalize
res1: $r.intp.global.Type = Outer.Inner{type Xyz = Int}

scala> res1.member("Xyz": TypeName).flags
res2: Long = 0

scala> res0.dealias
res3: $r.intp.global.Type = Outer.Inner{type Xyz = Int}

scala> res3.member("Xyz": TypeName).flags
res4: Long = 2
```

There are couple of observations:
1. Both `dealias` and `normalize` return types with newly allocted symbols for refinements. This can be verified by running with -uniqid. Do they have to do that in this case?
2. In this particular case dealias and normalize probably should return exactly the same types but they don't. The flags differ for symbols referred by those types. The `dealias` is right here.

This inconsistency causes spurious recompilations in sbt for projects with code structure as presented above.
The OVERRIDE flag for members of refinements gets set in a delayed fashion:

```scala
    def typedRefinement(templ: Template) {
      val stats = templ.body
      namer.enterSyms(stats)

      // need to delay rest of typedRefinement to avoid cyclic reference errors
      unit.toCheck += { () =>
        val stats1 = typedStats(stats, NoSymbol)
        // this code kicks in only after typer, so `stats` will never be filled in time
        // as a result, most of compound type trees with non-empty stats will fail to reify
        // todo. investigate whether something can be done about this
        val att = templ.attachments.get[CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment].getOrElse(CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment(Nil, Nil))
        templ.removeAttachment[CompoundTypeTreeOriginalAttachment]
        templ updateAttachment att.copy(stats = stats1)
        for (stat <- stats1 if stat.isDef && stat.symbol.isOverridingSymbol)
          stat.symbol setFlag OVERRIDE
      }
    }
```

Couple that with the caching of normalized types within `TypeRef`:

```scala
    final override def normalize: Type = {
      // arises when argument-dependent types are approximated (see def depoly in implicits)
      if (pre eq WildcardType) WildcardType
      else if (phase.erasedTypes) normalizeImpl
      else {
        if (normalized eq null)
          normalized = normalizeImpl
        normalized
      }
    }
```

And you get stuck with the wrong flags in the cached normalized type ref.

Conclusion: caching is hard, let's go shopping...

This gets pretty hairy, but we could selectively normalized type refs for symbols that originate from classfiles.

```scala
    // TODO: test case that is compiled in a specific order and in different runs
    final override def normalize: Type = {
      // arises when argument-dependent types are approximated (see def depoly in implicits)
      if (pre eq WildcardType) WildcardType
      else if (phase.erasedTypes) normalizeImpl
      else {
        if (normalized == NoType) normalizeImpl // source file symbol, always recalc.
        else if (normalized eq null) {
          if (sym.enclosingTopLevelClass != null && sym.enclosingTopLevelClass.sourceFile != null) {
            normalized = NoType // don't cache normalized types for source symbols, see SI-7361
            normalizeImpl
          } else {
            normalized = normalizeImpl // populate the cache
            normalized
          }
        } else normalized
      }
    }
```

Here's where the caching was added: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/7ff290c#L8R1515
We also have no idea what the caching is buying us. Here's a data point:
```
Master, "ant test" from scratch:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 39 minutes 9 seconds

Vs. always calling normalizeImpl in TypeRef:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 37 minutes 47 seconds
```
This difference is within the noise, and I didn't look at memory consumption because I didn't set out to compare them, but it's large enough that it should remind us it's a bad idea to assume without evidence that such code is helping.
