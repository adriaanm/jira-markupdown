The annotations which were in scala.annotation.target are now in scala.annotation.meta.  There are deprecated type aliases for them in the scala.annotation.target package object, but no scaladoc is generated for any of them, the whole thing seems to be ignored.  This is the case even if I put a big scaladoc comment above the deprecated package object.
