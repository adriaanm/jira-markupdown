The other advantage to reporting in stable submit order (stable if you sort within the test kind, which partest doesn't do again ATM) is that you can add an option +103 to skip the first 103 tests, or whatever.

I'm doing a test clean-up (strangely interesting exercise), and it would be nice to skip what I now know to be clean.

It's like returning the next day with your tooth brush, only to find that you have to do the urinals again before moving on to the showers.
