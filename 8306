I guess this idiom doesn't work with traits quite yet, but inlining an elided def is light and somewhat safe from accidental invocation:
```scala
class Enabled {
  import annotation.elidable
  //@unused("Language feature types are mere phantoms of the mind")
  @inline @elidable(elidable.MINIMUM)
  implicit protected final def implicits = language.implicitConversions
  //i.e., def implicits: languageFeature.implicitConversions = null
}
```
