The scrutinee is a CC and the pattern match is a CC. That ought to make it equivalent to a match on the case fields, which does warn. CC should be considered effectively sealed here even with no modifiers! It's a one element ADT.
```scala
  val test2: (Int, TB) => Unit = {
    case (_, B) => ()
  }
  // a.scala:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
  // It would fail on the following input: (_, B2)
  //   val test2: (Int, TB) => Unit = {
  //                                  ^
  // one warning found
```
