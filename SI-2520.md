Starting with a never previously Eclipse exposed source, creating a project from the source does not yield the correct package structure.
The original structure is as such:
```scala
Registrar (Standard Framework)/
  src/
    asset/
      resource/
        Resource.scala
      term/
        Term.scala
      Asset.scala
  bin/
  docs/
  libs/
```

And the importer instead does:
```scala
Registrat (Standard Framework)/
  src/
    asset/
      resource/
      term/
    asset/
      resource/
        Resource.scala
      term/
        Term.scala
      Asset.scala
  bin/
  docs/
  libs/
```
Correction, the importer creates:
```scala
 Registrar (Standard Framework)/
   src/
     asset/
       asset/
         resource/
         term/
       resource/
         Resource.scala
       term/
         Term.scala
       Asset.scala
   bin/
   docs/
   libs/
```
