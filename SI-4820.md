Consider following code:
```scala

package test

abstract class Test[A] {
  
  case object Y
  
}
```

Before r25326, badsigs.sh would report following errors:
```scala

mac-grek:badsigs grek$ rm -rf classes/* && scalac -d classes/ Test.scala && ~/scala/badsigs/badsigs.sh `pwd`/classes

```

By updating compiler to r25326, we get a bit different signatures but still broken:
```scala

mac-grek:badsigs grek$ rm -rf classes/* && scalac -d classes/ Test.scala && ~/scala/badsigs/badsigs.sh `pwd`/classes
Cleaning up /Users/grek/scala/badsigs/badsigs_working_dir

```
More interesting findings here. It turns out that it's broken for object (not case object) too. Thus the minimal test-case would be:
```scala
package test
abstract class Test[A] {
  object Y  
}
```

You'll get following errors:
```scala

mac-grek:badsigs grek$ rm -rf classes/* && scalac -d classes/ Test.scala && ~/scala/badsigs/badsigs.sh `pwd`/classes
Cleaning up /Users/grek/scala/badsigs/badsigs_working_dir

However, if I use lazy val and inner class:
```scala
package test
abstract class Test[A] {  
  class Y
  lazy val Y = new Y
}
```

badsigs.sh doesn't report any problems. It turns out that signatures of accessor method Y are in both cases the same (and correct). It's InnerClasses attribute that's broken in first case (object Y is not reported as an inner class).

Diff of javap for both cases proves the point:
```scala
mac-grek:badsigs grek$ diff object_sig lazyval_sig 
[...]
>   InnerClass: 
>    public #3= #17 of #13; //Y=class test/Test$Y of class test/Test
[...]
```
(grek in [r25639](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25639)) Fix various InnerClasses bugs.

This commit fixes two major problems:

  1. InnerClasses table missed entries
     that would close the chain between
     nested and top-level class.
     
  2. In some situations, classes
     corresponding to objects would be
     not be reported in the InnerClasses
     table.

For details it's the best to check #4819, #4820 and
#4983.

First problem mentioned above was straightforward to
fix so I won't be going into details.

The second one deserves more attention. From now, classes
corresponding to objects are properly reported as inner
classes. Also, members (classes, objects) of objects are
reported as inner classes of classes corresponding to
objects.

There's one caveat though: top level objects get two
classes (regular and mirror). Members of top-level
objects are declared as inner classes of **mirror** class
and not regular one. The reason for that is to allow
importing them from Java. For example:

object A { class B }

will be compiled into following classes: A, A$, A$B.
If we declared A$B as inner class of A$ (regular class
for objects) then it would be impossible to import
B using "import A.B" or "import A$.B" constructs. The
reason for that is that Java compiler seems to blindly
put dollars instead of looking at InnerClasses attribute.

Since non-top-level objects don't have a mirror class
it's impossible to use the same solution. Thus, in case
like this:

object A { object B { class C } }

it's impossible to import C from Java. That's the tradeoff
for fixing other (more serious) problems. It's never been
possible to do that in a clean way so we are not making
situation worse.

As a nice consequence of this change, we get better way to
refer to inner members of top-level objects. It's been
reflected in one of test-cases that is updated by this
change.

Fixes #4789 #4819	#4820 #4983 and possibly some
other tickets related to reflection.

Review by extempore, dragos.
Judging from the last commit message it seems like this one should be closed, but it isn't.

I ran the badsigs tool and it doesn't report any errors:

```scala
Root is /home/soc/Entwicklung/badsigs
Working dir is /tmp/badsigs.VG0Ed
Checking /home/soc/Entwicklung/badsigs/./classes/:
Running Main app (will generate Java files and run ecj)
```

I guess this can be closed?
Judging by the conversation, the resulting commit, and the fact that all seems to build and run:

```scala
Heathers-iMac:scala-heather hmiller$ ../badsigs/badsigs.sh ../scala-heather/classes
Root is /Users/hmiller/Dropbox/git-shared/badsigs
Working dir is /tmp/badsigs.vsQMC
Badsigs JAR is /Users/hmiller/Dropbox/git-shared/badsigs/target/badsigs-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Checking /Users/hmiller/Dropbox/git-shared/badsigs/../scala-heather/classes:
Running Main app (will generate Java files and run ecj)
Heathers-iMac:scala-heather hmiller$ 
```

All seems resolved, so I'll be closing this.
