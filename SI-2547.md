On Windows, scala interpreter does not show caret(or cursor) during left/right arrow keys are pressed.

Suppose I typing like below.

scala> println("Helo scala"

Caret is end of line.
When I try to go back few chars to correct "Helo" to "Hello", scala interpreter does not showing caret, during left arrow key pressed down. 

I can't see where I am now during move around in line. 
I hope this to be fixed.  


Environment:
 -Windows XP SP3
 -Scala 2.7.7 final (I tried with some build of 2.8, but situation does not seems to fixed)


As of 2.9.1.RC2 (and probably earlier) the cursor is visible while holding the arrow keys.

But I'm still missing usable wordwise moving.
Previous word: Ctrl-O works, but ctrl-G not. Next word: (don't know)?
Apart from ctrl-combinations, desirable is to have *ctrl-left* and *ctrl-right*.
ctrl-T is next word.  It works in 2.9.1 on osx.

Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_29).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :key
Reading jline properties for default key bindings.
Accuracy not guaranteed: treat this as a guideline only.

  1 CTRL-A: move to the beginning of the line
  2 CTRL-B: move to the previous character
  4 CTRL-D: close out the input stream
  5 CTRL-E: move the cursor to the end of the line
  6 CTRL-F: move to the next character
  7 CTRL-G: abort
  8 BACKSPACE, CTRL-H: delete the previous character 8 is the ASCII code for backspace and therefor deleting the previous character
  9 TAB, CTRL-I: signal that console completion should be attempted
 10 CTRL-J, CTRL-M: newline
 11 CTRL-K: erase the current line
 12 CTRL-L: clear screen
 13 ENTER: newline
 14 CTRL-N: scroll to the next element in the history buffer
 15 CTRL-O: move to the previous word
 16 CTRL-P: scroll to the previous element in the history buffer
 18 CTRL-R: search history
 20 CTRL-T: move to next word
 21 CTRL-U: delete all the characters before the cursor position
 22 CTRL-V: paste the contents of the clipboard (useful for Windows terminal)
 23 CTRL-W: delete the word directly before the cursor
 24 CTRL-X: delete the word directly after the cursor
127 DELETE, CTRL-?: delete the next character 127 is the ASCII code for delete

This should be fixed upstream. We're moving to vanilla jline:  https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7604
