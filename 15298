The class in question is described here:

http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.6/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser.html

the method signature is:

protected Class getBeanClass(Element element) 

when overriding from scala with the following code (from Akka -- SupervisionBeanDefinitionParser): 

override def getBeanClass(element: Element) = classOf[SupervisionFactoryBean]

The compiler typing fails wtih the following error:


[error] /Users/Oscar/Projects/dissertation/tools/Akka/akka-spring/src/main/scala/SupervisionBeanDefinitionParser.scala:64: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : java.lang.Class[se.scalablesolutions.akka.spring.SupervisionFactoryBean](classOf[se.scalablesolutions.akka.spring.SupervisionFactoryBean])
[error]  required: java.lang.Class
[error]   override def getBeanClass(element: Element) = classOf[SupervisionFactoryBean]

It seems similar to 3349 which is reported as fixed, I update to the latest trunk as of 07 May, compile my self and try to compile Akka with it but the problem is still present.
