Ah, I was thinking it says "not exhaustive" because that's all it says in master. So the unreachable warning is already fixed.
{noformat}
<console>:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: (??, false), (??, true), (false, ??), (false, false), (false, true), (true, ??), (true, false), (true, true)
           (b1, b2) match {
           ^
defined object Test
