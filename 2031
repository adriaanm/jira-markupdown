> If Scala is going to override the default encoding for the platform on which it is running, which is a pretty reasonable thing to do considering the defaults on Windows and OSX, then it should do so by setting the "file.encoding" property instead of defining it in code.

Believe it or not, changing the default via -Dfile.encoding is an unsupported implementation detail.  See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=cfd1bfd57a7b67fc37bb1713a446?bug_id=4163515 among others.

Also, this is a duplicate of scala/bug#1581.  I'm aware of the encoding situation but it's way more complicated than anyone realizes, and definitely no solution is going to make everyone happy.
