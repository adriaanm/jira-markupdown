when you're inlining you don't know that you're going to be able to eliminate the object allocation
problem: the inliner's current design first inlines and then eliminates, whereas we would have to know whether it will be eliminated during inlining (so it wouldn't be unsound to access private fields)

this would be a major improvement and is the missing piece to the efficient extension methods puzzle
