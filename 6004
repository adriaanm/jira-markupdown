(In r24962) Fix for Iterator flattening regression.  Not sure what happened,
but my theory is that ++ takes a by name argument, but doing a foldLeft
and using ++ to join creates a closure which loses the by-nameness.
If this theory is correct that's an ugly trap.

Not sure how I write a test against this sort of thing? Will take
pointers.  For now, closes SI-4582, no review.
