Another thing that might be worth considering is that "askLinkPos", the presentation compiler service for hyperlinking, does **not** create a new compiler Run, even though it enters new Symbols. I am not sure, but I think that's what we're seeing here: hyperlinking parses and enters a new Symbol for TypeTag, and both the old one and the new one are "valid" in the current Run, therefore the old one is not adapted.
