Still as of 3446dd0f72b777a4ed8011862bf0b9f8d403aec7, `src/partest/scala/tools/partest/nest/ReflectiveRunner.scala` contains:
```scala
    // this is a workaround for https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5433
    // when that bug is fixed, this paragraph of code can be safely removed
    // we hack into the classloader that will become parent classloader for scalac
    // this way we ensure that reflective macro lookup will pick correct Code.lift
    sepLoader = new URLClassLoader((PathSettings.srcCodeLib +: files) map (_.toURL), null)
```
So at least the comment is out-of-date - could you take care of it?
