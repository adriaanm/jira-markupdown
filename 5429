> I tried this a couple of days back with my original code (weaving AspectJ into Scala). First, I met with an issue that is now resolved in AspectJ nightly. Now I still see a VerifyError in the same place (class: scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder, method: minBy signature: (Lscala/Function1;Lscala/math/Ordering;)Ljava/lang/Object;)

A couple days back is probably too far, as I was still wrestling this until fairly recently.  Here is what the signature of minBy for instance looks like in the current nightly; I think you will only see the error above if you have an older build.
{code}
scala> classOf[StringBuilder].getMethods.filter(_.getName == "minBy").head.toGenericString
res0: java.lang.String = public <B> char scala.collection.mutable.StringBuilder.minBy(scala.Function1<java.lang.Object, B>,scala.math.Ordering<B>)
{code}
