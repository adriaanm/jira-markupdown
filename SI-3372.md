After I implement an interface with a bunch of abstract members, it'd be really nice if I could then declare a concrete one which extends it, attempt to compile, and have scalac fill me in on exactly what needs to be done.  Instead it throws up its hands at the first sign of trouble and reports exactly one missing member.  Pretty sure it must know about the others.  I can probably fix it if there are no objections.
Ticket #2213 reports the same issue.
