When trying to call hasNext on an Range iterator, I get the following error in the Visual Studio debugger:

A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidProgramException' occurred in predef.dll

Looking into what an InvalidProgramException is further, I found out that its sort of like a VerificationError on JVM, microsoft has its own managed code verification tool called PEVerify.exe. Fix the bugs and run PEVerify on dlls after they have been verified. It probably works ok on Mono, but for obvious reasons, I'm not allowed to run Mono :) Here is the output when run on predef.dll:
