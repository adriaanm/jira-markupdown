If I have the following scaladoc comment

{code}
/** Does a whole lot of things
 * that are very necessary.
 */
{code}

The resulting doc string is

Does a whole lot of thingsthat are very necessary.

This should be

Does a whole lot of things that are very necessary.


This can be avoided by adding a trailing space or a leading space, however this is somewhat counterintuitive, and trailing spaces have a tendency to get removed by some editors.

 * Scala Version: 22674
 * Java Version: 
{code}
java version "1.6.0_20"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.3-b01-279, mixed mode)
{code}
 * OS: OS X 10.6.3

The easiest way to see this is to open up any Scala library source file, find a sentence that spans two lines and remove all trailing spaces from the first line.
