To reproduce, create two source files:

{code:title=Foo.java}
public enum Foo {
    A,
    B
}
{code}

{code:title=Bar.scala}
object Bar {
    def baz(foo: Foo) = foo match {
        case Foo.A => 1
    }
}
{code}

and then try compiling {{Bar.scala}} while passing {{Foo.java}} to {{scalac}} (without compiling it first). No warning will be printed, even though the pattern match isn't exhaustive.
{noformat}
$ scalac Foo.java Bar.scala
{noformat}
If, however, the enum is compiled first and then excluded from scalac run, the warning is printed as expected:

{noformat}
$ javac Foo.java 
$ scalac Bar.scala 
Bar.scala:2: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: B
    def baz(foo: Foo) = foo match {
                        ^
one warning found
{noformat}
Thanks for the report. Indeed it looks like the functionality to treat Java enums as sealed was added only when reading them from class files.

See also SI-5333, a bug of the same nature.
Ok, upon further investigation of this issue:

* after adding {{SEALED and {{ABSTRACT}} flags to enums in {{JavaParsers}}, and 
* ignoring {{checkNoConflict(FINAL, SEALED)}} in {{Namers}} for {{isJavaEnum}},

we get to the pattern matcher, which tries to find
* the sealed children of the type in question (MatchAnalysis) using {{sealedDescendants}}
* {{sealedDescendants}} uses {{children}}, but {{children}} is only populated in {{ClassfileParser}} ({{addChild}}), but not in {{JavaParsers}}
