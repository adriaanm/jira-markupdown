My prototype fix for scala/bug#9630 (linked from that ticket) also fixes this one. I'll update this ticket when we get that polished and merged.

A workaround is to avoid using the same name for the case class fields in sibling case classes.
```scala
sealed trait C
case class CTA(id: Int, da: TA) extends C
case class CTB(id1: Int, da1: TB) extends C
```
