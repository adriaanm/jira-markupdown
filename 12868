This implicit removes too much type safety, and can lead to confusing results.

I think this is more important than the '+' operator being symmetric.


_UPDATE 2015-07-29_:
*Workaround*: You can opt-out on a per-file basis by unimporting it.
{code}
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _,_}
object foo extends App{
  println(new java.util.Date + " sfsdf") // error: value + is not a member of java.util.Date
}
{code}
