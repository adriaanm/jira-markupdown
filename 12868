This implicit removes too much type safety, and can lead to confusing results.

I think this is more important than the '+' operator being symmetric.


*UPDATE 2015-07-29*:
**Workaround**: You can opt-out on a per-file basis by unimporting it.
```scala
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _,_}
object foo extends App{
  println(new java.util.Date + " sfsdf") // error: value + is not a member of java.util.Date
}
```
