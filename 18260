I read the docs of implicit classes here: http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/implicit-classes.html

And these comments:

    Odersky: "An implicit class must have a primary constructor with exactly one argument in its first parameter list." I do not see a rason for this restriction. AFAICS the class can have arbitrary parameter lists. You just create an implicit method with the same parameters. 


    Suereth: Right. I was conflating value classes + implicit classes in that part of the spec.


In that light, it looks to me that this should be accepted:

scala> implicit class C(x: String, y: String)
<console>:8: error: implicit classes must accept exactly one primary constructor parameter
       implicit class C(x: String, y: String)
