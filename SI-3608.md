object Test extends Application {
  object A {
    def foo(x: Int) = print(1)
  }
  class A

  object B {
    def foo(x: Int) = print(2)
  }
  class B extends A

  import A._, B._

  /* */foo(3)
}
{code}
In this example reference foo has same priority, so we should check overloading resolution. Both of them are applicable. Let's check who is most specific.

A class or object C is derived from a class or object D if one of the following holds:

1. C is a subclass of D, or

2. C is a companion object of a class derived from D, or

3. D is a companion object of a class fromwhich C is derived.

According this rules object B is derived from object A. Because we use rule 2: object B is companion object of class B derived from object A, because we use rule 3: object A is companion object of class A from which derived class B according to rule 1.

So this application should print 2, but it doesn't compile.
