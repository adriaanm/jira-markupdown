Allowing annotating anonymous classes requires changing the Scala syntax, which is considered a rather big change.

Since one can always work around it by creating a named class, this won't be added in order to keep the language simpler.

{code}
@serializable @SerialVersionUID(1L) class foo1 { def xy = 2 }
val x = new foo1
{code}
