Martin says this should not compile, that y should not be able to be given a type-incompatible implementation.  I'm opening the ticket so it isn't forgotten.
{code}
class Q {
  private var x: Int = 0
  private[Q] var y: Int = 0
}                                                                               
class QQ extends Q {
  var x: String = "abc"
  var y: String = "abc"
}  
{code}
