You say that there is a lot of discussion about this issue on mailing lists. It clearly indicates that current behavior cause problems.

You also mentioned that it is very difficult to find solution. It is probably true, exactly as you said.

Anyway IMHO this issue still should stay open, till someone will find  a way to handle it cleanly. It's real issue as it can cause real problems in user code. Probably it will also be easier to redirect people to this issue (or earlier one) than explain everything over and over again.

I think you should consider to reopen issue.
