The methods are named backwards: `fromUTF8` converts a `CharSequence` to an `Array[Bytes]` in UTF-8 format, and `toUTF8` converts an Array[Bytes] in UTF-8 format to an `Array[Char]`. These methods, as well as all other methods in the file, lack Scaladoc. Note that the incorrectly named methods are used elsewhere in the Scala sources, so if the names are corrected (and @migration annotations added), the uses need to be changed as well, including uses in @deprecated strings in `io/UTF8Codec.scala` and in commented out code in `io/BytePickle.scala`

I am using 2.8.1 but the problem persists in trunk.
(In r24405) Rename io.Code.toUTF8 and io.Code.fromUTF8 so that the names match what the methods do, with an added migration warning. Closes SI-4203. No review.
