This might be caused by the same thing as scala/bug#127. That issue seems to be a bit different - that class is not really a GADT since has no type parameters - but the behavior is similar in that a type parameter is not being properly refined by a pattern match, so maybe it's the same thing. 

In the case I reported, it is an invariant type parameter to a data constructor that is not being refined - in scala/bug#127, it is just a type parameter to the function.
