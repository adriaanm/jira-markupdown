Some Java APIs return a java.util.List, such as many methods in Spring Framework,
and there's no scala.collection.jcl wrapper that lets you wrap this nicely.
Currently, you need to do something like

{code}
val java_list = doSomething()
val wrapper = new BufferWrapper[T] {
  override val underlying = java_list
}
{code}

It would be nice if there was a List wrapper:

{code}
package scala.collection.jcl

/**
 * Creates a buffer backed by a Java list.
 */
class List[A](override val underlying : java.util.List[A]) extends BufferWrapper[A]
{
}
{code}

Then you could write:

{code}
val java_list = doSomething()
val wrapper = new scala.collection.jcl.List(java_list)
{code}

Thanks, wasn't aware of that.  It looks pretty new, Conversions.scala
was added in r14426.
