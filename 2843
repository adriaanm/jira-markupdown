Lets try that again

Hmm... Well I can work on trying to isolate it down to a small repro case but I can't send you all the source for where I first discovered it because that is for work.

Here is an excerpt of running "javap" command for the .class file compiled by the 2.7.7.final eclipse plugin, where you can see there is indeed the $$ thingee going on:

{code}
javap -l -classpath ... RepoHandler

...

public java.util.List findModulesMatching(java.lang.String, java.util.Map);
  LineNumberTable: 
   line 153: 0
   line 155: 6
   line 157: 17
   line 158: 26
   line 178: 54

  LocalVariableTable: 
   Start  Length  Slot  Name   Signature
   0      64      0    this       LRepoHandler;
   0      64      1    repository       Ljava/lang/String;
   0      64      2    match$$1       Ljava/util/Map;
   0      64      3    repo$$1       LRepository;
   6      58      4    entries       Ljava/util/Collection;
   17      47      5    modules$$1       Ljava/util/Set;
{code}

For source code

{code}
    def findModulesMatching(repository: String, `match`: Map[String, Object]): List[Module] = { ... }
{code}

NOTE: there are backticks around "match" in the Scala source even if they don't show up the way the ticket renders.

Before I try a limited repro I will try compiling this same source with the command-line compiler and see if it does the same thing.
