I agree with your point about source incompatibility; a new method would be fine. I'd propose `Predef.const`, to go along with `Predef.identity`.

On the other hand, the rest of your argument as I understand it is: "the implementation is trivial, therefore everybody should just do it themselves." I believe it would make a useful library function, trivial as it might be, just like the existing `Function.const` is.
