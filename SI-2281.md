The code:

```scala
def splitSentences(text : String) : ArrayBuffer[String] = {
   val outarr = new ArrayBuffer[String]
   var outstr = new StringBuffer
   var prevspace = false
   val ctext = text.replaceAll("\n+","\n")
		ctext foreach {c =>
		    outstr append c
			if(c == '.' || c == '!' || c == '?' || c == '\n' || c == ':' || c == ';' || (prevspace && c == '-') ){
				outarr += outstr.toString
				outstr = new StringBuffer
			}
		    if(c == '\n'){
		    	outarr += "\n\n"
		    }
		    prevspace = c == ' '
		}
	    if(outstr.length > 0){
	    	outarr += outstr.toString
	    }
	    outarr
	  }

def spanForSentence(x : String,picktext : String) = 
  if(x == "\n\n"){
    <br/><br/>
  }else{
    <span class='clicksentence' style={if(x == picktext) "background-color: yellow" else ""}>{x}</span>    		
  }
    
def selectableSentences(text : String, picktext : String) = {
  val sentences = splitSentences(text)
  sentences.map(x => spanForSentence(x,picktext))
}
```

The errors:

kinds of the type arguments (Sequence[Any]) do not conform to the expected kinds of the type parameters (type CC) in class Companion. Sequence[Any]'s type parameters do not match type CC's expected parameters: trait Sequence has one type parameter, but type CC has one

I get loads of these, all over spanforSentence and selectableSentences.


What is CC? What is Companion? 
Update:

If you replace <br/><br/> with just <br/> then it works.
I still have absolutely no idea what is going on, but suspect it has something to do with the new, and I fear somewhat fragile, collections system.
Much distilled:
```scala
def f(x: Boolean) = if (x) <br/><br/> else <br/>
```
```scala
<console>:4: error: kinds of the type arguments (Sequence[Any]) do not conform to the expected kinds of the type parameters (type CC) in class Companion.
Sequence[Any]'s type parameters do not match type CC's expected parameters: trait Sequence has one type parameter, but type CC has one
       def f(x: Boolean) = if (x) <br/><br/> else <br/>
           ^
```
In your case it's trying to infer the return type of spanForSentence.  When the first leg of the if is <br/> it's an Elem and the return type is Elem.  When it's <br/><br/> it is apparently a NodeBuffer.

Anyway, just tell it to use a NodeSeq:
```scala
def f(x: Boolean): xml.NodeSeq = if (x) <br/><br/> else <br/>
f: (x: Boolean)scala.xml.NodeSeq

```
No question these issues are problematic.
I also hit the problem mentioned in this ticket. Without explicit :Unit in line 170 it fails with some huge, wrongly inferred type. This is an extract from scala/tools/nsc/dependencies/Changes.scala. 

```scala
155	    for (o <- from.info.decls.iterator filter omitSymbols) {
156	      val n = to.info.decl(o.name)
157	      newMembers -= n
158	
159	      if (o.isClass)
160	        cs ++= changeSet(o, n)
161	      else if (n == NoSymbol)
162	        cs += Removed(toEntity(o))
163	      else {
164	        val newSym = n.suchThat(ov => sameType(ov.tpe, o.tpe))
165	        if (newSym == NoSymbol || moreRestrictive(o.flags, newSym.flags))
166	          cs += Changed(toEntity(o))(n + " changed from " + o.tpe + " to " + n.tpe + " flags: " + Flags.flagsToString(o.flags))
167	        else
168	          newMembers -= newSym
169	      }
170	    }: Unit // Give the type explicitly until SI-2281 is fixed
```
(extempore in [r25154](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25154)) Another one I missed which was fixed by r25149.  Closes #2281, no review.
