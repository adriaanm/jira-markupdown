I strongly believe deprecation is essential to proposal #2. IMO the main issue that needs resolution is warning people about `filterKeys` being lazy. If they already know they need a strict version they're not going to be bitten by this bug (I still call it a bug, since filter and filterKeys should behave the same way, likewise for map/mapValues).
