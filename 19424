Some type does not expand correctly when spliced. We should expect the same as converting the Some[Tree] to a list of one element and then splicing it. Note that None behaves as it should.

{code}
val some = Some(q"${1}")
q"..${some}"
{code}

The resulting tree of the expression is currently q"Some(1)" when it should be q"1".
