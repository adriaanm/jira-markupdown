Thanks for looking into that. It's true that I missed {{SymbolLoader}} which is not used anywhere in this example.

Now, when it comes to reproduction I think yours is slightly different (too small). If you change {{JavaPlatform}} to look like this:
{code}
trait JavaPlatform extends Platform {
  type PlatformLoaders = loaders2.type 

  object loaders2 extends SymbolLoaders {
    type LoadersPlatform = JavaPlatform.this.type  
    
    val platform: JavaPlatform.this.type = ???    
  }
  val loaders: loaders2.type = loaders2
}
{code}

then the cyclic error disappears. All we did was an introduction of a dummy object {{loaders2}} but the cycle is still there. If this typecheck then the original code should type check as well.
