Can't assign to _ in declaration where usage in Java signature expects an intrinsic.
```scala
    var epSid: Integer = _
    epSid = 1
    Integer.reverse(epSid)
```

Error message is...
```scala
error: type mismatch;
found   : Integer
required: Int
Integer.reverse(epSid)
```
Works if you change the first line to:
```scala
var epSid = Integer.MIN_VALUE
```
