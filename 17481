Moved five methods from LinearSeqOptimized to List
{quote}

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2a2d9235

{{List}} ain't the only {{LinearSeqOptimized}} in town: that commit changed the performance and evaluation characteristics of the other subclasses: {{Stream}}, {{Queue}}, {{Stack}}, and {{MutableList}}.

{code}
scala> Stream.continually(()).filterNot(_ => false).take(2)
{code}

I've only highlighted the first example I've found. I really don't see how that change can be allowed -- even if you were to copy/paste the removed methods into those other subclasses, you would have broken any third party code extending this trait. You could take the position that it's just an implementation trait, which would let you remove if from the parents of List.

*Update*: Regressed and now broken again. See https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8627
