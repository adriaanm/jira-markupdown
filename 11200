[Type inference](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#local-type-inference) promises to infer the minimal type. That must conform to the expected type but isn't exactly that type.

When you try to handle a Nothing value, it explodes.

Inferring Nothing is especially correct in this case because the method is called doNothing.
