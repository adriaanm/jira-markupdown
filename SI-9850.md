From a test. You don't see the warning that the import is not respected because of the implicit error; unless you uncomment the other import and implicitly.

If errors suppress warnings, then it would be nice if there were a way to always display warnings, for example, under -Xfatal-warnings.

```scala
case class K(s: java.lang.String)
class C { implicit val k: K = K("OK?"); override def toString = "C(" + k.toString + ")" }

object Test extends App {
  // uncomment to show the warning
  //import concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits._
  //def x = implicitly[concurrent.ExecutionContext]
  val c = new C
  import c.k
  def g = implicitly[K]
  val k = 42
}

```
