Am I correct that the confusion is about whether "or an earlier one" is referring to "[the] parameter [that] appears" or "another parameter"? And the problem is making it clearer that it's the latter? How about this: "parameter appears in the type of another parameter *that is* in the same section *as it* or *in* an earlier one."
Or completely reword it: "A parameter's type refers to another parameter in the same parameter list or a later one." Or, "A parameter's type refers to another parameter, but it is not in an earlier parameter list."
Also, it could choose whether to say "in the same section" or "in an earlier section."
