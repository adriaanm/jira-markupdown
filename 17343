on a freshly installed machine:

https://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/jenkins/view/misc/job/test/241/console
```scala
pack.lib:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /localhome/jenkins/a/workspace/test/build/pack/lib

BUILD FAILED
/localhome/jenkins/a/workspace/test/build.xml:17: The following error occurred while executing this line:
/localhome/jenkins/a/workspace/test/build.xml:1481: /home/jenkins/.m2/repository does not exist.
```


to work around,
```scala
mkdir -p ~/.m2/repository
```
