You can have varargs constructors in both Scala and Java, but you can't annotate a varargs constructor in Scala with @varargs - you get an error message "A constructor cannot be annotated with a `@varargs` annotation".
I think this simply wasn't implemented. Original issue: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3621
Alex, do you remember perhaps?
