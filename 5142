It would not only be unwise, but impossible, to enforce implicit conversions throwing NPE's when applied to null because in general they are arbitrary user code and can do whatever they please.

Agreed, but I think my comment was unclear.  Implicit conversions do not give behavior to null values contrary to the spec, but they can *appear* to give behavior to null values contrary to the spec. My point was that any library developer (especially the developers of the standard library) must weigh the benefits of any implicit conversion against the potential confusion they can cause.
