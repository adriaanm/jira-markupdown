```scala
def foo(): Unit = {
 val x = 4 + 3
 x 
}

def bar(): Unit = {
 val f = foo
 print(f)
}
```

There are no warnings issued here (which is nominally correct) but it looks to the programmer as if the return value of foo is lost! It took me a lot of time to identify this error in my code. A warning somewhere might have prevented it (maybe on last line of foo, maybe on assignment f = foo, or maybe on the print. I'm not sure where a warning would be best but no warning invites errors here)
