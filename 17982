Firstly, the following codes compile fine while run with exception:
{code:title=May a bug|borderStyle=solid}
scala> import scala.collection.SeqLike
import scala.collection.SeqLike
scala> val xs: SeqLike[Char, String] = "abcdef"
xs: scala.collection.SeqLike[Char,String] = abcdef
scala> xs match { case head +: tail => tail }
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to scala.collection.SeqLike
	at .<init>(<console>:10)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:7)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
        ...
```scala

Secondly, there are two usefull extractors defined in scala.collection.SeqExtractors.scala. But sadly these two extractors doesnot work for Array and String, and sometimes we do need these function, especially for String.

I would like the followed codes working as expected:
{code:title=Expected Result|borderStyle=solid}
"abcdef" match { case p +: m :+ q => m } // expect m == "bcde"
Array(1,2,3) match { case h +: tail => tail } //expect tail == Array(2,3)
```
Here I got an idea to fix the issue by rewriting these two extractors as following:
{code:title=SeqExtractors.scala|borderStyle=solid}
package scala.collection

/** An extractor used to head/tail deconstruct sequences. */
object +: {
  def unapply[T,Coll <% SeqLike[T, Coll]](t: Coll): Option[(T, Coll)] =
    if(t.isEmpty) None
    else Some(t.head -> t.tail)
}

/** An extractor used to init/last deconstruct sequences. */
object :+ {
  /** Splits a sequence into init :+ tail.
   * @return Some((init, tail)) if sequence is non-empty. None otherwise.
   */
  def unapply[T,Coll <% SeqLike[T, Coll]](t: Coll): Option[(Coll, T)] =
    if(t.isEmpty) None
    else Some(t.init -> t.last)
}
{code}
