I'd like to be able to specify a jar as my output location.

Semantics:

 * If the jar doesn't exist, create it
 * If the jar exists, update it with the new .class files
(In r24840) Upgraded -d so you can output classes directly to a jar.  Very (very)
loosely based on a patch from dmharrah.  Like dmharrah before me, I see
little if any change in compile times, which I find difficult to explain.
Closes SI-27, review by dmharrah.
