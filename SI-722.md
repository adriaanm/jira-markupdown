For java interoperability reasons, the $$tag method should be marked synthetic. Currently, various tools that use reflection to "do stuff" based on the methods in a class include the $$tag method. In the case of the AXIS2 (http://ws.apache.org/axis2/) SOAP library, it tries to expose the $$tag as a callable method, and generates an invalid WSDL file as a result. Similar problmes occur with multiple other tools designed to expose classes as web service APIs.
Be careful! I remember synthetic is a double edge sword: I don't think you'll be able to implement Scala traits in Java anymore after $$tag is marked as synthetic. 

The real solution is probably to get rid of $$tag and replace it with getClass.hashCode.
