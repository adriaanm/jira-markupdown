So, Paul, I suggest that applying:
{code}
       val useMethodOwner = (
            style != Dynamic
-        || !isInterfaceCall(hostSymbol) && isAccessibleFrom(methodOwner, siteSymbol)
         || hostSymbol.isBottomClass
       )
{code}
on line https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/0bea2ab5f6#L9R1190 would fix both bugs. What do you think?

Taisuke, if you manage to test that change on top of that commit and verify that it doesn't break the testsuite, it'd be great. I don't have time to do it myself; but maybe Paul will try it out.

(BTW, I'd favor renaming back {{isInterfaceCall -> needsInterfaceCall}}, but that's orthogonal).
