It appears that way back in r17288 (march 2009) I introduced a bug in Settings, and here I am reporting on my own crimes.
```scala
// choice setting  
% scala27 -Ylinearizer:normal
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.7.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).

// correct behavior: the error message is poor because it's the same one given
// on totally unrecognized options, but at least it's an error
% scala27 -Ylinearizer
bad option: '-Ylinearizer'

// but since r17288
% scala28 -Ylinearizer
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
```
It's just assigning the default to the setting, so it's not like it's pulling any rabbits out of hats.
