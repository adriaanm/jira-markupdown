This won't happen.
```scala
class A(arg: String)
object B extends A { "foo" }
```
Now class A is modified in what should be a completely safe way.
```scala
class A(arg: String) {
  def this() = this("bar")
}
```
Now object B is calling the other constructor and has in its body a detached "foo".

Functions calls can get away with it because it can't be a class body.
