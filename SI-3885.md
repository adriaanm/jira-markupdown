If you compile the following code:
{code}
class Do(f: => Unit) { 
  def exec() { f } 
} 
{code}
You obtain the following behaviour:
{code}
scala> new Do{ println("Hello"); println("There") }  
Hello
There
res3: Do = $$anon$$1@761f9da

scala> res3.exec

{code}
In other words, it appears to be a by-name parameter but it functions as though it is by value.

I think this is could easily catch people out and should generate a compile error like:
  "by-name parameters are not permitted on classes"

No, this isn't doing what you think.
{code}
scala> class Do(f: => Unit) { 
     |   def exec() { f } 
     | } 
defined class Do

// your way
scala> new Do { println("Hello"); println("There") } 
Hello
There
res0: Do = $$anon$$1@78c4f9e6

// right way
scala> new Do( { println("Hello"); println("There") })
res1: Do = Do@4ebb21ab
{code}
Your failure to use parentheses is turning the part between the curly braces into the body of an anonymous subclass of Do.  The argument to the by-name parameter is then beloved () since scalac will insert a Unit pretty much anytime you like.

This is not a bug and is probably even in the spec, but I'll leave it open for the moment in case anyone wants to throw any good ideas around.

Paul,

Many thanks for clarifying that Scala was indeed doing something different to what I thought and for have the generosity to leave this open for a little longer!

I do think this is an unnecessary ambiguity and potentially very hard to track down as a bug.

Currently if you define a function with a by name parameter you can't omit it when you call it:

{code}
scala> def test(f: => Unit) { f }
test: (f: => Unit)Unit

scala> test
<console>:7: error: missing arguments for method test in object $$iw;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
       test
       ^
{code}

Also, you cannot omit the arguments for a class declaration/constructor except in the case we are talking about (which I think is an exception to the rules):
{code}
scala> class Test(f: => Unit) { f }
defined class Test

scala> new Test
res17: Test = Test@68e415b8
{code}

â€¦and the case of default parameters:
{code}
scala> class Test(x: Int = 1) { println(x) }
defined class Test

scala> new Test
1
res19: Test = Test@57cd6a32
{code}

I would have thought that we would provide a safer and more consistent experience if the omission of a non default parameter always resulted in an error message.  If developers wanted to be able to instantiate a class with an optional (by name) function parameter, they could provide a default.  They can as always pass a null entry by providing empty brackets.  e.g.:

{code}
// Providing a default function if use may require no parameter to be supplied...
scala> class Test(f: => Unit = () => Unit) { f }
defined class Test

// Pass an empty parameter where no default is supplied...
scala> new Test()
res21: Test = Test@4a5d484a
{code}

I am a little surprised by this last response and I'd appreciate understanding it.

I recognise that I am coming at this from a developer perspective and not from a knowledge of the Scala compiler, but it seems to me that the current behaviour is inconsistent and that there is a potential solution that would make the behaviour consistent without limiting anything that is currently possible with the language.

Are you saying that this should not be fixed because it is already being used in the 'offending' way enough that the change would be disruptive, or are you saying that the current behaviour is reasonable and expected?

In all cases of class parameters without explicit defaults, a parameter is required for the constructor with the ONE exception of this case of "by name" parameters.  This exception for "by name" parameters ONLY applies for class parameters, it does NOT apply for "by name" parameter of functions which ARE required to be passed explicitly UNLESS they are explicitly provided with a default.

When passing parameters to any function it appears to be possible to use curly brackets in any place where round brackets would be used and it seems reasonable to expect that the same would be the case for class constructors.

If you create a class with currying style parameters like:
{code}
scala> class Test(x: Int)(code: => Unit) { code }
defined class Test
{code}
a call such as:
{code}
scala> new Test(1) { println("Hello") }
<console>:7: error: missing arguments for constructor Test in class Test
       new Test(1) { println("Hello") }
{code}
fails, claiming that a parameter is missing rather than interpreting the following expression in curly brackets as either the parameter or the instantiation of an anonymous class.

Replying to [comment:7 sroebuck]:
> In all cases of class parameters without explicit defaults, a parameter is required for the constructor with the ONE exception of this case of "by name" parameters.

This is not accurate.  The issue is more general.
{code}
scala> class C[T](value: T)
defined class C

scala> new C
res0: C[Unit] = C@7b7a7861
{code}

Okay, I hadn't thought of that case, though that case seems more consistent than the case in question as it is perfectly understandable that `T` may be `Unit` and that a constructor without a parameter is going to be an implicit declaration of a `Unit`.  It is a way of saying that this class should be allowed to take any type of parameter or none.

However, wherever a type is defined which is not Unit, e.g.:
{code}
scala> class C(value: String)       
defined class C
{code}
it is not possible to instantiate an instance without passing a parameter:
{code}
scala> new C
<console>:7: error: not enough arguments for constructor C: (value: String)C.
Unspecified value parameter value.
       new C
       ^
{code}

Technically I accept that this case is not about substituting a `Unit` but intuitively this is highly confusing. Why, in a language which is providing such value in type safety are we silently inserting default values for those edge cases where a potentially valid parameter is one of 'value' `Unit`, yet in all other cases we enforce that parameters should be provided unless a default is explicitly defined in the class or function definition?

I believe that this ambiguity would go without breaking any existing code if a warning was issued in the absence of an explicit declaration of a default:
{code}
scala> class C[T](value: T = Unit)
defined class C

scala> new C
res0: C[Unit] = C@7b7a7861

// Imagining the new behaviour...
scala> class C[T](value: T)
defined class C

scala> new C
<console>:7: warning: no argument provided for constructor C: (value: T)C.
Provide a default value of Unit to remove this warning.
       new C
           ^
defined class C
{code}

and

{code}

scala> class C(value: => Unit = Unit)
defined class C

scala> new C
res40: C = C@4de77a3e

// Imagining the new behaviour...
scala> class C(value: => Unit)
defined class C

scala> new C

<console>:7: warning: no argument provided for constructor C: (value: => Unit)C.
Provide a default value of Unit to remove this warning.
       new C
           ^
defined class C
{code}
