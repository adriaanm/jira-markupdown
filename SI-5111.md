scala> (Seq(1,2,3), Seq('a', 'b', 'c')).zipped.toList
res1: List[(Int, Char)] = List((1,a), (2,b), (3,c))

scala> (Seq(1,2,3), Seq('a', 'b', 'c')).zipped.filter((n, c) => n>1)
res2: (Seq[Int], Seq[Char]) = (List(2, 3),List(b, c))

How comes after filtering, I obtain a tuple of Seqs instead of a Seq of tuples?
This is expected.  The result of "zipped" is not a collection.  If you want a sequence of tuples, use zip.

scala> Seq(1,2,3) zip Seq('a', 'b', 'c') filter { case (n, c) => n > 1 } toList
res1: List[(Int, Char)] = List((2,b), (3,c))
