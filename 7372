Please note that in your example above, the third element has index 2, and therefore it does not satisfy the invariant since {{indexOf( x)}} (which would == 2) is not < 2.

In general, it's often a good idea to have a look at the nightly docs, as in recent months the API documentation has been made more extensive and clearer (on stable classes/traits/objects like {{List}})

In this case, the API comment on the {{slice}} method of {{List}} has been improved (visible in the nightly build), and I bet you'd find it clearer:
