Future's flatMap implementation holds on to a little to much inside it's inner closure. This can be seen when just using a future, but is really easy to show when using Akka's dataflow and CPS:
https://gist.github.com/amirshim/5602245
```scala
def mainLoop() : Unit@cps[Future[Any]] = {
  while (true) {
    val fut = Promise.successful(new Array[Byte](1000000*100)).future // 100MB
    
    // This shift is the same as Akka DataFlow's DataflowFuture.apply()
    val result = shift { onComplete: (Array[Byte] => Future[Any]) =>
      fut flatMap onComplete
    }
    
    println(result)
  }
} 
```

When this code is run, it leaks because the continuation is waiting for the loop to finish. (at https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/1f4a52b4ed9457863e00fe16d18705b6c6cd5db9/src/library/scala/concurrent/Future.scala#L280) and holding onto all the previous closures.

Although this is a real memory leak in an infinite loop, it doesn't need to be so bad, especially when we have long iterators that allocate lots of memory.
If we limit what the inside closure holds on to, by introducing tempP (see below), we can mitigate most of the memory use in this case:
https://gist.github.com/amirshim/5602077
```scala
def flatMap[S](f: T => Future[S])(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[S] = {
    val p = Promise[S]()
 
    onComplete {
      case f: Failure[_] => p complete f.asInstanceOf[Failure[S]]
      case Success(v) => {
        val tempP = p
        try {
          f(v).onComplete({
            case f: Failure[_] => tempP complete f.asInstanceOf[Failure[S]]
            case Success(v) => tempP success v
          })(internalExecutor)
        } catch {
          case NonFatal(t) => tempP failure t
        }
      }
    }(executor)
 
    p.future
  }
```
