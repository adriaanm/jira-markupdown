I have the following layout of code which does not compile but according to the spec for protected should:
{code}
trait A {
  protected def callMe(): Unit
}

trait B extends A {
  protected def a: A
  final override protected def callMe(): Unit = a.callMe()
}
{code}
The compiler gives me an error
{code}
 error: method callMe in trait A cannot be accessed in A
 Access to protected method callMe not permitted because
 prefix type A does not conform to
 trait B where the access take place
         final override protected def callMe(): Unit = a.callMe()
                                                         ^
{code}

According to the spec:
The protected modifier applies to class member definitions. Protected members
of a class can be accessed from within
– the template of the defining class,
– all templates that have the defining class as a base class,
– the companion module of any of those classes.

Especially the second point should apply here but the compiler seems to treat {{callMe}} as {{protected\[this\]}}
The second section of bullets says you can select r.x only if "r's type conforms to a type-instance of the class which contains the access." So the member should be of type B. Otherwise, you could access members of other implementations of A with arbitrary behaviors for the template method.

By contrast,
{code}
object X {
  trait A { protected[X] def callMe(): Unit }
  trait B extends A { protected def a: A ; final override protected[X] def callMe(): Unit = a.callMe() }
}
{code}

I am not sure what the exact meaning of "r's type conforms to a type-instance of the class which contains the access" is then. Maybe you can point me to a site that has it explained in more detail?
As I understand it, in my example {{B}} is a subtype of {{A}} and should therefore conform to being of type {{A}} which should give {{B}} access to protected members of other instances of {{A}}.
Since both of the following access patterns work
{code}
trait A {
  protected def callMe(): Unit
  def runOther(a: A): Unit = a.callMe()
}
trait SubA extends A {
  callMe()
}
{code}
Why would the combination of the two as outlined above not work as well? Where is the difference to {{protected\[this\]}} then?
