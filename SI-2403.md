The attached program, which serializes then deserializes an object, runs as expected standalone, but complains that it can't find one of the classes (already loaded!) when running under the REPL.

To reproduce:

  > scalac -cp . SerialTest.scala
  
  > scala -cp . SerialTest

  before: Land(8,List(Road(1000,2400,4)),2500,4.0)

  after: Land(8,List(Road(1000,2400,4)),2500,4.0)
  
  > scala -cp .

  Welcome to Scala version 2.7.6.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_16).

  scala> SerialTest.main(new Array[String](0))

Summary: you need a custom subclass of !ObjectInputStream to explicitly specify the class loader to use for deserialization:
```scala
val ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(fileName)) {
  override def resolveClass(desc: java.io.ObjectStreamClass): Class[_] = {
    try { Class.forName(desc.getName, false, getClass.getClassLoader) }
    catch { case ex: ClassNotFoundException => super.resolveClass(desc) }
  }
}
```

The reason is the way that !ObjectInputStream tries to autodetect the class loader to use for deserializing.  It searches the stack for the method defined in the first non-null class loader and uses that class loader.  The first non-null class loader in your case comes from the stack frame:
```scala
at scala.collection.immutable.$$colon$$colon.readObject(List.scala:419)
```
This is because List overrides readObject and gets called during deserialization.  So the class loader for List is used by !ObjectInputStream to resolve classes.

In standalone mode, the Scala class loader is the one that defines your application classes as well and so your classes are found during deserialization.  In the REPL, the application classes are loaded in a child class loader of the Scala class loader and so the application classes aren't found by !ObjectInputStream.

The REPL should not work around the fragile autodetection behavior in !ObjectInputStream, when it seems to me that the class loader to use for deserialization should be explicitly provided by the user as standard practice.  (I don't know if it is standard practice, but it should be.)  It is unfortunate that specifying the class loader to use requires a custom subclass and is not just an argument to !ObjectInputStream.

Note that even if the class loaders were the same as in standalone, a call to readObject from the REPL (instead of from compiled code) would show this same problem because code entered in the REPL is itself in a child class loader.
