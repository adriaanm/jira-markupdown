I verified that I can put sampleTransform (a transform that does essentially nothing) between Flatten and Mixin and everything works fine. So it must be a problem in the plugin architecture. Looking at the symptoms, it seems to me that it picks up for some reason the wrong tree. But it does not seem to happen for normal phases, only for plugin phases...
