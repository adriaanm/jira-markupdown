```scala
import scala.language.higherKinds

trait TypePreservingFn[T[X <: T[X]]]

trait Validator[T, This <: Validator[T,This]]

trait Foo[T] {

  type `Validator[T]`[This <: Validator[T, This]] = Validator[T, This]

  val f: TypePreservingFn[`Validator[T]`] = ???  // compiles

}

class Bar[T] extends Foo[T] {

  val g: TypePreservingFn[`Validator[T]`] = ???  // does not compile

}
```
That's some fancy naming for `Validator[T]` -- never seen that trick before!

Both definitions should be accepted. Workaround is to duplicate the type alias, or to factor our the type constructor used for the bound on T's X.

This compiles:
```scala
class Bar[U] extends Foo[U] {
  type VU[This <: Validator[U, This]] = Validator[U, This]
  val g: TypePreservingFn[VU] = ???  // does not compile
}
```
@adriaanm: here's a patch that makes this work: https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.11.x...retronym:ticket/9337

But I fear my head might explode trying to write the commit comment. Perhaps you have a better chance at that :)
Another test case from #10186 for the same problem. This is also fixed by my patch.

```scala
trait Foo {
  type A
  type F[P <: A]
}
 
object Test {
  def noop[A1, F1[P <: A1]]: Unit = ()

  def f(foo: Foo): Unit = {
    noop[foo.A, foo.F] // does not compile
  }
}
```
