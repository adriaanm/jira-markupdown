try without catch or finally is probably a programmer error.
Warning added for 2.11. #4249 is a spec bug, we don't mandate braces around the try body.
Two reasons:

 - There was some argument that it is convenient to comment out a catch without needing to go back up in the code and comment out the try.
 - It would be a source-incompatible change.

Personally, I agree with you (I chose to make it an unconditional warnings, rather than hiding it behind `-Xlint`). But a warning is sufficiently useful, so I didn't fight for anything stronger.
