It seems `Iterator` doesn't have a two-arg version of `indexOf`. The two arg version present in other collections comes from `GenSeqLike`, which `Iterator` does not implement:
```scala
def indexOf[B >: A](elem: B, from: Int): Int = indexWhere(elem == _, from)
```

When `indexOf` is called on an `Iterator` with two arguments, the compiler is converting it to a call to the one-arg version with a tuple argument:
```scala
scala> Iterator(5 -> 0).indexOf(5,0)
res0: Int = 0
```
