I need to know what we expect to happen with case classes which have members with less than public visibility.  Right now scalac goes around it and creates a public accessor.  This strikes me as surprising at least.
```scala
class A {
  def f(x: Any) = x match {
    case BreakImpl(z) => z
  }
}

case class BreakImpl(private val break: Int) 

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(new A f BreakImpl(55))
  }
}  

% scala Test
55
```
