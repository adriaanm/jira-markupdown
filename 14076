In the nightly from March 7, compile errors in the problem log are only cleared on clean builds. Tried with a project containing the following class:
```scala
class A {
  a
}
```

This gives a compile error, of course. Delete the a, see how a class file is generated in the bin folder, but the problem log still contains the error message. Add the a again, observe how the error message is duplicated.
