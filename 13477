In testing the new support in the development build for passing Java source files to Scalac, I found that this Java source file:
{code}
class A { static Object x = new java.util.HashMap<Object,Object>() ; }
{code}
causes scalac to emit this error:
{code}
A.java:1: error: `;' expected but `>' found.
{code}

my scalac is at subversion rev 15147

(btw I'm very excited about this new support...!)
