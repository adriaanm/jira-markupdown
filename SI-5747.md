```scala
import scala.reflect.makro.{Context => Ctx}

object Macros {
  def foo[T](s: String) = macro Impls.foo[T]

  object Impls {
    def foo[T: c.TypeTag](c: Ctx)(s: c.Expr[T]) = c.reify {
      Array(s.eval)
    }
  }
}
```

```scala
object Test extends App {
  val arr = Macros.foo("hello", "world")
  println(arr.getClass)
}
```

```scala
Macros_1.scala:8: error: No ArrayTag available for T
      Array(s.eval)
           ^
one error found
```
One cannot write [T: ArrayTag], because then it will need to come from a macro def, and macro defs cannot have context bounds, as we've seen in #5744. Even if we supported context bounds and, consequently, ArrayTag ascriptions, those would transform into free terms, which are prohibited in macro expansions.
