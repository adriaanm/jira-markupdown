```scala
trait TC[M, N]

implicit object StringIntTc extends TC[String, Int]

implicit def enrichM[M, N](x: M)(implicit tc: TC[M, N]) = new {
 val foo = 0 
}
"".foo
// error: could not find implicit value for parameter tc: this.TC[java.lang.String,N]


// This works
// enrichM("").foo
```

It seems N is not included in undetparams after M is inferred as String.
see also #3346

the line that changes how undetparams is handled based on whether we're looking for a view or not:
