Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-M4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0-ea).

scala> import java.util.ArrayList
<console>:7: warning: Unused import
       import java.util.ArrayList

oh you silly REPL!
I wouldn't normally intentionally fire up a REPL with {{-Xlint}}, fearing exactly this sort of thing, but I have {{-Xlint}} in my scalacOptions in my sbt project, and so that ends up applying to the REPL too when I run {{console}}.

after only a brief moment of thought, and without any Googling at all, and certainly not any consulting of any of Jason Zaugg's answers on Stack Overflow, I dashed this off and it worked on the first try:
{{set scalacOptions in (Compile, console) ~= (\_.filterNot(\_ == "-Xlint"))}}

Its quietus is due to SI-7707 and SI-7712 introduction of -Ywarn-unused-import, but smart imports in REPL are forthcoming.
