Tickets [http://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/bugtracking/bugs/displayItem.do?id=500 SI-500] and [http://scala-webapps.epfl.ch/bugtracking/bugs/displayItem.do?id=501 SI-501] seem like they might be the ones intended, but if they're directly related to this case, I'm probably a bit slow since I can't see it.

Anyway, _if_ {{L <: A, L <: B |- L <: A with B}} would, for some reason, be an unsound rule when {{L = Null}}, then the type system is _already_ broken due to the parameterized workaround.

And by my reading the above rule _is_ already contained in the spec, in 3.5.2:

> If {{T <: Ui}} for {{i = 1, . . . , n}} and [R is okay] then {{T}} conforms to the compound type {{{U1 with . . . with Un {R}}}.

I don't see any exceptions for {{T = Null}}.
