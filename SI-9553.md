Consider this example:

{code:scala}
class MyContext
class MyContainer[T]
class MyBase[T](self: T)(implicit ctx: MyContext)
implicit class MyConversion[T](self: MyContainer[T])(implicit ctx: MyContext)
  extends MyBase(1)
{code}

It fails:
{noformat}
error: illegal cyclic reference involving class MyConversion
       implicit class MyConversion[T](self: MyContainer[T])(implicit ctx: MyContext)
                      ^
{noformat}

I don't think there is anything cyclic or illegal here.

{{MyContainer}} is not necessary to trigger the problem, it's just to make the example more realistic. The same happens with {{implicit class MyConversion[T](self: T)}}. The type parameters ({{T}}) and the implicit parameter ({{ctx}}) seem necessary to trigger the problem. Removing them causes the code to compile without errors.

I found two workarounds, both seem entirely arbitrary to me. One solution is to change {{extends MyBase(1)}} to {{extends MyBase[Int](1)}}. The other is to change it to {{extends MyBase(1)(ctx)}}.

https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-1127 describes a similar issue which was fixed in 2011.
