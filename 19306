scalac does this, and a similar one for -feature:
"there were 2 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details"

When using sbt or Actiavtor, It's fairly involved (especially for newcomers to Scala) to figure out how to get the warning enabled. They aren't running scalac by hand so where and what do you "re-run with -deprecation."

I think the motivation for current behavior of scalac is to follow what javac does. The ticket is here to investigate if we want to flip the default for Scala 2.12.x.
