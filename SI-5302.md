```scala
scala> trait A { val x: A }
defined trait A

scala> trait B { val x: B }
defined trait B

scala> class C extends A with B { lazy val x = new C }
defined class C

scala> class D extends A with B { lazy val x = new D }
defined class D

scala> if (true) new C else new D
res0: ScalaObject with A with B = C@662ad0d
```

In 2.9 the type of res0 was ScalaObject with A with B { val x: ScalaObject with A with B }.
If you run that sequence with "scala -Dscalac.debug.lub" you will see why:
```
Malformed lub: ScalaObject with A with B{val x: ScalaObject with A with B}
Argument C does not conform.  Falling back to ScalaObject with A with B
lub of List(C, D) is ScalaObject with A with B
```
So unless I'm further gone than I'm thought, the lub can't be right if one of the contributors to the lub does not conform to it.  scalac thinks that !(t <:< lubRefined), in this case that C does not conform.  So there is a bug somewhere, but right at this moment it looks to me like a bug in the subtyping logic.  I'll open to suggestions.
Closing as duplicate of #5317 ; see my comment there.
