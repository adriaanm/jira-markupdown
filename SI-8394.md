zip in the Option docs says:
zip[B](that: GenIterable[B]): Option[(A, B)] 

but it acutally returns an Iterable[A, B]. I don't think it's a documentation bug, as returning an Option would make sense.
I opened a PR for this: [#4433](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4433)
I would be happy to hear from you
