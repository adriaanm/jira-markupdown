```scala
scala> def x[T](t: List[T]) = t match { case res @ List[String] =>}
<console>:7: error: unsupported pattern: TypeTree / x1: List[String] (binder: List[T]) @ List[String] (this is a scalac bug.)
       def x[T](t: List[T]) = t match { case res @ List[String] =>}
                                                       ^
```

The error message should definitely be improved.
See also a similar sounding, fixed bug: #7877
Something like "type parameters are not allowed here" or "type parameter can't be checked due to type erasure". This error message is also ugly:

```scala
scala> List(1) match {case x @ List[String](1) =>}
<console>:8: error: List[String] does not take parameters
              List(1) match {case x @ List[String]("") =>}
                                                  ^
```
That's not relevant to the error message. The error message says "this is a scalac bug". As long as there is a scalac bug it isn't going to issue an error message about your code, because that's what the scalac bug is - that it doesn't do exactly that. As soon as it issues a sensible error message, there isn't a scalac bug anymore, there is only a bug in your code.
During a brief bout of insomnia, I mistyped someone's SO code:

```scala
scala> def f(x: Option[Class[_]]) = x match { case Some(Class[Foo]) => 1 case Some(Class[Bar]) => 2 }
<console>:9: error: unsupported pattern: TypeTree / p3: Class[Foo] @ Class[Foo] (this is a scalac bug.)
       def f(x: Option[Class[_]]) = x match { case Some(Class[Foo]) => 1 case Some(Class[Bar]) => 2 }
```
And then you start to see it everywhere, like it's following you:
```scala
scala> (1 to 9).toList match { case List(`_`*) => true }
<console>:8: error: unsupported pattern: Star / p3: List[Int] @ (`_`)* (this is a scalac bug.)
              (1 to 9).toList match { case List(`_`*) => true }
                                                   ^
```
