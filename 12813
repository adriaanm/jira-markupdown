In the new Scala Eclipse Plugin there is a severe performance degradation when a list is declared as:
{code}
  val aList = (
    elem1 ::
    elem2 ::
    elem3 ::
    Nil)
{code}
I have such a list with 28 records and it was impossible to compile! (I had to copy&paste my program part by part into the new plugin in order to pinpoint that place where it "hangs").
The workaround is to use the List(elem1, elem2, elem3) form.
