When running the scala.bat in cmd.exe it gives the following error:
{code}scala -version
'""""' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.{code}
The following change fixes it:
{code}diff scala.orig.bat scala.bat
104c104
< set _JAVACMD="%JAVACMD%"
---
> set _JAVACMD=%JAVACMD%
{code}
I don't think your scala.bat is the same as my scala.bat.

Is it possible you tried to unset JAVACMD this way?
{noformat}
> set JAVACMD=""
{noformat}
because that will result in your error.

Instead,
{noformat}
> set JAVACMD=
{noformat}
Probably future improvements to the script will occur on active branches (2.11 or 2.12), which have already diverged slightly.
