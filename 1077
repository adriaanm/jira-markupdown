Fixed in r16001

The Starr {{.jar}} files are referenced in {{${starr.classpath}}}, which seems to prevent Ant from deleting them. I found some posts about Ant on Windows not being able to delete {{.jar}} files that are in the classpath, this is probably related.

The only solution I see is to call Ant twice, the first time to build using the old Starr, the second time to replace it and test the new Starr.

So on Windows, you now need to do {{'ant locker.clean build'}} and {{'ant newstarrwin'}} to get a new Starr. On Linux / Mac, it's still {{'ant newstarr'}}, as before.
