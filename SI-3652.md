It looks like it is not possible to create a anonymous function with repeat parameters. The specification does not allow a type followed by a *.

This looks inconsitent to me.

{code}
scala> def foo(ss: String*) = println(ss.length)
foo: (ss: String*)Unit

scala> val bar = foo _
bar: (String*) => Unit = <function1>

scala> val doesnotwork = (ss:String*) => println(ss.length)
<console>:1: error: ')' expected but identifier found.
       val doesnotwork = (ss:String*) => println(ss.length)
{code}
