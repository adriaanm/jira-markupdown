Adding Spring IDE plugin (http://dist.springframework.org/release/IDE) to an environment with Scala plugin running, making Scala completely unusable. For some reason, after adding Spring IDE plugin, the JDT Weaving setting has switched to "disabled", and, even though there's an "enable" button, it doesn't enable the weaving - making all Scala files to be interpreted as Java code.

Eclipse version: 3.5.1
Build id: M20090917-0800

Scala plugin: 2.7.7.final

Eclipse IDE plugin: 2.2.8.200911091054-RELEASE
Made it even worse. All Scala files are still being interpreted as Java, and now I get exceptions like "lampion.eclipse.Editor$$$$anon$$1 cannot be cast to org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor$$AdaptedSourceViewer" whenever I attempt to open a Scala file.
