this came up in the context of Liszt:

{code}
object Test {
  class Foo(x: Meh) { def foo(a: String) = 1 }
  class Meh
  class A
  implicit object a extends A
  class B
  // implicit object b extends B
  
  implicit def mkFooA(x: Meh)(implicit w: A) : Foo = new Foo(x)
  implicit def mkFooB(x: Meh)(implicit w: B) : Foo = new Foo(x)

  (new Meh).foo("1")
}
{code}

there should be no ambiguities as mkFooB requires an implicit value of type B, which is not available
(In r21656) see SI-3340: tentative fix to resolve ambiguities by chasing transitively required implicits
Cool! We've worked around this limitation Scalaz, by splitting scalaz.MA into scalaz.MA / scalaz.MACofunctor.

SI-2781 is of the same ilk. Are you passing type constraints, too? I mean, they basically like extra implicit params of type <:<[A, B].
