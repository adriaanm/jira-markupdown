The SYNTHETIC Flag value was exposed during 2.11 but there's no reason why it can't be exposed in 2.10:

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/545ee297e785eb1092376f99f548e523b4d75831

My workaround has been this:

https://github.com/puffnfresh/scrappy/commit/9c438bdcdcf715dda7716aa97ba1fb36f85b7953

Which is obviously very awful.
@retronym thank you, I've already tweeted at @xeno-by about this problem. That's a good idea.
The same applies for a lot of other flags. My approach to transparently work around this was to store the universe in an implicit val, and then `import UniverseCompat._` of the following object in the respective scope:
https://github.com/misberner/generateUpdated/blob/master/src/main/scala-2.10/com/github/misberner/scalamacros/updated/generator/UniverseCompat.scala
For 2.11, this object is empty, as all fields are already imported through `import universe._`.
@puffnfresh, I've been thinking how to implement your request. As experience has shown, it is particularly tricky to magically create new methods in a compiler plugin, so this should probably be a standalone library unrelated to paradise that backports reflection improvements from 2.11 to 2.10. What other functionality from 2.11 would you like to see available in 2.10?
@xeno-by that's a great question. Having an unapply for TermName would be other thing but that's the only other request I can think of right now.
