=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
class CompileError
{
  final
  def addIndex(table_name: String,
               column_names: Array[String],
               options: Option[Int]*): Unit =
  {
    // Implementation Not Applicable                                                                                                                                                              
  }

  final
  def addIndex(table_name: String,
               column_name: String,
               options: Option[Int]*): Unit =
  {
    addIndex(table_name, Array(column_name), options: _*)
  }

  def migrate() : Unit =
  {
    // compiles
    addIndex("tableName", "uniqueid", None, Some(2))
    // doesn't compile
    addIndex(table_name = "tableName", column_name = "uniqueid", options = None, Some(2))
  }
}
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Expect both calls to addIndex from method migrate to successfully resolve and compile. The only difference between the two is the use of named parameters in the second instance.


=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
$$ scalac-2.8 compile_error.scala 
compile_error.scala:23: error: overloaded method value addIndex with alternatives:
  (table_name: String,column_name: String,options: Option[Int]*)Unit <and>
  (table_name: String,column_names: Array[String],options: Option[Int]*)Unit
 cannot be applied to (table_name: java.lang.String, column_name: java.lang.String, options: None.type, Some[Int])
	addIndex(table_name = "tableName", column_name = "uniqueid", options = None, Some(2))
        ^
one error found
```


=== Additional information ===
N/A

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: java version "1.6.0_24"
     Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07-334-10M3326)
     Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.1-b02-334, mixed mode)
  - Operating system: Mac OS X 10.6.7
The compiler complains about the sequence of arguments, being given as if they were a single named argument to the vararg param. Not just the second but the first callsite raises then the error: 

```scala
addIndex("tableName", "uniqueid", options = None, Some(2))
```


If several vararg arguments are given to a single named arg, how can the compiler distinguish the 2nd etc argument from being an argument to the next parameter? Once that ambiguity is removed the compiler can do its job: 

```scala
    val myOptions = Array(None, Some(2))
    // compiles
    addIndex("tableName", "uniqueid", myOptions : _*)
    // compiles too 
    addIndex(table_name = "tableName", column_name = "uniqueid", options = myOptions : _*)
```
