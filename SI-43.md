== What happened ==

I opened a closed Scala project, created a linked source directory, and opened
a .scala file therein, producing this error. Subsequent attempts to open this
or other .scala files in the new linked source directory did not produce this
error. However, none of the source files seem to be getting compiled or even
colered (though keywords do get bolded). The Scala plug-in as a whole seems
to not work with linked source directories.

The exact contents of the Detailed error message is only "EmptyScope.enter".
