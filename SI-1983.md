This fails to compile:
{code}
import java.util.concurrent._

class Bug(callable:Callable[Any]) {

  private val exec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()

  if (true) {
	  exec.submit(callable)
  }
}
{code}

but if you remove the if around the exec.submit(callable) it compiles.

{code}
class Bug(callable:Callable[Any]) {

  private val exec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool()

  exec.submit(callable)
}
{code}

The error is: found   : java.util.concurrent.Callable[Any] required: java.lang.Runnable exec.submit(callable)

Seems like two identical tickets were submitted by mistake, marking as duplicate of ticket SI-1982 .
