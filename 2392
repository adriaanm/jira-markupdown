Setting the heap settings as recommended at http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94 fixes this problem for me.

The default Eclipse heap configuration is often inadequate for the Scala IDE. It is strongly recommended that you edit your Eclipse config.ini to add the following lines increasing various heap limits and VM options,

--launcher.XXMaxPermSize
256m
-vmargs
-Xms256m
-Xmx1024m
-XX:PermSize=64m
-Xss1M
-server
-XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
