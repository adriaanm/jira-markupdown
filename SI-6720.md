When the following function is called:

```scala
object ScalaBug {
  def bug() = {
    val optA: Option[String] = Some("A")
    val optB: Option[Int] = Some(2)

    optA.map(concept => {
      var foo = "A"

      optB match {
        case Some(max) => (max to 1 by -1).foreach { _ => foo = "B" }
        case None => foo = "C"
      }

      foo
    })
  }
}
```

It result in this runtime exception:
*java.lang.VerifyError: Uninitialized object exists on backward branch 92 in method com.timeout.service.test.ScalaBug$.bug()Lscala/Option; at offset 114*
Minimized:

```
object Test {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {  }
  
  def problematic(r: Range) {
    Some( r foreach null )
  }

}
```
Pretty-fying somewhat the ICode (right after inliner) for the above:

```
  def problematic(r: collection.immutable.Range (REF(class Range))): Unit {
  locals: value r, variable loc41, variable loc31, variable loc21
  startBlock: 1
  blocks: [1,4,5,6,7]
  
  1: 
     	NEW REF(class Some)
     	DUP(REF(class Some))
     	(r.validateRangeBoundaries(null) == 0) ? JUMP 4 : JUMP 7
    
  7: 
     	loc21 = r.start
     	loc31 = r.terminalElement
     	loc41 = r.step
    
  5: 
     	(loc21 == loc31) ? JUMP 4 : JUMP 6
    
  4: 
     	LOAD_FIELD scala.runtime.BoxedUnit.UNIT
     	CALL_METHOD scala.Some.<init> (static-instance)
     	DROP REF(class Some)
     	RETURN(UNIT)
    
  6: 
     	CONSTANT(null)
     	LOAD_LOCAL(variable loc21)
     	BOX INT
     	CALL_METHOD scala.Function1.apply (dynamic)
     	DROP INT
        loc21 = loc21 + loc41
     	JUMP 5
    
  }
```
Minimized further, showing  that `-optimise` isn't required:

```
object Test {

  def main(args: Array[String]) { 

    Some( while(this != null) {} )

  }

}
```

Error message:

```

Quoting from the JVM Spec, 4.9.2 Structural Constraints , http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html

```
- There must never be an uninitialized class instance on the operand stack or in a local variable at the target of a backwards branch unless the special type of the uninitialized class instance at the branch instruction is merged with itself at the target of the branch (ยง4.10.2.4).

- There must never be an uninitialized class instance in a local variable in code protected by an exception handler (ยง4.10.2.4).

- There must never be an uninitialized class instance on the operand stack or in a local variable when a jsr or jsr_w instruction is executed.
```

The first constraint applies in our case, and in fact appears the bytecode should be accepted. There's been recent work on HotSpot to make VerifyErrors more informative, perhaps an unintended result of that work was checking a more stringent condition than required by the spec.

```

Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_03-b04)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 22.1-b02, mixed mode)
```
The verifier in two other VMs also complains: in the Graal VM (same error as in HotSpot JDK7) and also in HotSpot JDK8:

The Oracle JVM as of JDK 7 has started rejecting bytecode of the form:

```scala
NEW x
DUP
... instructions loading ctor-args, involving a backedge
INVOKESPECIAL <init>
```

The above can be detected bytecode-level, and solved bytecode-level by reformulating into:

```scala
... instructions loading ctor-args, involving a backedge
STORE nth-arg
...
STORE 1st-arg
NEW x
DUP
LOAD 1st-arg
...
LOAD nth-arg
INVOKESPECIAL <init>
```

After rewriting `NEW x` runs after the code to compute arguments, but it's that behavioral change or `VerifyError`

To implement the above, an ASM utility computing usage-definition and definition-usage webs is needed. That's already available for the experimental optimizer I've been working on (that utility is called `ProdConsAnalyzer`. The rewriting described above is implemented by:

```scala
private def avoidBackedgesInConstructorArgs(cnode: ClassNode) {
```

@JamesIry, now that I think of it, this bug is related to the try/catch lifting discussion.
It's weird but on

```
java version "1.7.0_15"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_15-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)
```

I can't reproduce anymore.
