This issue has been uncovered when I replaced LiftCode with scala.reflect.api.macro.Context#reify. My activity also involved removing scala.reflect.Code, but I couldn't do this right away, because that led to crashes of starr, so I left Code in place (until I get chance to replace a starr), and moved along.

The next step was fixing tests, since there were 40+ tests that used Code.lift to test reification. I decided to play smart and rolled my own Code.lift with lift being a macro calling shiny new reify. Then I packed the macro into code.jar and put it on library classpath before scala-library.jar (that still contained old and deprecated Code.lift). I was enjoying my wit until the tests went crashing. Apparently, there were some classloading issues, let's take a look:

{code}
lazy val mirror = new scala.reflect.runtime.Mirror {
  lazy val libraryClassLoader = {
    val classpath = global.classPath.asURLs
    ScalaClassLoader.fromURLs(classpath, self.getClass.getClassLoader)
  }

  override def defaultReflectiveClassLoader() = libraryClassLoader
}
{code}

After inserting debug prints, I found out that self.getClass.getClassLoader didn't contain any references to my code.jar. Consequently, libraryClassLoader went to scala-library.jar (parent first!), loaded the old Code class and, of course, it didn't find any macros there. This is inconsistent with how library classpath works and should be fixed.
Still as of 3446dd0f72b777a4ed8011862bf0b9f8d403aec7, {{src/partest/scala/tools/partest/nest/ReflectiveRunner.scala}} contains:
{code}
    // this is a workaround for https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5433
    // when that bug is fixed, this paragraph of code can be safely removed
    // we hack into the classloader that will become parent classloader for scalac
    // this way we ensure that reflective macro lookup will pick correct Code.lift
    sepLoader = new URLClassLoader((PathSettings.srcCodeLib +: files) map (_.toURL), null)
{code}
So at least the comment is out-of-date - could you take care of it?
