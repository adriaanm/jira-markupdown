"They seem to be letting part of the type (namely its stability) escape into an outer lexical scope, which definitely seems iffy."

Why is that a problem? The "lexical" in "lexical scope" tells you what scopes are about: names. When properties of the value which can be expressed in the type without reference to its name are visible outside of the defining scope, that is the type system doing its job. That's what a type system is for.
