In this unit test, {{methodLift}} fails, while {{asFunction}} passes.
{code:scala}
@Test
def methodLift {
    def isPrime(c: Int) = BigInt(c).isProbablePrime(1)
  assertNoOuter(isPrime)
}
@Test
def asFunction {
  val isPrime = (c: Int) => BigInt(c).isProbablePrime(1)
  assertNoOuter(isPrime)
}
private def assertNoOuter(f: Int => Boolean) {
  assertFalse(f.getClass.getDeclaredFields.exists(_.getType == this.getClass))
}
{code}
This is actually not a bug. The reason is that the lambda body of the eta-expansion of {{isPrime}} invokes the {{isPrime}} method, which is an instance method, so the lambda needs to capture the {{C}} instance.

The class

{code}
class C {
  def methodLift = {
    def isPrime(c: Int) = BigInt(c).isProbablePrime(1)
    val f: Int => Boolean = isPrime
    f(0)
  }
}
{code}

compiles to (with delambdafy:method, indylambda)

{code}
class C {
  def anonfun$1(i: Int) = this.isPrime$1(i)
  def isPrime$1(i: Int) = BigInt(c).isProbablePrime(1)
  def methodLift = {
    // lambda captures `this`, in order to be able to invoke the instance method `anonfun$1`
    val f = indyLambda(this, MethodHandle(anonfun$1))
    f.apply(0)
  }
}
{code}
Maybe the optimizer could fix this in some cases: if we inline {{isPrime$1}} into {{anonfun$1}} then we can get rid of the captured value. Logged here: https://github.com/scala-opt/scala/issues/34
In fact, the lifted {{isPrime$1}} method could be made static, or moved to the companion object, that would also fix the issue. Somewhat related to SI-4581.
I just tried to {{@inline}} the {{def}}, but unfortunately that didn't work either. Not sure if it should or not.
