Maybe it is time to revisit this? One of key syntactic conveniences of Scala is that try returns a value. But sadly it does not work conveniently with val's:

{code}val x  = try {
 val context = context()...
} catch {
 no access to context!
}{code}
We can solve it easily with re-assignment:

{code}var context ...
val x = try {
 context = ...
} catch {
 context is available here
}
{code}
but val is much nicer...

Implementation-wise, why can't we emit a block around every try, and place all variables defined inside try into this block?
{code}
{
 var context...
 val x = try {
  context = ...
 } catch {
  context is available here
 }
}
context is out of scope here
{code}
