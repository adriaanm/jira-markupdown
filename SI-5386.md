import pets._

val pets = List()

Complains about a cyclic dependency. Problem doesn't happen if you :load the program into the REPL
:load runs the commands one-by-one, as though you entered them individually. That's why you get "error: not found: value pets", followed by a successful evaluation of the second line.

But in a regular block of code, {{import x._; val x = ...}} is not valid.
