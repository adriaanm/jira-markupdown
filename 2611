Thanks for the comment. It looked like it might be desirable to have a custom folding structure provider because {{org.eclipse.jdt.ui.text.folding.DefaultJavaFoldingStructureProvider}} seems closely tied to Java language structure and sooner or later we might find it unsuitable for Scala. It might also be difficult to work around this Java coupling by just overriding 
{{protected void computeFoldingStructure(IJavaElement element, FoldingStructureComputationContext ctx)}} 
because {{FoldingStructureComputationContext}} is inaccessible from Scala code -- or at least I can't find a way to access it.

Anyway, I'll be happy to look at solving this using multiple {{ImportContainers}} -- another learning opportunity!
