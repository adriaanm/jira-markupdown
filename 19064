Calling {{interpret}} sets the current thread's context classloader, but fails to reset it to its previous state when returning from that method.

The following workaround illustrates the problem:

{code}
    val th = Thread.currentThread()
    val cl = th.getContextClassLoader
    try {
      imain.interpret(text)
    } finally {
      th.setContextClassLoader(cl)
    }
{code}

Jason Zaugg suggests that the following might be the regression: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/3a30af1#diff-36a995091016ecd5cdb97e267764e05aL538
