Ah I see.

Well, we have to make those changes for some other distributions, so bundling mac in the package isn't an issue.  I could also generate you a **specific** mac tgz to download in homebrew too.   Time is the only limit here.  

I'm going to be re-bundling the tool-support for Scala into the typesafe repositories shortly.  This means I'll be able to `yum install scala-bash-completion` and `apt-get install scala-gedit-support`, etc.  I'd love to have a quick & easy path to support macports for that.

Should we start a scala-dist mailing list to discuss these issues?
