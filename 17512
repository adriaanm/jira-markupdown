An offset into the string you are parsing. I looked at the 
implementation and it seems you would have to reoffset stuff because 
of the wrapper. But I think that would be the most useful. The macro 
using `parse` would then have to offset all the positions by a certain 
amount. 

Aside from that maybe another parsing function would be useful which 
takes an original String literal tree and a string range inside of 
that literal and then uses this information to correctly assign 
positions in relation to the original source of the string.
