Inferring a more specific type than currently would break at least programs where that type is used in a non-positive position, in particular vars and type arguments to non-covariant type parameters.

Personally, I think it's a bad idea to infer a type into a non-positive position from a positive occurrence (i.e. the type of a value), and wouldn't mind requiring explicit type annotations/arguments for such situations, if that would make inference into positive positions work better. Granted, this would make local vars less practical, but personally I don't see much reason to make imperative programming too easy. :)
