[urgh -- why can't I edit my comments... here's the text that shouldn't have gone in that code block]

so `typedThis` doesn't actually type check those (qualifiyingClass has a shortcut in case the tree's symbol is already set), but `resetAllAttrs`, which is called in the adapt case I mentioned in an earlier comment, resets the type for these trees so that now they will have to be type checked

should typedThis be made more resilient? should these `This(pkg)` trees never be generated in the first place? ([http://github.com/adriaanm/scala/commit/4d2432b48caaa41217fb46f11b6f90663ac146c7 I tried that], but a locker that does that fails in quick.lib in mysterious ways that probably have something to do with stepping on the toes of bootstrapping and Predef)
