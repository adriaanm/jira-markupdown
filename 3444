Works for me with trunk (didn't test RC7, but I don't think anything has changed related to classpaths).

I had to change
{code}
class Foo(name: String)
{code}
to
{code}
class Foo(val name: String)
{code}
to fix a compile error.

If you still think there is still an issue, it would help to post the exact error message you get (use `{{` and `}}` to delimit code blocks).
