The 2.7.3-final compiler fails on the following code with "java.lang.Error: no-symbol does not have owner":

```scala
import java.util.Properties
import javax.mail.{Message, Session}
import javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage

object CompilerTest extends Application {    
    val session = Session.getInstance(new Properties(), null)
    val msg = new MimeMessage(session)
    msg.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, "to")
}
```

This code compiled successfully under 2.7.1 (I did not try 2.7.2).
I am glad the submitter was able to work around it, but this is surely not an invalid bug.  It demonstrates an easy way to crash scala with (unless you know otherwise) perfectly valid bytecode, from a jar which (not that it should matter) is in very wide use.

I have so far been frustrated in my attempts to reproduce it in a small test case, but I can point the finger with reasonable accuracy based on the following debugging output:
```scala
[...]
Set staticModule for class Part to object Part
Set staticModule for class MimePart to object MimePart
Set staticModule for class InputStream to object InputStream
Set staticModule for class RecipientType to object RecipientType
Set staticModule for class Message$$RecipientType to <none>
```
In other words, because of the statics in the inner class it expects a companion object, but that is not being created so linkedModuleOfClass returns NoSymbol.

Who is responsible for the classfile parsing code, is it Iulian perhaps? Can whoever it is take a look at this please? I am attaching the mail.jar and activation.jar which induce the bug, in case the submitter's link stops working.
That reminds me that I wanted to have static fields on inner objects with scala (see #1493). ;-)
