My previous assumption that there are situations where a manually written {{apply}} can replace the auto-generated one seems to be wrong. That is tracked by SI-9547. In this case it looks like a simple bug, i.e. writing two methods that differ only in the presence of an implicit parameter is allowed, but writing one and having the other auto-generated causes an error.
