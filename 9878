DAMN, yes EDITOR was not unset. It pointed to vim which couldn't be loaded. After I unset the variable everything works fine.

I'll close the ticket but if you want you can take a look at the exception that occurs when EDITOR points to an editor that does not exist:

{quote}
java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "": error=2, No such file or directory
{quote}
