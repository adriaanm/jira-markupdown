_this_ is a stable identifier (one of the stablest IMHO) and qualifing it with backticks should work in pattern matches, but currently doesn't:

{code}
scala> new AnyRef { this match { case `this` => println("foo") } }
<console>:27: error: not found: value this
              new AnyRef { this match { case `this` => println("foo") } }

{code}
