I think this is not just inadequate documentation.  It's a bug.  I am a little hesitant to fix it in 2.11 since it is possible that someone depended on this behavior.  It's totally safe for 2.12, and arguably buggy enough that 2.11 should have it.  I'm going to let someone else (who has to deal with the consequences of it being more problematic than anticipated) make the call of where the fix should go.  @SethTisue, do you want to call this one?

It's an easy fix.  The harder part is to decide where to put it.
