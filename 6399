(extempore in [r25410|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25410]) Added two new compiler options:

  -Ywarn-adapted-args   // also included in -Xlint
  -Yno-adapted-args

The former warns when a () is inserted or an argument list is implicitly
tupled. The latter errors under the same conditions. Using these options
I found several bugs in the distribution which would otherwise be nearly
impossible to spot. These bugs were innocuous (I think) but similar bugs
could easily be (and have been) otherwise.

Certain particularly threatening scenarios are at minimum warned about
regardless of options given.  Closes SI-4851, no review.
