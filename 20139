The attached Java-classes contain a valid Annotation in TestAnnotation which is used in AnnotationTest.

Compiling with javac works using the following commandline:
*javac -d classes **.java**

Compiling with scalac breaks using the following commandline:
*scalac -d classes **.java**
```scala
AnnotationTest.java:4: error: illegal start of type
    public void testMethod(List<@TestAnnotation String> annotatedList);
                                ^
AnnotationTest.java:5: error: `>' expected but `}' found.
}
^
two errors found
```

This might be related to [SI-8056](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8056), I am posting it anyway as I think this shouldn't break compiling Java-classes.
