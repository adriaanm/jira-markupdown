If I follow the warning recommendation and move a class out of a package object, then recompile without cleaning, I get a generic, tautological error message:
```scala
pkgobjection.scala:9: error: NoLongerImplementedError is already defined as class NoLongerImplementedError
```
It would be nicer to specify: "...as class NoLongerImplementedError in package object pkgobjection."

I've read and understood scala/bug#4344, and I've read and misunderstood scala/bug#4695.

The spec says I should never (for now) let this happen, and maybe it doesn't in a tooled environment.
