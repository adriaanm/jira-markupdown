Note that there are two test cases with distinct errors in https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/attachment/ticket/2429/2429.scala that I extracted from Lift. The second one indeed looks like scala/bug#2175. The first manifests a bit earlier, but may they may well be brethren.

Of some puzzlement is the way the behavior changes when a type annotation of Seq[T] is added.

Also, In case the resemblance is lost, TSeq in the test cases corresponds to usages of NodeSeq in Lift.
