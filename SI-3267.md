I have a Java class that has a constructor like this:

public EventImpl(String cacheName, CacheManager cacheManager, Type type, List<Address> newMemberList, List<Address> oldMemberList, Address localAddress, int viewId) {
...
}

where Type is an Java annotation defined within a Java interface. For example:

public interface Event {
   public enum Type {
      CACHE_STARTED, CACHE_STOPPED, VIEW_CHANGED
   }
...

Now, whenever I try to create a brand new instance of this class from scala, i.e.

val event = new EventImpl("", new DefaultCacheManager, Event.Type.VIEW_CHANGED, asList(newMembers), asList(newMembers), addr2, 0)

I keep getting this compilation error message related to the original java class:

"error: not found: type Type
public EventImpl(String cacheName, CacheManager cacheManager, Type type, List<Address> newMemberList, List<Address> oldMemberList, Address localAddress, int viewId) {"

This looks like a bug. This is present in Scala 2.8.0.Beta1
Yeah, I meant enumeration. I agree that it sounds like it comes from javac but this error **does not** appear if I don't create an instance of this class in scala. This java class is used in the java part of the app and generates no error. I ended up getting around the need for instantiating this class. If it appears again, I'll try to narrow it down. Thx
