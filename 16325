For the following code, scaladoc should either expand Y, link to Y, and/or show what Y expands to as a tooltip.  At a minimum, it should show the prefix. 

{code}
object Q {
	type Y = Int
}
object X {
	def x(y: Q.Y) = y
} 
{code}

Currently, it displays the `x` method without links as `def x(y: Y): Y`

This is related to the Enumeration.Value issue, SI-3314.
