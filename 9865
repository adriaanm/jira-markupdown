From a ticket marked as a duplicate:

{code}package p1;
public class EnclosingClass {
    public class NestedClass {
    }
}
import p1.EnclosingClass.NestedClass;
public class ConsumingClass {
    NestedClass nc;
}
{code}

This results in:
```
NestedClass is not a member of _root_.p1.EnclosingClass.
```
