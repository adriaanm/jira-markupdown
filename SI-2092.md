No don't close it as invalid -- they're not actually in different locations, they are in the same physical location.  

`/path/to/bin-dir/../lib` always works in the case where bin and lib are stored together, as they always would be after unpacking the scala distribution;

I can't think of any reasonable case where `/path/to/bin-dir-link/../lib` (the current behavior) would be what you want.  It would mean some structure like:

```scala
/path/to/link/bin -> /path/to/scala/bin
/path/to/link/lib -> /path/to/scala/lib   
# why are you rebuilding all the root level links?
```
or
```scala
/path/to/link/bin -> /path/to/scala/bin
/path/to/link/lib  (physical directory)
or 
/path/to/link/lib -> /path/to/otherscala/lib
# mixing and matching different bin and lib dirs??
```
Even if you are trying to mix and match different components, just put them in the same physical directory, and `/path/to/chimera-scala/bin/../lib` will still work fine.

The reason I noticed this at all is that at my school, where we have a single home directory shared across machines of varied platforms (irix/sunos/solaris/redhat/ubuntu) which generally can't share binaries, I have an unusual setup where my path is built based on symlinks in the filesystem:

`env/<arch>/path/<entries> ->` various bin dirs
where `<arch>` is selected according to the current machine architecture

for example:
```scala
<path>/eclipse-3.4-x86_64 -> /net/hc295/arya/links/hd22-home/software/eclipse/eclipse-3.4-x86_64
<path>/jdk1.6.0_03 -> /net/hd22/pfunk/devtools/jdk1.6.0_03/bin/
<path>/scala-2.8 -> /net/hc295/arya/scala-2.8.0.r18093-b20090624020115/bin/
```
I know it's a weird situation, but scala is the first program I've run into trouble with on this.  i.e. eclipse and javac both find their respective libraries fine.

Specifically, javac **is** looking for its libraries relative to the physical path to itself.  Maybe the right fix is to look in both paths as you suggested (I'm not sure), but as long as we only support one or the other, I suggest switching it up, like Sun has.  See:
```scala
[arya@drfunkenstein tmp4]$$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 arya stud 24 2009-06-30 12:41 bin -> ../tmp3/jdk1.6.0_03/bin/
[arya@drfunkenstein tmp4]$$ bin/javac -version
javac 1.6.0_03
[arya@drfunkenstein tmp4]$$ mv `realpath bin`/../lib/ .
`../tmp3/jdk1.6.0_03/lib/' -> `./lib'
[arya@drfunkenstein tmp4]$$ ls -l
total 8
lrwxrwxrwx 1 arya stud  24 2009-06-30 12:41 bin -> ../tmp3/jdk1.6.0_03/bin/
drwxr-xr-x 2 arya pfunk 72 2007-11-03 20:25 lib
[arya@drfunkenstein tmp4]$$ bin/javac -version

```
Actually I didn't realize the fix was so straightforward:

```

...and similarly in the other scripts where SCALA_HOME is initialized.
I have not read all the details of this thread, but in any case `readlink` won't help much in that position: it will fail if the argument is a real dir rather than a link and your `pwd` will return the home dir :-). However, changing the `pwd` to `pwd -P` will resolve all the symbolic links, which is probably what you want. This should work:
```scala
  SCALA_HOME="$$(cd "$$(cd $$(dirname "$$SOURCE"); pwd -P)"/..; pwd)"
```
or, in simpler steps:
```scala
  SCALA_HOME=`dirname "$$SOURCE"`
  SCALA_HOME=`cd "$$SCALA_HOME"; pwd -P`
  SCALA_HOME=`cd "$$SCALA_HOME"/..; pwd`
```
missed a pair of quotes (to deal with those pesky whitespaces in file names):
```scala
  SCALA_HOME="$$(cd "$$(cd "$$(dirname "$$SOURCE")"; pwd -P)"/..; pwd)"
```
I am afraid `readlink` is not very portable: neither of the options you mention exist on BSD/OSX. Using `pwd -P` seems safer, as it is actually a bash/sh builtin command. I will commit a patch accordingly shortly.
(extempore in [r25994](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25994)) Working on the runners.

Removed assumption that bash is in /bin. Removed --posix option to bash.
Modernized shell constructs: $() instead of ``, [[ ]] instead of [ ].
Added -debug option for all runners which will show you the exact java
command line being run before running it. Added -usebootcp to complement
-nobootcp, and made regular classpath the default on cygwin. Quoted more
things to give us a fighting chance against spaces and parens in paths.

I took the waste-half-a-day step of installing vmware fusion so I could
install windows so I could install cygwin so I could install scala under
cygwin so I could see if it still worked. Seems to. We still desperately
need some way of testing not only everything I'm attempting to address
in this pile of patches but everything which is most likely now regressing.

:javap now sort of works on windows (not for repl-defined classes as yet)
if JAVA_HOME is set such that I can find tools.jar. Closes #4959.
(Risks breaking and) references #2092. References #622 since that
shouldn't be hard to get working.
