I don't know if this is the right place to report it, but this code demonstrates an issue when path dependent types are used as type parameters for generic types:

{code}
	trait SubtypeOf[+T] {
		type Type <: T
	}

	def SubtypeOf[T] :SubtypeOf[T] = new SubtypeOf[T] { type Type = T }

	case class Owned[+P<:Owner](next :Option[P#R])

	class Owner {
		type This = this.type
		val R = SubtypeOf[Owned[This]]
		type R = R.Type

		def next(o :Owned[this.type]) :Owned[This] = o.next.get
	}

	object Owner extends Owner

	def compiles(o :Owned[Owner.type]) :Owned[Owner.type] = o.next.get

	def fails(o :Owned[Owner.type]) :Owned[Owner.type] = o.next.get.next.get

	def fix(o :Owned[Owner.type]) :Owned[Owner.type] = (o.next.get :Owned[Owner.type]).next.get
{code}

This is not as academic as it might look, the code is derived from an attempt to create 'type boxes' grouping declarations of related types. So Owned is in fact a couple of dozen classes forming a component tree, where properties of those classes can be of types declared by passed Owner. This way one can duplicate a component hierarchy to add minor changes by simply overriding a type definition in Owner. SubtypeOf is a workaround to allow 'overridable covariant type declarations', so that adding a new component hierarchy would require only overriding changed types, instead of defining all types from scratch.
Here's the `-Ytyper-debug` trace for `failed`:

This might well be the same bug as SI-5294
A variation I tried (that also failed)

{code}

object Test {
  trait SubtypeOf[+T] {
    type Type <: T
  }

  class Owned[+P <: Owner with Singleton](val next: Option[P#R])

  class Owner {
    type This <: Owner with Singleton
    val R = SubtypeOf[Owned[This]]
    type R = R.Type

    def next(o: Owned[this.type]): Owned[This] = o.next.get
  }

  object Owner extends Owner {
    type This = this.type
  }

  def SubtypeOf[T]: SubtypeOf[T] = new SubtypeOf[T] { type Type = T }

  def compiles(o: Owned[Owner.type]): Owned[Owner.type] = o.next.get

  def fails(o: Owned[Owner.type]): Owned[Owner.type] = o.next.get.next.get

  def fix(o: Owned[Owner.type]): Owned[Owner.type] = (o.next.get: Owned[Owner.type]).next.get
}

{code}
Indeed, both variants compile with my as-yet unmerged patch for SI-5294. I'm going to merge these tickets, and then see about merging that patch (IIRC it revealed a latent bug elsewhere in the compiler which also needs to be fixed... sigh)

You are correct, though the bug wasn't exactly latent. It is the bug underlying SI-6161. More to come elsewhere.
