=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
++ returns a SortedMap, not a TreeMap (but ++: works)
```scala
TreeMap(1->2) ++ TreeMap(2->3)
res0: scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap[Int,Int] = Map(1 -> 2, 2 -> 3)
```

update returns a plain Map, not a TreeMap (but updated works)
```scala
TreeMap(1->2)(1) = 3
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,Int] = Map(1 -> 3)
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Methods should have the proper return type as intended in Scala 2.8.


=== What do you see instead? ===
Methods return an arbitrary supertype.


=== Additional information ===
Related bug: #4027 (TreeMap.mapValues should return a TreeMap instead of a Map.)


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
Alex, since you handle #4027 can you please have a look at this one too? Reassign to the meeting otherwise.
(In r23947) Fixes #4112. Closes #4112.

No review.
Hi Prokopec,

it seems you fixed ++, but missed update.

As far as I understand, either overriding update from MapLike with
```scala
override def updated [B1 >: B](key: A, value: B1): TreeMap[A, B1] = updated(key, value)
```
or copying it from updated like this
```scala
override def update [B1 >: B](key: A, value: B1): TreeMap[A, B1] = {
  val newsize = if (tree.lookup(key).isEmpty) size + 1 else size
  TreeMap.make(newsize, tree.update(key, value))
} 
```
should work.

"update" is deprecated, but I guess that small fix won't hurt until the method is removed completely, considering that it might still be heavily used until that happens.

If you closed it because there is some rule not to fix deprecated methods, than accept my apology for reopening it.
