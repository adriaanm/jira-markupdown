I like that plan. Can you comment on what workloads / benchmarks might be negatively affected by just using {{execute}}?
```
The JDK7 version has terrible scalability.
```

Can you point to particular versions/commits that are critical? I'd like to be sure that they exist in our fork.

Would we have the same problem with all JDK7 builds, or just the earlier ones?

Sorry if these questions are a bit basic, but I'm not a jsr166 expert, so I need precision in the advice here.
