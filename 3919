I tested Actors on my device running `Android 1.5` and on an emulator running `Android 1.6`. 
The dalvik VM on these OS versions isn't capable of ignoring missing methods when loading a class. You will always be greeted with a crash just by loading the `scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinTask` class.

On android 2.1 dalvik is a little bit more resilient:

As the current actors implementation depends on the forkjoin library (calling Actor.start() will load the `ForkJoinTask` class) it doesn't work at all on `Android` 1.5 and 1.6 devices.

I will not change the status of this ticket as I think you guys should decide whether targeting 1.5 and 1.6 devices is worth the effort.
