SLS 6.19 has:
{noformat}
Enumerator ::= ... 'val' Pattern1 '=' Expr
{noformat}

'val' here should be optional, or even omitted. It has not been required by the compiler in many years, and standard style (e.g. in Programming in Scala) is to omit it. My understanding is that it might even be disallowed in the future.

Simon: This is a ticket on the language spec, not on the code.  I just checked http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/pdfs/ScalaReference.pdf and it isn't fixed yet.
