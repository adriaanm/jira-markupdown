Pull request #1425 removes the `MigrationSystem` and adds an `ActorDSL` object which also exists in Akka. The pull request also fixes all the "actmig" test cases to use `ActorDSL`.

The actor migration guide updates are _not_ part of this issue. They should happen independently from this bug fix, as explained by Josh Suereth. As a result the pending migration guide update will not block the staging of the Scala 2.10.0 distribution. Instead, they will be handled in the same way as other pending updates to docs.scala-lang.org.
