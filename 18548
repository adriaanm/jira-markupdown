In order to match Scala jars with their sources in Eclipse, a few additional lines need to be added in the MANIFEST.MF file inside source jars:

{code}
Bundle-SymbolicName: org.scala-lang.scala-compiler.source
Bundle-Version: ${osgi.version}
Eclipse-SourceBundle: org.scala-lang.scala-compiler;version="${osgi.version}";roots:="."
{code}
