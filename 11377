An approximation, perhaps.

The feature intends to save the user from drilling down into closure implementations.  For -Ydelambdafy:inline, it examines the anonfun classes for C.  For method, it looks at lamba classes and follows the invokestatic of accessors to select the anonfun methods of C.

So -fun C selects all closures in C, -fun C#f closures in method f.
