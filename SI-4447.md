```scala
scala> def g[A, B >: A] {}
g: [A,B >: A]=> Unit

scala> def f[A, B, C >: A <: B] = g[A, B]
<console>:8: error: type arguments [A,B] do not conform to method g's type parameter bounds [A,B >: A]
       def f[A, B, C >: A <: B] = g[A, B]
                                   ^
```
Since <: is transitive, C >: A <: B immediately implies that A <: B, but right now the compiler doesn't "see" it.

Sorry, I don't quite understand your example:
```scala
scala> def f[C >: Any <: Nothing] {}
<console>:8: error: type arguments [Any] do not conform to method f's type parameter bounds [C >: Any <: Nothing]
  `f`
                       ^
```
Isn't it ok for the code to use false assumptions when it can never be reached because type parameters can not be instantiated?
