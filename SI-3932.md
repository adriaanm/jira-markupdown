This is the cause of SI-1537 but it seems like a big deal so here it is on its own.
{code}
class Foo() {
  println("Created Foo")
}
// C can be an abstract class or a trait - same behavior
abstract class C {
  // f can be a val or a def - same behavior
  val f: Foo
  def g1 = List(f, f, f).mkString("In C: ", ", ", "")
}
object O1 extends C {
  val f = new Foo()
  def g2 = List(f, f, f).mkString("In O1: ", ", ", "")
}
object O2 extends C {
  object f extends Foo
  def g2 = List(f, f, f).mkString("In O2: ", ", ", "")
}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("O1 using val:")
    println(O1.g1)
    println(O1.g2)
    
    println("\nO2 using object:")
    println(O2.g1)
    println(O2.g2)
  }
}
{code}
Running this we see:
{code}
O1 using val:
Created Foo
In C: Foo@13f6ba0f, Foo@13f6ba0f, Foo@13f6ba0f
In O1: Foo@13f6ba0f, Foo@13f6ba0f, Foo@13f6ba0f

O2 using object:
Created Foo
Created Foo
Created Foo
Created Foo
In C: O2$$f$$@60f47bf5, O2$$f$$@52f6438d, O2$$f$$@25cd0888
In O2: O2$$f$$@25cd0888, O2$$f$$@25cd0888, O2$$f$$@25cd0888
{code}
If f is implemented with an object, then each time f is referenced in C it is recreated.  Since the compiler treats f like a stable identifier it goes without saying this is unsound, and it also means that code which people may be depending on being executed once is being executed arbitrarily many times.  Which makes it a little amazing it has lasted this long.

The behavior does not arise if C has O2 as its self-type.

Confirmed in 2.7.7, 2.8.0, and trunk.
