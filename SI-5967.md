This doesn't compile:

{code}
def f(a: Int*) = a match {
  case 0 :: Nil => "List(0)! My favorite Seq!"
  case _ => a.toString
}
{code}
{noformat}
error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : collection.immutable.::[B]
 required: Int*
{noformat}

But this does:

{code}
def f(a: Int*) = (a: Seq[Int]) match {
  case 0 :: Nil => "List(0)! My favorite Seq!"
  case _ => a.toString
}
{code}

I think it's obvious, but per the spec, the identifier {{a}} should already have the type Seq[Int] inside the body of {{f}} in either case, yet in the first case, the compiler seems to think that {{a}} has a type which is a strict subtype of Seq[Int] and which List does not extend.

Seems related to (if not a dupe of) SI-4176.
Sorry if this is a dumb thought, but would it be less dirty to fix this in typedIdent rather than typedMatch? I'm thinking something like changing that final call to stabilize ([line 4751|https://github.com/retronym/scala/blob/ee8003f825ea842e72ada61a820d865078ac196b/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Typers.scala#L4751] in your commit) from
{code}
stabilize(tree2, pre2, mode, pt)
{code}
to
{code}
val tree3 = stabilize(tree2, pre2, mode, pt)
tree3 setType dropRepeatedParamType(tree3.tpe)
{code}

Unless this is bad for some reason, it seems like it represents the general idea of "identifiers referring to repeated parameter symbols should have Seq type rather than <repeated> type" better than fixing it ad-hoc for pattern matching. (And maybe&mdash;I haven't tried this, just a shot in the dark&mdash;it would mean you don't need dropRepeatedParamType inside widenIfNecessary anymore to ensure that {{val a2 = a}} doesn't get {{a}}'s <repeated>ness.)
