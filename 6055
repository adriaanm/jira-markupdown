This was done at r23666, to fix #4001. Here's the log:

    immutable.Map keySet returns immutable.Set.  Closes #4001, no review.

And that's that. Scala.collection.keySet returns a protected KeySet class that does the trick, while scala.collection.immutable.keySet creates a new collection.

Commit by extempore.
