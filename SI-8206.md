At the moment Assign is context sensitive due to the fact that it can't be distinguished from named argument:
```scala
def f(x: Any) = x 
var x = ...
f(x = 2) 
```
In order to minimize ambiguity we can force people who really want to have assign in that position should add extra parens or curly braces to disambiguate:
```scala
f(x = 2) // named arg
f((x = 2)) // assign
f { x = 2 } // assign
```
This would allow us to replace AssignOrNamedArg tree with just NamedArg.  
Here's a contrived example when the intuitive interpretation is definitely assignment:

```scala
scala> object O { var x = 0 ; def foo = synchronized { x = 1 } }
defined object O

scala> O.foo; O.x
res0: Int = 1
```
Man, I ran into a case today where I really wanted to write
```scala
doUpdate(_.copy(someField = _, anotherField = _))
```
but instead I had to write
```scala
doUpdate((a, b, c) => a.copy(someField = b, anotherField = c))
```

Not a bug, as spec'd, etc.; but am I correct in guessing that this proposed change would mean that the parser would recognize `someField = _` as a named arg and not an expression, so that the former would be a valid anonymous function? Because that would be pretty nifty.
related to #8342, we plan to dis-ambiguate `foo(a = x)`
