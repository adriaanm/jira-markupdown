At the moment Assign is context sensitive due to the fact that it can't be distinguished from named argument:
{code}
def f(x: Any) = x 
var x = ...
f(x = 2) 
{code}
In order to minimize ambiguity we can force people who really want to have assign in that position should add extra parens or curly braces to disambiguate:
{code}
f(x = 2) // named arg
f((x = 2)) // assign
f { x = 2 } // assign
{code}
This would allow us to replace AssignOrNamedArg tree with just NamedArg.  
Here's a contrived example when the intuitive interpretation is definitely assignment:

{code}
scala> object O { var x = 0 ; def foo = synchronized { x = 1 } }
defined object O

scala> O.foo; O.x
res0: Int = 1
{code}

Man, I ran into a case today where I really wanted to write
{code:scala}
doUpdate(_.copy(someField = _, anotherField = _))
{code}
but instead I had to write
{code:scala}
doUpdate((a, b, c) => a.copy(someField = b, anotherField = c))
{code}
#firstworldprogrammingproblems

Not a bug, as spec'd, etc.; but am I correct in guessing that this proposed change would mean that the parser would recognize {{someField = _}} as a named arg and not an expression, so that the former would be a valid anonymous function? Because that would be pretty nifty.
related to SI-8342, we plan to dis-ambiguate {{foo(a = x)}}
