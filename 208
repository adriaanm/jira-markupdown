Please provide a more precise description of the issue:

* What code did you compile?
  For this, you should provide a _minimal_ piece of code required to reproduce the bug.

* What was the observed behavior?
  Here, compiler output and/or (parts of) stack traces are useful.

* What is the expected behavior? Why?

Thanks!
