=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
scala.xml.parsing.XhtmlParser(scala.io.Source.fromString("<p/><b/>"))
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Expected it to throw an exception saying "document must contain exactly one element"

=== What do you see instead? ===

Repl output:

:1:8: document must contain exactly one element       ^
List(<p></p>, <b></b>)
res1: scala.xml.NodeSeq = Document(<b></b>)

(Its printing an error to the console???)


=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:
  - Java:
  - Operating system: 
Speaking only of [Xhtml](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#strict), we have the following rules:

- It must be an XML Document
- It must conform to one of certain pre-defined DTDs.
- The root element of the document must be `html`.
- The root element of the document must contain an `xmlns` declaration.
- There must be a `DOCTYPE` declaration in the document prior to the root element.
- The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD

From the pre-requisite of it needing to be an XML Document, we have [this](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-well-formed) requirement, indicating that it must follow the production rule `prolog element Misc*`, where `prolog` and `Misc` contain only the xml declaration, comments, processing instructions, spaces and newlines.

So, taken all together, `XhtmlParser` should complain about the following:

- There's more than one root.
- It does not conform to any of the valid DTDs.
- The root is not called `html`.
- The root does not contain a `xmlns` declaration.
- There's no `DOCTYPE` declaration prior to the root.

I expect such strictness to be detrimental instead of a feature for most applications. However, *failing* and still returning something -- that does not represent the input given -- is definitely very bad.

For whatever it is worth, this reminds me a lot of #4520. Though the symptom is rather different, I suspect they both arise from the lack of an exception.
