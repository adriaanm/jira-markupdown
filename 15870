=== How to reproduce ===
{code}
scala> import scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList
import scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList

scala> val ll = LinkedList(1, 2, 3)
ll: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2, 3)

scala> ll.insert(LinkedList(0))

scala> ll
res4: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2, 3, 0)
{code} 

=== Expected behavior ===

From insert's scaladoc:

> Insert linked list {{that}} at current position of this linked list


=== What do you see instead? ===

The "inserted" LinkedList is being appended.

=== Additional information ===

This was broken on r22830, where {{that.append(next)}} became {{next.append(that)}}, at the same time that two lines of code were joined into one.

So it is present on Scala 2.8.1, but not on Scala 2.8.0 (on which version LinkedList had a host of other problems).

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: not relevant
  - Operating system: not relevant
