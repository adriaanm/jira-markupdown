Most of the programs I've compiled from source have had a "make install" option that puts them into /usr/bin or something.  Do I just copy the dists/latest/bin stuff into /usr/bin?  Then again, some of the websites say I should be adding existing things to my paths.  Do I have to do something about manpages?  And how do I make sure that sbaz knows where I've put things?

There are steps between "ant dist" and "scalac ~/test.scala" or "emacs ~/test.scala".  Many of these steps (manpages, putting executables somewhere) are only a problem because of my basic lack of unix knowledge; putting them into the readme is more courtesy than necessity.  But some of the steps (sbaz, scala-tools, etc.) are scala-specific, and definitely need to be in the documentation.
