Iulian, I agree that WeakHashMap[A, Unit] or WeakHashMap[A, Null] would be an improvement but we would waste a lot more memory than necessary in that case due to all WeakHashMap.Entry objects having unused field for value. If we want to use WeakHashSet in a very hot places we need to optimize more. See SI-7149 for details.
