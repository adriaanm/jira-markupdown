Below I show two lines of code which should be equivalent but aren't - implicit resolution has issues on the first. The workaround was simply to desugar the context bound `That: Man` into an implicit parameter - hence I would say that this is a bug. `-Xprint:typer` suggest that this bug will stay open for long, as explained below.

Non-working version:
```scala
def map[B:Man, That:Man](f: Exp[A] => Exp[B])(implicit foo: CanBuild1[B, That]): Exp[That]
```
Working version:
```scala
def map[B:Man, That](f: Exp[A] => Exp[B])(implicit foo: CanBuild1[B, That], m: Man[That]): Exp[That]
```
Note that the two lines desugar into different things: the order of implicit parameters is different.
The first desugars to:
```scala
def map[B >: Nothing <: Any, That >: Nothing <: Any](f: BugMan.Exp[A] => BugMan.Exp[B])(implicit evidence$6: BugMan.Man[B], evidence$7: BugMan.Man[That], foo: BugMan.CanBuild1[B,That]): BugMan.Exp[That] = scala.sys.`package`.error("TraversableOps1.map")
//Call site:
new BugMan.TraversableOps1[Int]()(BugMan.this.man[Int]).map[Int, List[Int]](((x: BugMan.Exp[Int]) => x))(BugMan.this.man[Int], BugMan.this.man[Nothing], BugMan.this.canBuildList1[Int](BugMan.this.man[Int]));
```
Note that `That` is deduced from the **last** parameter and used before.
The second example desugars to:
```scala
def map[B >: Nothing <: Any, That >: Nothing <: Any](f: BugMan.Exp[A] => BugMan.Exp[B])(implicit evidence$9: BugMan.Man[B], foo: BugMan.CanBuild1[B,That], m: BugMan.Man[That]): BugMan.Exp[That] = scala.sys.`package`.error("TraversableOps1.map")
//Call site:
new BugMan.TraversableOps2[Int]()(BugMan.this.man[Int]).map[Int, List[Int]](((x: BugMan.Exp[Int]) => x))(BugMan.this.man[Int], BugMan.this.canBuildList1[Int](BugMan.this.man[Int]), BugMan.this.man[List[Int]])
```

Complete example and error message below.

The error message mentions `Nothing`, as if type inference hadn't fully happened. In fact, this code would require the different implicits to be in different parameter lists - or failing that, scalac should do type inference across a single parameter list, the kind of thing which it consciously refuses to do for e.g. non-curried fold methods. Given that the second thing is not going to happen soon, I'd mention again my proposal for multiple implicit parameter lists:

http://blaisorbladeprog.blogspot.de/2013/01/flexible-implicits-from-agda-for-scala.html

Note that if instead of a generic `Man` I use `Manifest` (as I was doing before reducing the example), the error message is completely different - it claims another implicit is missing, of type `CanBuild1\[Int,That]` - as if `That` hadn't yet been deduced.

```scala
object BugMan {
  class Man[T]
  implicit def man[T] = new Man[T]

  class Exp[A:Man]
  class CanBuild1[B:Man, That:Man]
  implicit def canBuildList1[A:Man] = new CanBuild1[A, List[A]]
  //Fails:
//  /*
  class TraversableOps1[A:Man] {
    def map[B:Man, That:Man](f: Exp[A] => Exp[B])(implicit foo: CanBuild1[B, That]): Exp[That] = sys error "TraversableOps1.map"
  }
  for { x <- new TraversableOps1[Int] } yield x
//  */
  class TraversableOps2[A:Man] {
    def map[B:Man, That](f: Exp[A] => Exp[B])(implicit foo: CanBuild1[B, That], m: Man[That]): Exp[That] = sys error "TraversableOps1.map"
  }
  for { x <- new TraversableOps2[Int] } yield x
}

object BugManifest {
  class Exp[A:Manifest]
  class CanBuild1[B:Manifest, That:Manifest]
  implicit def canBuildList1[A:Manifest] = new CanBuild1[A, List[A]]
  //Fails:
//  /*
  class TraversableOps1[A:Manifest] {
    def map[B:Manifest, That:Manifest](f: Exp[A] => Exp[B])(implicit foo: CanBuild1[B, That]): Exp[That] = sys error "TraversableOps1.map"
  }
  for { x <- new TraversableOps1[Int] } yield x
//  */
  class TraversableOps2[A:Manifest] {
    def map[B:Manifest, That](f: Exp[A] => Exp[B])(implicit foo: CanBuild1[B, That], m: Manifest[That]): Exp[That] = sys error "TraversableOps1.map"
  }
  for { x <- new TraversableOps2[Int] } yield x
}
```

Scalac's lament:
```scala
bugReport.scala:14: error: type mismatch;
 found   : BugMan.Man[Nothing]
 required: BugMan.Man[List[Int]]
Note: Nothing <: List[Int], but class Man is invariant in type T.
You may wish to define T as +T instead. (SLS 4.5)
  for { x <- new TraversableOps1[Int] } yield x
          ^
bugReport.scala:31: error: could not find implicit value for parameter foo: BugManifest.CanBuild1[Int,That]
  for { x <- new TraversableOps1[Int] } yield x
          ^
two errors found
```
IIUC, with the change you propose, Scalac would desugar context bounds into implicits at the **end** of the list.

This change **might** cause regressions when the opposite order is better, so it's not obvious it is an improvement. But I know no concrete instance, so there might be some non-obvious reason this regression is impossible.

In fact, context bounds are always desugared to implicit params with a single type parameter (`TypeConstructor[T]`, rather than `TypeConstructor[T, U]`), so I can't exclude that they are easier to infer and they can be moved at the end. But I see no good argument there.

Failing that, I don't see how this can be easily improved.
bq. so I can't exclude that they are easier to infer and they can be moved at the end.

The problem - as I see it - is not the inference of itself the implicit, but the inference of the type parameter of a context bound. As far as I have understood, the context bound places a **restriction** on the type parameter - whereas implicit parameters might help in actually **inferring** a type parameter. Suppose the following:

```scala
class A[X,Y]
class B; class C
implicit val a = new A[B,C]
def f[U,V : Manifest](u : U)(implicit ax : A[U,V]) = ...
```

The intention of the programmer would be:

*get me a `V` for which an implicit `A\[U,V]` exists. Do not let `V` be such that `Manifest\[V]` does not have an implicit associated*

However, the signature of **f** tells the type inference engine that:
*there are two type parameters, `U` and `V`. `U` is the type of `u`. Please fetch some kind of `V` for which an implicit `Manifest` exists. Now, please fetch me an `A\[U,V]`.*

The algorithm here chooses Nothing as the smallest type for which a Manifest exists; but `A\[U,Nothing]` does not exist for any `U` as an implicit. Thus, `f(new B)` will fail with "implicit not found" in spite of `V =:= C` being a perfectly sensible choice.

One would need to write:
```scala
def f[U,V](u : U)(implicit ax : A[U,V], m  : Manifest[V]) = ...
```

to let both implicits be correctly guessed.

I would argue that something called a "bound" should not make the type inference engine make any guess about the type and then keep to it. Imagine if an upper type bound would make type inference assume that if the type parameter is not explicitly specified, then it **must** be itself the upper bound.
I absolutely agree with this; currently we are discussing half-solutions to a sub-question of a quite hard problem. 

bq. the problem is that making it more predictable 
What do you mean by inference not being predictable? 

bq. (AFAIK) a hard research problem
Do you have any specific ongoing research in mind?

bq. Moreover, it would probably change behavior in some cases, so it would be hard to push this in for Scala 2.

What comes to my mind are cases where implicits are explicitly passed; the order of parameters matters here a lot and mixing them up might sometimes cause bugs only detected at run time. 

Maybe a less intrusive patch that should not break existing code and not result in the complete rewrite of the inference algorithms could be proposed along the lines of the following:
1. Annotate context bound-generated evidences with @weakEvidence
2. **Iff** the language feature **weakEvidences** is enabled, let the inference algorithm consider the un-annotated parameters first. 
3. If the language feature is turned off and implicit resolution ultimately fails but turning it on would work, a compiler hint could be given.
@Barnabás Králik, I'm not sure I can add something on your proposal. (I hadn't seen Jason Zaugg's latest answer).
> What do you mean by inference not being predictable?

Take an arbitrary Scala program requiring type/implicit inference to fill in some blanks. Can you **predict** whether Scalac will manage to do such inference? I know nobody who can. There are many other questions whose answer should be predictable and isn't.

For instance, Dunﬁeld and Krishnaswami write, in a type inference paper for a different language (without subtyping):
"We want to relieve programmers from having to write redundant type annotations, and even more importantly, enable programmers to easily **predict** where type annotations are needed." (Sec. 2.3, Robustness of Typing; the paper lives at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.6032.pdf, http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500582). Some theorems in that section state that some simple refactorings keep type inference working. (However, those theorems are hard to prove).

For instance, imagine the statement "if you change the order of implicit parameters in a function declaration, it will still be possible to infer implicit parameters for every call site where it was possible before". If this were a theorem for Scala type inference, this bug would not show up. That's why I titled the bug "Order of implicit arguments matters".

However, that paper contains a 70-page appendix of proofs, and the Scala type system is bigger and more complex, so it's not easy to extend their work to Scala — it would be another research effort. So, I don't have "specific ongoing research in mind", but maybe this research is happening as part of the Dotty project. But I would expect quite some improvements to be possible.
