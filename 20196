In http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/01-lexical-syntax.html, the text says:

bq. ... printable ASCII characters \u0020 - \u007F ...

However, DELETE (U+007F) is a control character, not a printable character.

The text should say something like:

bq. ... printable ASCII characters \u0020 - \u007E ...
