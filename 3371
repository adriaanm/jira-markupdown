There was some sketchy repl code out there for a short period, but it should be all healthy with any slightly more recent trunk build.
```scala
scala> case class Point(x: Int, y: Int)
defined class Point

scala> val p = Point(3,4)
p: Point = Point(3,4)

scala> p.copy(x = 3)
res0: Point = Point(3,4)
```
