=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def repeat(count: Int = 1, x: Boolean = true)(thunk: => Double) : Unit = (0 until count).foreach(_ => thunk)
repeat: (count: Int, x: Boolean)(thunk: => Double)Unit

scala> def repeat(thunk: => Double) : Unit = repeat()(thunk)
<console>:8: error: not enough arguments for method repeat: (thunk: => Double)Unit.
Unspecified value parameter thunk.
       def repeat(thunk: => Double) : Unit = repeat()(thunk)
                                                   ^
{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Note that in the real implementation, I would use parameterized return type, but hard-binding to Double to reduce complexity.

I expected no error.

Interestingly, if I compile similar code with scalac, it compiles fine.

{code}
object Control {
  def repeat(count: Int = 1, x: Boolean = true)(thunk: => Double) : Unit = (0 until count).foreach(_ => thunk)
  def repeat(thunk: => Double) : Unit = repeat()(thunk)
}
{code}

{code}
scalac repeat.scala
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===

I see error in REPL and no error through compiler.
