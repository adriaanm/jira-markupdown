What you write corresponds to what is stated in the Scala specification (section "Placeholder Syntax for Existential Types").

The syntax {{A[_]}} is equivalent to {{A[T] forsome { type T >: scala.Nothing <: scala.Any }}}. When you explicitly specify {{ val a:A[_] }} you are telling the compiler to assume that that one is the type of {{a}}.

You can just write ` val a = new B ` instead, and type inference will give you the specific type you are looking for.
