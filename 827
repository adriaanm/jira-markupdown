Anli, the problem you mention is in fact a symptom of the latest version of issue SI-451 (which breaks in new and improved ways following the recent changes in the compilation of Arrays). If you remove the call to `getLen(Array(1,2,3))` from David's example, you will find that `NoSuchMethodException: [I.length()` does not occur, even before the fix in r19444.

As for the thread-safety issue, I still think is fixed. If there is someone who did reliably encounter it on some given hardware, I'd be thankful for him to test it and confirm that the bug is fixed. Otherwise, an expert in concurrent Java (I am not) should have a detailed look at the generated bytecode.
