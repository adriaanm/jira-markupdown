```scala
scala> scala.Double.MinValue == -java.lang.Double.MAX_VALUE
res0: Boolean = true

scala> scala.Double.Epsilon == java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE 
res1: Boolean = true
```

where did you find the description "The smallest difference between two values of Double." However, if you look up its value it's set to java.lang.Double.MIN_VALUE"?
