object Bug extends App {
  class Result(_str: => String) {
    lazy val str = _str
  }
  
  def foo(str: => String)(i: Int) = new Result(str)
  
  def bar(f: Int => Result) = f(42)
  
  var test: String = null
  val result = bar(foo(test))
  test = "bar"
  
  if (result.str == null) {
    println("Destroy ALL THE THINGS!!!")
  } else {
    println("Stroke a kitten")
  }
}
{noformat}

We would expect the output of this code would be "Stroke a kitten", since the value of `test` is given a non-null value *before* the `str` lazy val is realized.  However, the actual printout is "Destroy ALL THE THINGS!!!", which isn't a polite thing to do.

The problem lies in the bytecode generated for `bar(foo(test))`.  More specifically, the issue is in the lifting of the `test` actual for the `foo` invocation.  Bytecode (from Bug$delayedInit$body.apply:()Ljava/lang/Object;):

{noformat}
      18: aload_0       
      19: getfield      #12                 // Field $outer:LBug$;
      22: invokevirtual #22                 // Method Bug$.test:()Ljava/lang/String;
      25: astore_1      
      26: new           #24                 // class Bug$$anonfun$1
      29: dup           
      30: aload_1       
      31: invokespecial #27                 // Method Bug$$anonfun$1."<init>":(Ljava/lang/String;)V
{noformat}

Notice instruction 22.  We're getting a raw (un-thunked) value for `test` and *then* lifting it into the requisite closure for the foo(test) invocation.

Using an explicit thunk (of type () => String) rather than a by-name parameter for `str` avoids this issue.
Frankly, I think the sooner we put DelayedInit to rest the better. I was responsible for its introduction, mostly to fix Application, but now I think we have exchanged pest for cholera. App should be a very simple macro that simply lifts its body into a method.

This one's not related to {{DelayedInit}}.

{code}
object Bug {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    var test: String = null
    val result = bar(foo(test))
    test = "bar"
  
    if (result.str == null) {
      println("Destroy ALL THE THINGS!!!")
    } else {
      println("Stroke a kitten")
    }
  }

  class Result(_str: => String) {
    lazy val str = _str
  }
  
  def foo(str: => String)(i: Int) = new Result(str)
  
  def bar(f: Int => Result) = f(42)   
}
{code}

This is actually an eta-expansion problem, very nifty:

{code}
object Bug {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    var test: String = null
    val fun1: Int => () => Unit = foo(test) _
    val fun2: Int => () => Unit = foo(test)(_)
    test = "some string"
    fun1(1)()
    fun2(1)()
  }
  
  def foo(s: => String)(dummy: Int) = () => println(s)
}
{code}

This prints

{code}
null
some string
{code}

because the two functions {{f1}} and {{f2}} are constructed differently ({{-Xprint:typer}})

{code}
val fun1: Int => (() => Unit) = {
  <synthetic> val eta$0$1: String = test;
  ((dummy: Int) => Bug.this.foo(eta$0$1)(dummy))
};
val fun2: Int => (() => Unit) = ((x$1: Int) => Bug.this.foo(test)(x$1));
{code}

I guess the synthetic value should be lazy.

Very similar to SI-1980.
Fix pending in [https://github.com/lrytz/scala/tree/t5610].

However, this issue is blocked by SI-5796. Another option is to use a {{Function0}} instead of a lazy val, i.e.

{code}
val fun1: Int => (() => Unit) = {
  <synthetic> val eta$0$1: () => String = () => test;      // Create Function0 value
  ((dummy: Int) => Bug.this.foo(eta$0$1())(dummy))         // Apply the function here
};
val fun2: Int => (() => Unit) = ((x$1: Int) => Bug.this.foo(test)(x$1));
{code}

This is what is currently done for named arguments, i.e. given {{def f(a: Int, b: => Int)}}, a call {{f(b = expr, a = 1)}} is transformed to

{code}
{
  val x$1: () => Int = () => expr
  val x$2: Int = 1
  f(x$2, x$1)
}
{code}
Arguably a {{Function0}} is simpler in this case, and thanks to SI-1247 there is no performance penalty.
Johannes Rudolph proposed spec wording on the application side in comment to SI-302

Funny, I missed this one completely. I had a similar patch in work for SI-308 but since the block was on how to change the spec I first wanted to make my homework to propose a reasonable addition for the 'Eta-Expansion' section of the spec. Good to see it fixed.
shouldn't this ticket and SI-302 both be closed now? the new behavior is already in M4.

(is it because the spec change is still pending?)
