$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18634-b20090902145809 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
{code}
If source file A.scala has not object or trait or class with name A, ant/scalac task doesn't respect previous successful compiling and, as a result, recompile the source at any case.

I'll attach small ant project to illustrate.

P.S. Not sure which ticket component to use.
