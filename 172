Looking at the source code (in List.scala) I think this is the problem:
```scala
final case class ::[B](private var hd: B, private[scala] var tl: List[B]) extends List[B] {
  def head : B = hd
  def tail : List[B] = tl
```

I suspect the problem would go away if we had this instead:
```scala
final case class ::[B](head: B, tail: List[B]) extends List[B] {
```
