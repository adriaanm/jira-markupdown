Looking at the source code (in List.scala) I think this is the problem:

{code}
final case class ::[B](private var hd: B, private[scala] var tl: List[B]) extends List[B] {
  def head : B = hd
  def tail : List[B] = tl
{code}

I suspect the problem would go away if we had this instead:

{code}
final case class ::[B](head: B, tail: List[B]) extends List[B] {
{code}
