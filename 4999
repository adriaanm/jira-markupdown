I can reproduce it using a small example.
{code}
trait Base {
  private val secure_# = 10l
}

class TestUser extends Base {
  def clsMeth(x: Int) = x
  private def foo(x: Int) = x
}

object TestUser extends TestUser {
  def objMeth = "a"

  private def foo(x: Int) = x
}
{code}

Most probably it's due to r23250, but I am not yet 100% sure. I'll look into it.
