If anyone could do this:
```scala
  def f(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = { xs.tail = List(-1, -2, -3) ; xs }
```
would that be a problem? I suggest the answer is "yes, obviously." So what is the difference, other than that list is more widely used?

Think of f above as a library function (possibly the standard library) and the user of that library function as someone with a passing concern in security and data integrity.  (Only a passing concern, not a serious concern, which is in any case de facto excluded for reasons beyond this one.)
