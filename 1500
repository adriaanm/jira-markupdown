I'm also unsing javac 1.6.0_07 and scalac 2.7.2.final. My OS is Linux with kernel 2.6.18-6-686 scala/bug#1 SMP.

The problem went away once I set the Java stack size to 1024k. My guess is that the default stack size on Linux is too small. Unfortunately, I could not figure out what the default stack size is.
