Greg, can I close this bug? It looks like the titles are present (and have been for some time now) -- [scaladoc nightly|http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/index.html#package] 
Or did you have something else in mind?

Edit: now that I carefully read the description I see what the problem is - the pages that appear in the frame, whose title is not displayed. I will fix the page titles.
