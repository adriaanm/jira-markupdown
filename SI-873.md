For simple string:

```scala
scala> val d = """{"function":"add_symbol"}"""
d: java.lang.String = {"function":"add_symbol"}

scala> JSON.parseFull(d)
res17: Option[Any] = Some(List((function,add_symbol)))
```

Above behavior doesn't sound correct. It used to return a Map in 2.6.1, which was more correct imho.
