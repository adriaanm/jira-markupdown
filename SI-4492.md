=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
Consider these three simple Scala source files:

File projectA/org/example/a/A.scala:
```scala
package org.example.a

class A
```


File projectB/org/example/b/B.scala:
```scala
package org.example.b

import org.example.a.A

class B {
  val a = new A()
}
```

File projectC/org/example/c/C.scala:
```scala
package org.example.c

import org.example.b.B

class C {
  val b = new B()
  b.a
}
```


Now, we compile the first two separately without problems:
```scala
$$ scalac -d bin/projectA/ projectA/src/org/example/a/
$$ scalac -d bin/projectB/ -cp bin/projectA/ projectB/src/
```

Compiling the 3rd requires both projectA and projectB on the classpath. Leaving out projectA causes an expected error, but the error message is not as helpful as it could be:
```scala
$$ scalac -d bin/projectC/ -cp bin/projectB/ projectC/src/org/example/c/C.scala
error: class file needed by B is missing.
reference value a of package org.example refers to nonexisting symbol.
one error found
```

If we reimplement class C in Java:
```scala
package org.example.c;

import org.example.b.B;

class C {
  public final B b;
  
  public C() {
    b = new B();
    b.a();
  }
}
```

and then compile using the Java compiler we get:
```scala
$$ javac -d bin/projectC/ -cp bin/projectB/:scala-library.jar projectC/src/org/example/c/C.java
projectC/src/org/example/c/C.java:10: cannot access org.example.a.A
class file for org.example.a.A not found
    b.a();
       ^
1 error
```

This error tells us exactly what is wrong.

The source and a build script is attached.

=== Additional information ===
Doing the same in Eclipse leads to an even better error message (actually two messages):
 * The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the class file for org.example.a.A. Fix the build path then try building this project
 * The type org.example.a.A cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files

This issue was originally (incorrectly) raised as part of another ticket on the Scala IDE bug tracking system:
 * http://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000370
