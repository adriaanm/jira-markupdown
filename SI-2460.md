I've been using Regex in Scala 2.7 as part of a project and have a couple of suggestions to improve it.

1.  Introduce a new method, findAllMatchIn, that returns a MatchDataIterator.  The other find methods of Regex generally have a findXxx and findXxxMatch variants, but in the case of findAllIn, there is only one that returns MatchIterator.  To get an iterator over MatchData objects, one must call matchData on the iterator.  Making this change would make the findAllIn API consistent with the other find interfaces.  Deprecate the matchData method of MatchIterator.

2.  In RichString, introduce an r(groupNames: String*) method to complement the existing .r method, which does not accept group names.

Looks like this was never incorporated.

It would be nice to at least get the group-name-aware version of "r".

Just replace

  def r: Regex = new Regex(toString)

with

  def r(groupNames: String*): Regex = new Regex(toString, groupNames: _*)



I don't like the deprecation of {{matchData}}. I'm creating a pull request for this, but I'm leaving this particular bit out.
I created [pull request 136|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/136] with the patch, minus the deprecation of `matchData`.
