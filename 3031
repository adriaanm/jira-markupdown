You are right, I didn't mean to imply that there in a common underlining cause for the two bugs. My reasoning is that since they both happen after a clean and since (if I am correct) the task items are added by the presentation compiler there might be various inconsistencies that happen in the state of the presentation compiler after a clean operation.

Related in my previous comment meant that the fix for scala/bug#2710 and the fix this bug might be in the same area so scala/bug#2710 might be a good bug to tackle after this one.
