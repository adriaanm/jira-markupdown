{{ExecutionContext}} needs to provide a hook similar to this:
{code:none}
def prepare[T, U](f: Try[T] => U): ExecutionContext
{code}
The idea is that {{prepare}} is invoked on the thread that is submitting a task for execution. The returned {{ExecutionContext}} is then used to do the actual execution. Such a hook should enable implementing Twitter's {{Local}} abstraction, for example.
