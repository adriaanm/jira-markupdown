This compiles:
```scala
object Test {
  val a = ""
  var b: a.type = a
}
```

This fails, the only difference being the addition of "final" on the val. 
```scala
object Test {
  final val a = ""
  var b: a.type = a
}
```
And the failure is
```
b.scala:3: error: assignment to non variable
  var b: a.type = a
      ^
one error found
```
This seems specific to String:

```scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object Test {
  final val a = new {}
  var b: a.type = a
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.
```

Constant folding?
