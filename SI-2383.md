When overloading a method with a curried version, the compiler is unable to distinguish, even thought a curried version **requires** a trailing underscore.

def foo(b: Bar) {
  // do something
}

def foo(b: Bar) (f: (Bar) => Baz) {
  // do something else
}

Calling:

foo(bar)

causes the compiler to issue an ambiguity error. But had I wanted the curried version, I would (in fact, I'm required to) write:

foo(bar) _

So methods defined in this pattern are never actually invokeable, by design?
That seems odd.

Perhaps the compiler should issue a warning when encountering methods defined in this pattern to warn users that they will not actually be useable.
