The following does not compile:

```scala
trait Foo {
  type A
  type F[_ <: A]
}

object Test {
  def noop[A, F[_ <: A]]: Unit = ()

  def f(foo: Foo): Unit = {
    noop[foo.A, foo.F] // does not compile
  }
}
```

The error is:

```scala
error: kinds of the type arguments (foo.A,foo.F) do not conform to the expected kinds of the type parameters (type A,type F).
foo.F's type parameters do not match type F's expected parameters:
type _ (in trait Foo)'s bounds <: Foo.this.A are stricter than type _'s declared bounds <: A
           noop[foo.A, foo.F] // does not compile
```
Merging with #9337, which I'll try to revive. The patch I linked in the comments of that ticket leads to successful bounds checking of your example above.
