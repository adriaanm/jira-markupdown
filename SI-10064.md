Submitting a lambda as a callable and retrieving the future on the same line causes the REPL to hang.

{code:scala}
Welcome to Scala 2.12.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_112).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> import java.util.concurrent._
import java.util.concurrent._

scala> val exec = Executors.newCachedThreadPool
exec: java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService = java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor@7512870b[Running, pool size = 0, active threads = 0, queued tasks = 0, completed tasks = 0]
{code}

OK, because not a lambda:

{code:scala}
scala> exec.submit(new Callable[String] { def call = "foo" }).get
res0: String = foo
{code}

OK, because retrieval separate from submission:

{code:scala}
scala> val f = exec.submit(() => "foo")
f: java.util.concurrent.Future[String] = java.util.concurrent.FutureTask@2c81f298

scala> f.get
res1: String = foo
{code}

Hangs:

{code:scala}
scala> exec.submit(() => "foo").get
{code}

This was discovered in the real world by attempting {{scalaz.concurrent.Task("foo").run}}, which also hangs.

The same snippets all complete successfully on Scala 2.11.8.
