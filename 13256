Maybe i just don't understand something altho I read the scaladocs, have browsed code, read the preprint actors chapter.

I have a hung actors program when run below code with "x" as argument
```scala
object V {
  import actors.Actor._
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val what = args(0)
    actor {
      react {
        case "" => sender ! None
        case _ =>
          actor {
            react {
              case _ => sender ! None
            }
          } ! ""
          react { case _ => sender ! None }
      }
    } !? what
  }
}
```

But the main should have gotten a None from the outer actor that it waited synchronously on.
Note that if run the code above with "" argument then it completes again with the None getting to the outer actor.
And if you change the outer actor (top level that main waits on) to use receive, then it also completes.

I'm testing with the 2.7.0 scala and JDK 5
 (1.5_10) on Solaris 10.

If you discover what I'm doing wrong here, pls point it out and/or show me the documentation.
