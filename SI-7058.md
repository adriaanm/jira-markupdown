I just found that we have regression in implicit search in 2.10.x branch. It can be reproduced using the following branch:

https://github.com/gkossakowski/specs2/tree/SPECS2-1.13-Scala-2.10.x

The error I get is
```scala
error] /Users/grek/scala/specs2/src/main/scala/org/specs2/reporter/Statistics.scala:55: ambiguous implicit values:
[error]  both object StatsMonoid in object Stats of type org.specs2.specification.Stats.StatsMonoid.type
[error]  and value statsMonoid in class SpecsStatistics of type => org.specs2.specification.Stats.StatsMonoid.type
[error]  match expected type org.specs2.internal.scalaz.Monoid[org.specs2.specification.Stats]
[error]       totalContext(fragments.map(toBlock))
```

This code compiles with 2.10.0.

I'm raising this as a blocker because we need to determine ASAP if this is a real regression or we just fixed bug that allowed code to compile even if it never should.
