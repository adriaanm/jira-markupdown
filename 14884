I found this bug when researching bug scala/bug#2689 and reported it in a comment because I thought that it was the same bug. scala/bug#2689 got fixed but this problem still remains.

*The general case*
 1. we introduce a compilation error in a file
 2. we save the file to compile
 3. edit and save another file to fix the issue (by adding a method for example)

A concrete example that reproduces the bug:
 1. Create and save a file A.scala like the following:
```scala
class A
class B
```
 2. Create and save a file C.scala like the following:
```scala
class C {
  val a: A = new B
}
```

B does not yet extend A so we correctly get the compilation error *type mismatch; found : B required: A*. Now if we change B to extend A and save A.scala the error message will get removed from the Problems View but not from the editor.
