instantiating a mixin object, for instance a "new WeakHashMap with SynchronizedMap" inside a code block whose result is used as a super-constructor parameter causes a java.lang.VerifyError. The same code works fine when removing the "with SynchronizedMap" mixin or when calling the code block as a "static" method on a companion object, but when written directly into the super call it fails.

The attached Test.scala App demonstrates this by implementing three subclasses of the same parent class, one for each described variant, and then instantiating them. The third case in the test is the broken one and causes the error upon execution.

The error is "java.lang.VerifyError: (class: Child, method: <init> signature: ()V) Expecting to find object/array on stack"

minimized

{code}
class Foo 
class Parent(f:Foo)
class Child extends Parent({val x=new Foo{}; x})

new Child
{code}
These variations work fine

{code}
class Foo
class Parent(f:Foo)
class Child extends Parent({new Foo{}})

new Child
{code}

and

{code}
class Foo
class Parent(f:Foo)
class Child extends Parent({val x=new Foo; x})

new Child
{code}
Compare the non-working 

{code}class Child extends Parent({val x=new Foo{}; x}){code}

I think this is a variation of SI-6666, see my test case in the comments:

https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6666?focusedCommentId=61462&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-61462

The sane thing to do is forbid such constructs, but I haven't quite figured out where to put the check.
