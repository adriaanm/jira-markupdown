You're right.  It's inexcusable that we did this, but it's the unfortunate reality of our move to github.  The old sbaz-based distribution build never survived the transition and was somewhat hard to replicate in any case.   We lost the ability to do distribution when moving to github and didn't expect 2.9.2 to happen before 2.10 at the time (Yes, silly, I know).

The reality is we have this one time breakage.  So whatever we do I want it to be the **right** think.  A maintainable build that we can take care of and migrate as time goes on.   I can add a README to the tools-support directory notifying people where to find the code and such for now.   I'm highly reluctant to include in the distro as is. 

However, you can see my efforts to include things back in occuring on this branch:  https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/tree/examples-fix

(Well, you'll see more when I push the new changes.)
