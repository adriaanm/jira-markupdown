Hi, I think this bug should be reopened, Iï¿½observed the same kind of problem with the following example but with static inner classes.

I am using the Scala Eclipse Plugin with tho following version:
org.scala-ide.scala.compiler_2.9.0.r24747-b20110413101932

So I think the previous fix is included.

Test1.scala
```scala
import test2.Test2;

class Test1 extends Test2 {

  new Test2.A()
  
}
```


test2/Test2.java
```scala
package test2;

public class Test2 {

	protected static final class A {
		public A() {
			
		}
	}
}
```

The error is:
class A in object Test2 cannot be accessed in object test2.Test2
Access to protected class A not permitted because enclosing class class Test1 is not a subclass of object Test2 in package test2 where target is defined

Thank you very much.
