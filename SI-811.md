The complete documentation (pdf manuals and scala API docs) should be shipped with each new distribution. Drop sbaz for that. Users need to know that they have everything they need to work without extra downloads and sbaz magic when they download Scala. I downloaded 2.7.1RC1 more than a week ago and I still haven't got the doc using sbaz. I get told to use sbaz and then that sbaz is broken. All of that to get a couple of files? Don't ever assume that the user has always any internet access, even less a fast one. I can be on a site or a plane and discover than the documentation is not there.
