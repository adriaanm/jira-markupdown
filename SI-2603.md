I would like to be able to do:

    val cities = List("London", "New York", "Paris", "Munich")
    val grouped = cities.groupBy(_.length)
    println(grouped) //Map(6 -> List(London, Munich), 8 -> List(New York), 5 -> List(Paris) )

A dumb implementation of this (in scala 2.7) might look like:

    def groupBy[K](itr: Iterable[V])(f : V => K) : Map[K, Iterable[V]] = (Map[K,Iterable[V]]() /: itr) { (m, v) => 
      m + (f(v) -> (v :: m.get(f(v)).getOrElse(Nil)))
    }

I find this incredibly useful functionality and was under the opinion it was in 2.8 but cannot find it
By what means are you trying to find out what already exists? Your hypothetical code works exactly as given and has for a while.
{code}
scala> val cities = List("London", "New York", "Paris", "Munich")
cities: List[java.lang.String] = List(London, New York, Paris, Munich)

scala> val grouped = cities.groupBy(_.length)
grouped: scala.collection.Map[Int,List[java.lang.String]] = Map(6 -> List(London, Munich), 8 -> List(New York), 5 -> List(Paris))
{code}

Apologies Paul - I was looking for the method and looking in the wrong place; it's a bit confusing how the Traversable, TraversableLike, TraversableTemplate etc all fit together (I was looking on Traversable, Iterable, Iterator etc).
