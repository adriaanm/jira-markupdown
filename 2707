Sorry, but the bugtracking system is not the place to be trained in Scala. Please continue this discussion in the scala lounge mailing list. I'm closing it one last time. Here's how you make it less verbose:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r0-b20091111121958 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_15).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val cities = List("London", "Paris")
cities: List[java.lang.String] = List(London, Paris)

scala> import scala.collection.breakOut

scala> (cities.map(x => (x.length, x))(breakOut): Map[Int, String]).foreach { case (len, city) => println (len+ " "+ city)}
6 London
5 Paris
```
