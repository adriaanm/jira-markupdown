Another manifestation of this bug, reported on the mailing list:
```
we noticed some strange behaviour of productIterator in Scala 2.11.5:

case class Data(a: String, b: String, `a-some`: String)
val m = Data("1", "2", "3")
assert(m.productIterator.mkString(", ") == "1, 2, 3")

Result: "1, [3, 2]" did not equal "1, [2, 3]"

"a-some" can be any mangled symbol with an "a" prefix.

Is the order of productIterator on case classes guaranteed to be in parameter order? If so, this seems to be a bug. Can anyone reproduce it?
```
