The synopsis for the advanced compiler option `-Xelide-below` is not correct:
```scala
scalac -X
  ...
  -Xelide-below    Generate calls to @elidable-marked methods only
                   if method priority is greater than argument.
  ...
```

Actually, calls to @elidable-marked methods are generated only if the method priority is greater **or equal** than the argument. 

One could also write that calls to @elidable-marked methods *are omitted* if the method priority is *lower* than the argument (this is how the behavior is specified in the scaladoc of elidable).
