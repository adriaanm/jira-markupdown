Oh good, another bug involving access. Just throw it on the dead letter pile.
```scala
class Foo(x: Int) {
  // a private type should never be displayed
  private type This = Foo
  def + (x: This): This = this
}
class Bar {
  new Foo(5) + Nil    // required: Foo
  val v = new Foo(5)
  v + Nil             // required: Bar.this.v.This (which expands to) Foo
}
```
The difference between the two errors is related to #9156. In the second case, the existence of the stable prefix `v` for the type means we don't need to capture an existential for `this` in an asSeenFrom, which ends up dealiasing `This` to `Foo`.

It seems a poor design to use the private type alias in the signature of a public method. We don't prevent that outright. Why not?

Using a smaller example:

```scala
trait Test {
  private type T = Int
  val t: T
}
```

`checkNoEscaping` detects that the RHS of line 3 contains a hidden symbol. But, rather than issuing the error, it instead discards that hidden symbol and continues analysing as though it you wrote `val t: Int`.

```scala
            case TypeRef(_, sym, args) =>
              checkNoEscape(sym)
              if (!hiddenSymbols.isEmpty && hiddenSymbols.head == sym &&
                  sym.isAliasType && sameLength(sym.typeParams, args)) {
                hiddenSymbols = hiddenSymbols.tail
                t.dealias
              } else t
```

The `sameLength` check smells funny, and reveals an inconsistency when you introduce tcpoly:

```scala
trait Test {
  private type T[_] = Int
  val t: M[T] // error: private type T escapes its defining scope as part of type M[Test.this.T]
}
trait M[N[_]]
```

But after we admit `val t: T`, no further attempt is made to actually typecheck it as `val t: Int`, which would be needed to avoid it showing up down the line in a "found / required" error message.

This dealiasing-rather-than-forbidding dates back to the dawn of existential types: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/8414ebada9615aac0e8b436e7bdbeee5986ccaa3

Next steps to improve on this would be:
  - make checkNoEscaping stricter (ie, no dealiasing to avoid the errors) to see what breaks. This ought to pretty quickly reverse engineer the motivation.
  - (maybe) add a stricter mode to the compiler to turn it off.
I guess https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/IndexedSeqView.scala offers an adequate illustration of why one might want to do this. Note that you couldn't make the type alias public even if you were inclined to do so because of variance. So every one of those Thises would be IndexedSeqView\[A, Coll\], with all that that implies.
```scala
trait IndexedSeqView[A, +Coll] ... {
  private[this] type This = IndexedSeqView[A, Coll]

  override def filter(p: A => Boolean): This       
  override def init: This                          
  override def drop(n: Int): This                  
  override def take(n: Int): This                  
  override def slice(from: Int, until: Int): This  
  override def dropWhile(p: A => Boolean): This    
  override def takeWhile(p: A => Boolean): This    
  override def span(p: A => Boolean): (This, This) 
  override def splitAt(n: Int): (This, This)       
  override def reverse: This                       
}
```
I don't think a self-respecting language can make someone type IndexedSeqView\[A, Coll\] twelve times in ten lines.
Good point. We just about want:

```scala
@inline private[this] type This = IndexedSeqView[A, Coll]
```

I'm still not sure if `private type ` or `private[this] type` really makes sense as the trigger for this. (Then again, it is no worse than `final val /**notype**/` for constant folding.)
