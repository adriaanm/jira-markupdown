I just started learning Scala. But, I know a whole lot of programming and have been addicted to Java for quite some time.

Basically, I believe {{getClass()}} should always be preferred over {{instanceof}}. Symmetry being one. The other is that there really is no rational use case for {{instanceof}} (_allowing an instance of the subclass to be equal to an instance of the superclass_). In 99 % of all use cases, if we add a subclass into our type system, then the subclass will add state. +Perhaps+ not more state then the type itself. But, +type is state+. Simply put it: A dog is not a duck even if it is well behaved enough to walk and sound like one. I argue that any OO-language should always strive to mimic the real world as closely as possible.

I understand the complexity of the nature, but it saddens me a bit to see that this issue has been marked resolved. We should put a lot of effort into making the best out of Scala.
