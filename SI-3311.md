Whenever I want to switch off the compiler options Xwarninit, Ywarn-dead-code, Ywarn-shadowing and/or Ywarn-catches in Eclipse's preferences or in my project's Scala compiler settings, they re-enable themselves magically, i.e. when I disable those options, click OK and then open the settings again, the checkboxes are again checked. I tried deleting the settings files in the project as well as in the workspace metadata, reinstalled the plug-in, different workspace, it stays the same.

Happens on:
Mac (Eclipse Classic), Version: 3.5.2, Build id: M20100211-1343
Windows Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, Version: 1.2.2.20100216-1730, Build id: 20100218-1602

Both on the RC1 and on today's nightly, 2.8.0.r21592-b20100415035050.
