```scala
  ~> cat S.scala
package p

class S {
  private def foo = 1
  private[p] def bar = 2
  def baz = 3
  private[this] def qux = 4
  protected def quux = 5
}
  ~> /usr/local/scala-2.8.0.Beta1-RC1/bin/scalac S.scala         
  ~> /usr/local/scala-2.8.0.Beta1-RC1/bin/scalap -classpath . p.S
package p
class S extends java.lang.Object with scala.ScalaObject {
  def this() = { /* compiled code */ }
  def bar : scala.Int = { /* compiled code */ }
  def baz : scala.Int = { /* compiled code */ }
  protected def quux : scala.Int = { /* compiled code */ }
}
```

"protected" is preserved, but all of the other information is lost. perhaps it's showing the Java access levels instead of the Scala access levels.
well I'm glad to hear there was **something** in my bug report that wasn't bogus :-)
