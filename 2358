I tested a fresh installation of Vista x64, using JDK 6 update 17. To be on the safe side, I installed Java in a path with no whitespaces (just in case). The command line provided prints "hello" as expected with both 2.7.7 and a recent 2.8.0 nightly. All seems to work. I am closing the ticket, please let me know if you still encounter this problem.
