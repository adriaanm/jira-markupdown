OK - here we go. I've attached a number of files. The behaviour only seems to manifest itself when scalac is not also compiling the Enum.

WriteEnum.scala - if you compile & run this, it will generate a file C:/tmp/SI8531/foobar/MyEnum.java (I've attached this file)

Open a command prompt on C:/tmp/SI8531 and run the following:

C:\tmp\SI8531>javac foobar\MyEnum.java
C:\tmp\SI8531>jar cvf foobar.jar foobar/MyEnum.class
added manifest
adding: foobar/MyEnum.class(in = 10238) (out= 4603)(deflated 55%)

(I've attached foobar.jar so you can skip this step)

Now try and compile SI8531.scala with foobar.jar on the classpath - it takes **ages**. (Equivalently, you can skip the creation of the JAR and just compile SI8531 with the directory C:/tmp/SI8531 on the classpath)
