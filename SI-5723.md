checkout master, build pack, then run the following. works when source file order is switched.

```scala
lamppc11:scala luc$ build/pack/bin/scalac -d tmp src/library/scala/text/Document.scala src/library/scala/deprecated.scala
error: error while loading TraversableOnce, Missing dependency 'bad reference while unpickling /Users/luc/scala/scala/build/pack/lib/scala-library.jar(scala/collection/TraversableOnce.class): term init$default$2 not found in deprecated.type', required by /Users/luc/scala/scala/build/pack/lib/scala-library.jar(scala/collection/TraversableOnce.class)
one error found
lamppc11:scala luc$ 
```
To me it looks like something is forcing annotations earlier than they used to be, which leads to it looking for init$default$2 on the synthetic deprecated companion before it has come to exist.
I think this is probably due to 77b577a5ae for #5543.  I'm checking now, if so I'll revert it.
