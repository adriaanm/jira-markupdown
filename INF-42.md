when sitting behind a firewall and navigating to trac you get the browser aswer:

"Error - ... Check of certificate for *lampsvn.epfl.ch:443* has failed. The follwong error occurred: revocation status unresolvable (depth = 0), revocation status unresolvable (depth = 1), *unable to get issuer certificate*. Reported by Mcafee Web Gateway 6.8.7 Build 9396"

It would be fine you could resolve this soon. Thanks.
We moved to Jira, with a scala-lang.org domain and certificate.
