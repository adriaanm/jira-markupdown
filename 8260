Paul, do you still have your issue/6260 branch around? I'd be interested to compare approaches.

Incidentally, I was motivated to fix this problem because I'm extending bridging to Mixin to try to fix SI-3452, and that got tripped up when mixing DeprectedPredef.any2ArrowAssoc into Predef.

{code}
def any2ArrowAssoc[A](x: A): ArrowAssoc[A]
{code}
