There's no way to tell the compiler, "No, I really do want a dollar sign in this string" without turning off the warning for the rest of the strings.  This leads to weird hacks like string interpolating a string which you normally wouldn't have string interpolated in order to get rid of the warning.
lit"x$$y$z" would work for me, as long as it *didn't* error if z happened to be a value.
Moses: SI-8476 is about the same problem, so it seems better to me to have a single ticket for discussing possible solutions.
