I find it useful, and pretty straightforward. Maybe it can trim an hour or two from your efforts. Here's a guide I prepared: Debugging Scalac in five minutes flat:

You can do something similar with an IntelliJ project based on the checked-out sources of scala; in that case I tend to add `-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005` to JAVA_OPTS before running `scalac`, then connect to it with a Remote Debug configuration.

Of course the biggest time saver is to whittle down a five line reproduction before diving into the compiler internals, but I think you've already internalized this life skill.
