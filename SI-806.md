I’m on Mac OS X Leopard. Installed Mono project, Scala, then scala-msil.

Compiled (and ran) a 'hello world' program successfully using scalac, (and an equivalent one in C# using Mono). However, trying to compile it in scalac-net causes an exception in the compiler. Stack trace shown below.

Hi

I can't reproduce the problem, scalac-net and scala-net work for me (Also OS X Leopard, Mono 1.9) Three points:

1) I had to replace the {{mscorlib.dll}} that comes with the scala package with the one of the installed Mono version:

{code}
$$> ~/scala/dist/lib/mscorlib.dll ~/scala/dist/lib/mscorlib.dll.old
$$> cp /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Home/lib/mono/1.0/mscorlib.dll ~/scala/dist/lib/
{code}

2) There's a special character in the String of your example, namely the {{’}} in {{you've}}. Maybe its a problem of source file encoding?

3) In the example you give, you're using {{scalac-net}} to run the code, which is wrong. You should use {{scala-net}} (without the "c"). Is this only a typo in the description on trac?

Cheers: Lukas
Thanks for the quick response.

However, unfortunately, I’m still seeing the problem:

* No, it is supposed to be “scalac-net” in the example. The point is that plain “scalac” (i.e. compiling to JVM) works fine, but “scalac-net” (i.e. compiling to MIL) breaks, on the same source code.

* I first of all removed the Unicode character from the source code, so that it's plain ASCII. Still get the same problem.

* I tried replacing mscorlib.dll with the mono/2.1 and then the mono/1.0 versions of mscorlib.dll. Doesn't help. Exactly the same stack trace.


Any ideas? As far as I know there isn’t anything particularly weird about my installation. Home directory is mounted on NFS. That’s the only thing I can thing might be different from any other Leopard/iMac setup. In case it’s relevant, JVM is 1.5.0_13-b05-237.


Oh, I have Scala installed at "/usr/local/scala" (soft link to "/usr/local/scala-2.7.0-RC2-2.7.0-RC2/").

PATH includes "/usr/local/scala/bin"
MANPATH includes "/usr/local/scala/man"
