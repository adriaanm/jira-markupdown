You're right. Be patient I'm really a newbie.

I tried to reduce the problem to the minimum code which still give the mentioned error. I attached the 2 reduced classes (which do not make much sense anymore ...) with a java dependency.

The compiling works if:
- I delete 1 of the import lines in importer.scala   (which are all btw unused)
- I compile only the importer.scala file (without the importerGui.scala)
- I compile both with scala 2.7.7

Maybe the problem is by the fact that the object importer has the same name as the package? Anyway it compiles under 2.7.7.

I hope this may be more helpful for you.
Cheers
