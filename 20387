{{AssertionError}} s, being outside the list of fatal errors defined for {{NonFatal}}, are caught by code matching on {{NonFatal}} and with the {{Try}} construct - making it easy for failed assertions to be inappropriately handled or silently discarded where they should be considered fatal application failures and fail loudly to inform the developer/tester that a program assumption/assertion has been broken and requires remediation.
