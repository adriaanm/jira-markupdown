I simply have no menu option to move an item, either from the *Right Click -> Refactor* menu in the Package explorer or the *Right Click -> Move* option in the Project Explorer view.

I can reproduce this by 
 1. Install a clean version of eclipse classic (linux 64 bit by the way - forgot to mention that).
 2. Install the Scala nightly build from http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-nightly.
 3. Create a new Java project and add a class to it.
 4. In the Package Explorer navigate to the new class and right click, then choose _Refactor_
 5. The top two menu items should be _Rename..._ and _Move..._ I only have _Rename..._

I get the same behaviour whether or not I have the JDT weaving installed or not.

The error log shows nothing at all and no log file is generated in the eclipse install directory or the workspace.
