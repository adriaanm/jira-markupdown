The case as described regressed in M3.

I think I still have my "I'm a lubber not a typer" t-shirt from back then.

The case with non-identical alternatives, and who ever needs that, is being unassigned and kicked down the road to foster work stealing...

I don't suppose we could change the title?  I lose three months' life expectancy every time I see "regression in f interpolator."
