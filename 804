Just create something as simple as 

{code}
class Click {
  def foo = 1
  def bar = foo
}
{code}

Build it, restart the IDE, try click to foo in bar definition - nothing. Then edit at any way (add/delete space, for example) the file - Ctrl-click begins to work.

Resume: Ctrl-click begins to work after a file was changed by editor during the IDE session. This situation doesn't depend on click-target source - the same Scala file, a Scala file in the same project or a Scala file in some another project from this one depends on.

The issue doesn't depend on Eclipse version (takes place with 3.3.1.1 and 3.4).
