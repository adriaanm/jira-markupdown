I think that It is not lazy to call GenTraversableLike#tail in [LinearSeqOptimized#lengthCompare|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.10.0-M7/src/library/scala/collection/LinearSeqOptimized.scala#L255].
Just a note on laziness: 

While we attempt to be as lazy as possible in stream, it's more than likely that size/take/indexOf, etc. may reify one too many terms of the stream.   This is the case in *many* of the implementations because of how 'escaping' loops work.   We offer no guarantees on *when* we evaluate things, only that we defer as long as we can.

I'm migrating this to an enhancement, since the current behavior isn't 'broken'.   That said, we'll see if there's anything we can do to improve the laziness.
Yes, I collectly agree with you.
Stream's laziness isn't specified by any documents. We should not assume many assumption(contract) of methods.

I think that almost *early evaluation* is caused by unnecessary GenTraversableLike#tail method calling.
It is good to remove such method calling for other classes without need *unnecessary* method calliing, maybe such class dosen't exist.
If you want to systematically find methods that should be overriden methods, reflection is pretty handy:

scala> val u = reflect.runtime.universeu: scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse = scala.reflect.runtime.JavaUniverse@5d38c394

scala> val t = u.typeOf[Stream[Any]]
t: u.Type = scala.Stream[Any]

scala> println(t.members.map(sym => (sym.name.decoded, sym.owner.fullName, t.baseType(sym.owner), t.baseClasses.indexOf(sym.owner))).toSeq.sortBy(t => (-t._4, t._1)).map { case (name, bt, _, _) => f"$name%20s inherited from ${bt.toString.replace("scala.collection", "s.c")}" }.mkString("\n"))

For Stream, I'm almost willing to add a test case that pins down this output, so that each new method added above it fails the build and forces us to consciously choose whether or not to override.
