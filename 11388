If I opened a PR against the compiler it would only be for the purpose of getting it into the typelevel compiler (since there's no chance of me taking it to completion) which seems like an abuse of the PR queue.

I believe the code is unusually clear and shouldn't be difficult for someone with higher optimism to adapt into a scala PR.
