I think the correct fix is to change the {{readResolve}} method of the nested object to the following:

{code}
def readResolve() = {
  if ($outer.attr$module == null) this
  else $outer.attr$module
}
{code}

Since the field ({{attr$module}}) is private, we might create another name-mangled accessor for it (instead of making the field public)

Q: should the method be synchronized?

Lukas, what you propose fixes this problem, but we have to additionally make sure that all the objects that see {{Outer}}, agree on the *same instance* of the nested object {{attr}}.
If we are deserializing only an {{Outer}} instance along with its {{attr}} object, then this will indeed be the case.

However, there might be multiple instances of the {{attr}} object created per an {{Outer}} class instance if some other code invokes the {{attr()}} method between the time when the proposed {{attr.readResolve}} returns {{this}} and the time when {{Outer}} class is fully deserialized. The only situation where this could happen (that I can think of) is if the nested object has a custom {{readObject}} method:

{code}
class Outer extends Serializable {
  def foo = attr
  object attr extends Serializable {
    println("Ctor!")
    var x = "default"
    override def toString = s"attr($x)"
    private def readObject(in: ObjectInputStream) {
      println("dro begin")
      in.defaultReadObject
      println("dro done")
      foo
    }
  }
  override def toString = "Outer - " + attr
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Outer

scala> val outer = new Outer
Ctor!
outer: Outer = Outer - attr(default)

scala> outer.attr.x = "custom"
outer.attr.x: String = custom

scala> serializeDeserialize(outer)
dro begin
dro done
Ctor!
res11: Outer = Outer - attr(default)
{code}

To avoid this situation, the {{readResolve}} method should set the {{attr$module}} field the first time that the singleton instance is used:

{code}
def readResolve() = {
  if ($outer.attr$module == null) {
    $outer.attr$module = this
    this
  } else $outer.attr$module
}
{code}

I would avoid synchronization here, since it could result in subtle deadlocks, but does not buy you much.
In fact, if the field checked by the {{attr()}} accessor is really not a volatile, then the initialization of the nested object is not thread-safe already.
Thanks for you comment, Alex.

I'm not sure your suggestion would help in the situation you describe though. It seems {{readResolve}} is called only after {{readObject}} returns (example below). So we'd get this sequence of events:
* start de-serializing the {{Outer}} instance
* start de-serializing the {{attr$}} instance for the {{attr$module}} field
* invoke {{attr$.readObject}}
** invokes the {{outer$.attr}} getter, which finds the {{attr$module}} field still being {{null}}, so a new module instance is created (constructor side-effects!)
* invoke {{attr$.readResolve}}
** the {{outer$.attr$module}} field is non-null, so its value is returned

I don't see a way to prevent invoking the module constructor if the module is accessed by a custom {{readObject}}.

{code}
case class C(var s: String) {
  private def readObject(in: ObjectInputStream): Unit = {
    println("Before Default")
    println(this)
    in.defaultReadObject
    println("After Default")
    println(this)
    this.s = "readObject"
    println(this)
  }

  private def readResolve(): Object = {
    println("readResolve")
    C("readResolve")
  }
}
{code}

Quick answer to whether it should be synchronized: no, as far as I can see.

Long answer:
I didn't check what gets generated, but if the following accessor is generated:

{code}
  // generated accesssor:
  // public attr()LOuter$attr$ = {
  //   if (attr$module == null) attr$lzycompute()
  //   else attr$module
  // }
{code}

and at the same time, the {{attr$module}} field is not volatile, then the lazy accessors for nested objects are not thread-safe -- it is possible that some thread reads a non-{{null}} {{attr$module}} reference to a nested object whose constructor did not yet complete (because the statements inside the {{synchronized}} block can be reordered with the constructor body of singleton object).

This bug could manifest itself:
a) during concurrent access to {{Outer}}'s {{attr}} field
b) possibly during serialization if the reference to the {{Outer}} object somehow escapes to another thread

So, to fix this bug, the accessor method does not need to be synchronized.
However, the long-term fix should be to make {{attr$module}} volatile:
- this, along with the existing {{synchronized}} in {{attr$lzycompute}} fix the problem (a)
- if you also care about {{Outer}} object reference escaping to another thread, this should also fix (b), as far as I can see
after some thought and i-don't-tell-how-many-hours of working [on the prototype|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4668] for [my initial idea|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-9375?focusedCommentId=72717&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-72717], i'm quite convinced now that the right solution is simply to NOT emit a readResolve method. Submitted in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4671.
Wow, nice. That sounds about right. It should not be necessary to ensure singletoness on the nested object, since both the nested object and its surrounding object are fresh and unique after deserialization anyway.

Still, I believe that my comment about the {{attr$module}} being volatile stands - that would make nested singleton objects more consistent with the top-level singletons.
