We will have a complete scaladoc tutorial on [http://docs.scala-lang.org] shortly. Until then, citing the scaladoc tool:

Quick crash course on using Scaladoc links
==========================================
 - Links relative to the current template should work. Make sure to use fully qualified names 
if the member is inherited into other templates or is inherited by implicit conversions (as 
they will be expanded relative to the containing template)
Disambiguating terms and types: Prefix terms with '$' and types with '!' in case both names are in use:
 - [[scala.collection.immutable.List!.apply class List's apply method]] and
 - [[scala.collection.immutable.List$.apply object List's apply method]]
Disambiguating overloaded members: If a term is overloaded, you can indicate the first part of its signature followed by *:
 - [[[scala.collection.immutable.List$.fill[A](Int)(?A):List[A]* Fill with a single parameter]]]
 - [[[scala.collection.immutable.List$.fill[A](Int,Int)(?A):List[List[A]]* Fill with a two parameters]]]
Notes: 
 - you can use any number of matching square brackets to avoid interference with the signature
 - you can use \. to escape dots in prefixes (don't forget to use * at the end to match the signature!)
 - you can use \# to escape hashes, otherwise they will be considered as delimiters, like dots.
