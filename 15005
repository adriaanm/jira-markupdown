hi guys,

Just wanted to drop a note that the Feb 10 development build of the Eclipse plugin seems crazy toxic. After updating, my Eclipse closed out, then started in a strange state (all views could not load), then wouldn't restart again until I passed -clean on the command line. 

After loading with -clean, type search (ctrl-shift-T) would hang at 97%. After uninstalling the plugin, everything cooled down.

I've never had problems before.

My Eclipse info is below.

Thanks for the plugin! 
Brien
