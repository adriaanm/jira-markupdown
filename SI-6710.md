Compiling the attached Test.scala class (against 2.10.0-RC2) with the -Xprint:jvm flag indicates that the AST for the null comparisons is:

{code}
final def apply(): Object = {
  scala.this.Predef.println(scala.Boolean.box(scala.Int.unbox(null).==(0)));
  scala.this.Predef.println(scala.Boolean.box(null.==(null)));
  ...
{code}

Decompiling the resulting Test.class (using Jad v1.5.8g [1]) shows that the actual runtime calls are:

{code}
public final Object apply() {
  Predef$.MODULE$.println(BoxesRunTime.boxToBoolean(BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(null) == 0));
  Object _tmp = null;
  Predef$.MODULE$.println(BoxesRunTime.boxToBoolean(null == null));
  ...
{code}

However, scala.Int.unbox [2] and BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt [3] differ in their behaviour with respect to null. scala.Int.unbox behaves like Java Integer-to-int unboxing and throws a NullPointerException, whereas BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt converts null to 0.

{code}
def unbox(x: java.lang.Object): Int = x.asInstanceOf[java.lang.Integer].intValue()
{code}

vs

{code}
public static int unboxToInt(Object i) {
  return i == null ? 0 : ((java.lang.Integer)i).intValue();
}
{code}

SI-602 contains a discussion on whether the runtime behaviour is actually desired; this issue simply suggests amending the definition of scala.Int.unbox to match runtime behaviour and to document the method's behaviour on null input.

Yes, it appears that the the implementation of {{unbox}} is now never used. This might have happened when we switched to the new GenASM backend. I'd have to check with Miguel to be sure.

Here is where the backend chooses the {{unboxToInt}} implementation:
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/GenASM.scala#L1298
https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/GenASM.scala#L2485

In that case, your suggested patch looks innocent and essentially just documentation.
object Int's unbox(Object) is used by Erasure:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Definitions.scala#L101

  https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/Erasure.scala#L657

and it's also used in other places via `definitions.isUnbox`

One of those usages reads:

{noformat}
          /** Can't always remove a Box(Unbox(x)) combination because the process of boxing x
           *  may lead to throwing an exception.
           *
           *  This is important for specialization: calls to the super constructor should not box/unbox specialized
           *  fields (see TupleX). (ID)
           */
          case Apply(boxFun, List(arg)) if isUnbox(tree.symbol) && safeToRemoveUnbox(arg.tpe.typeSymbol) =>
{noformat}


Therefore, changing object Int's unbox(Object) is "non trivial".


> Therefore, changing object Int's unbox(Object) is "non trivial".

Aha! Interesting. Thanks for explaining, Miguel.

Do you have any suggestions for creating a test that could validate that the change does not break existing behaviour?

Also, even if the method *is*, in fact, called, is it necessary that the behaviour differ from the actual runtime behaviour of Int unboxing?
Regarding the question why -Xprint:jvm shows 

{noformat}
scala.this.Predef.println(scala.Boolean.box(scala.Int.unbox(null).==(0)))
{noformat}

but the bytecode contains an invocation of {{BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt()}}

{noformat}
   4:	invokestatic	#76; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt:(Ljava/lang/Object;)I
{noformat}

That's because -Xprint:jvm actually prints trees right after CleanUp, and the rewriting that's being chased here takes place in GenICode, whose output can be seen via {{-Xprint-icode}} (excerpt follows)

{noformat}
  def comp_zero(): Unit {
  locals: variable boxed2
  startBlock: 1
  blocks: [1,2,3,4]
  
  1: 
    10	LOAD_MODULE object Predef
    10	CONSTANT(null)
    10	UNBOX INT
    10	CONSTANT(0)
    10	CJUMP (INT)EQ ? 2 : 3
    
{noformat}

Sorry about the confusion. It's "Not a bug".

We can never rule out code out there with hardcoded calls to object Int's unbox(). As to documentation, any pull request against scala.Int would have to cope with

{noformat}
// DO NOT EDIT, CHANGES WILL BE LOST.
{noformat}

because that file is automatically generated.
> any pull request against scala.Int would have to cope with
> {{// DO NOT EDIT, CHANGES WILL BE LOST.}}

I was curious about that too ;-) I just was not able to find *where* this code is actually generated from. Do you have any hints?

> We can never rule out code out there with hardcoded calls to object Int's unbox()

How would you make this call? From the REPL I tried calling {{scala.Int.unbox(null)}} directly [1], and it seems the behaviour is actually that of BoxesRunTime.

Thanks, Jason! Egads: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/cmd/gen/AnyVals.scala#L232 makes this look a whole lot bigger. Hm...
> Status CLOSED, Resolution Not a Bug

Perhaps one final question, if you would be so kind: if this is "as intended", what then is the *purpose* of the {{@unboxImpl@}} definition [1] in the AnyVal classes? 

If the method is not supposed to document what actually happens when unboxing takes place, what is it for?

Thanks!

Yay! Glad to see we now feel the inconsistency here is weird enough to take the risk of changing the behaviour.

Thanks, [~rytz] and [~moors]!
