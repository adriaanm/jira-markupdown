Unfortunately there isn't much we can do about this one.

Summoning a type tag for `this.type` gives a "context sensitive" type, `ThisType(symbolOf[T])`.
```
scala> import reflect.runtime.universe._
import reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> class T { def t = typeTag[this.type] }; showRaw(new T().t.tpe)
defined class T
res36: String = ThisType(T)
```

The code that does this is the expansion of the `typeTag` macro. It has no knowledge of the prefix that you will later use to call this method.
