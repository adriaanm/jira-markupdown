This issue is related to changes made under ticket scala/bug#1303 where several default implementations for implicit parameters were created for common objects; however, there is no default support for the Ordered trait or java.lang.Comparable. Below is example code (modeled after a 2.7.5 to 2.8.0 "regression" found in the sbaz code base):

File name: src/bug.scala
```scala
package top

class Text(val value: String) extends Ordered[Text] {
  def compare(that: Text) = value.compare(that.value)
}

object Index {
  import scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap
  val tree = TreeMap.empty[Text, String]
}
```

Compiling this yields the following error with 2.8.0:
```scala
src/bug.scala:9: error: could not find implicit value for parameter ord:Ordering[top.Text].
  val tree = TreeMap.empty[Text, String]
```
