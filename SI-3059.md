Happens on revision r20862.
Given the classes A and B in separate files:

```scala
class A extends B {
    private def getBar = List(1,2,3)
    lazy val bar: List[Int] = getBar
}
```

```scala
abstract class B {
    private def getFoo = 12
    lazy val foo: Int = getFoo
}
```

if you compile them together in resident mode you will get:
```scala
javap -classpath . A
Compiled from "A.scala"
public class A extends B implements scala.ScalaObject{
    public volatile int bitmap$$0;
    public scala.collection.immutable.List bar();
    public A();
}
```
but then if you compile just A.scala: 
```scala
javap -classpath . A
Compiled from "A.scala"
public class A extends B implements scala.ScalaObject{
    public scala.collection.immutable.List bar();
    public A();
}
```
because A uses now the bitmap of B class. This causes excessive change notification in build manager (for example with Global.scala): 
```scala
scala scala.tools.nsc.interactive.BuildManagerTest src/A.scala src/B.scala
compiling Set(src/A.scala, src/B.scala)
Changes: Map()
builder > src/A.scala
compiling Set(src/A.scala)
Changes: Map(class A -> List(Removed(Definition(A.bitmap$$0))))
```
There is also a way to get incorrect code generated with lazy vals and the build manager, but the resolution of #3038 might obviate these issues.
(In r23323) Closes #3059, #3895 (the only difference between this and r23232 is the forced info transformation that ensures that nested objects are viewed as lazy vals). sbt integration requires new starr for this commit to work.
