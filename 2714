This is a duplicate of scala/bug#4035. The reason why we haven't yet fixed it is because protected is hard to combine when you are dealing for example with self-types. And for other cases we need accessors to be generated which is also non trivial in this case.
To be precise code generator currently only issues private or public access modifiers.
