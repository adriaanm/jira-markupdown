You can get test case project from https://github.com/ttyusupov/slick-examples/tree/hlist_compile_issue:
```scala
git clone -b hlist_compile_issue https://github.com/ttyusupov/slick-examples slick-examples-ttyusupov
```

Then just run script which will repeat clean+compilation until it is failed:
```scala
cd slick-examples-ttyusupov
chmod +x repeat_build.sh
./repeat_build.sh
```

For me it failed at least at 3rd try and at most about 20th.
