I find myself frequently using maps to aggregate data in such a fashion that I need to perform an update of the map with a function of the current value associated with a key.

As such, I would like to request a convenience method with the following implementation be added as an overload of the "updated" method on scala.collection.immutable.Map:

def updated[B1 >: B](a: A)(f: Option[B] => B1): Map[A, B1] =    this + (a -> f(this.get(a)))


I don't think your code gets much shorter with that feature than if you used
{code}
   table get a match { 
     case Some(v) => table + (a -> f(v)) 
     case None => table
   }
{code}
