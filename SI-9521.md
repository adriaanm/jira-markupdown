I have a library 
```scala
object Assert {
 def usageError(msg: String) = throw new Abort(msg)
}
```
The following always produces a dead-code warning when -Ywarn-dead-code is enabled.
```scala
lazy val foo = Assert.usageError("not to be used.")
```
Clearly this is not dead code. 
Is this issue the same as #3072 ? Seems there that lazy val foo: Nothing = throw.... does not cause a dead code warning, but lazy val foo: Unit = throw.... does cause the warning.

I think my situation is same as the latter. In my example, lazy val foo is an override of def foo: FooType in a base class.
A.P. Marki: You said "The warning is non-trivial because if the init throws, the lazy val is still uninitialized, and the init will run again on subsequent invocations."

Are you saying that since this code will, of necessity throw, then the dead code is the code which assigns a value to the lazy val foo ? That "code" is invisible to the scala programmer. 

To me there's no question that there is no dead code here. Given a trait:
```scala
trait B {
   def foo: FooType
}
```
I can create many polymorphic descendents of this. 
```scala
class C extends B {
  override lazy val foo = new FooType
}
class D extends B {
  // On this class, lazy val foo doesn't make any sense to use
  override lazy val foo = throw new Exception("don't use this on D objects")
}
```
Clearly the above makes sense. If I have an object reference of type B, then demanding the B.foo lazy val might return a value, or might throw an exception.

In the OO fat-interface pattern, one often has methods/lazy-vals that are expressed on classes but not implementable, so an explicit throw is the only sensible thing to put in them. 

So there should be no dead-code warning associated with the class D lazy val foo. 
No, not the same issue; anyway, the other issue progressed.

Overriding without a result type narrows the result to what is inferred for the RHS, i.e., Nothing. There is a ticket to make it not narrow the type,

This isn't something you'd do in real life, but since it's almost Halloween:
```scala
scala> class C { def c: String = "" }
defined class C

scala> class D extends C { override lazy val c = ??? }
<console>:11: warning: dead code following this construct
       class D extends C { override lazy val c = ??? }
                                                 ^
defined class D

scala> class D extends C { override lazy val c: String = (??? : Unit).asInstanceOf[String] }
defined class D
```
