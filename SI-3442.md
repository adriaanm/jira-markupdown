Attempting to use java.io.Console to read a password throws the repl into weirdness and only reads in a single character:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val console = System.console
console: java.io.Console = java.io.Console@12781046

scala> console.readPassword("Enter pw: ")
Enter pw: 
res0: Array[Char] = Array(p)

scala> rreess00((00))

res1: Char = p

scala> ::qquuiitt
```
Also, when calls to the regular readLine method are made, the characters are not echoed to the screen:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> Console.readLine("Enter stuff: ")
Enter stuff: res0: String = stuff

scala> :quit
```
Both of these work as expected if run as a script instead of from the repl.  Scripts are attached.
This works, and as it does, realistically I'm unlikely to pursue this without a very specific diagnosis as to how it should be changed.
```scala
Console.withIn(System.in) { Console.readLine("Enter stuff:") }
```
As far as I can tell, the `Console.withIn` thing doesn't solve the java.io.Console problem at all - you can still only type a single character:
```scala
scala> Console.withIn(System.in) {System.console.readLine("username: ")}
username: res10: java.lang.String = a

scala> bcde
```
This matters less for `System.console.readLine` since you can always use `Console.readLine` instead, but what are you supposed to use instead of `System.console.readPassword`?
I guess I misunderstood the comment "this works". I thought the ticket was moved to low priority because the `Console.withIn` thing was being proffered as a workaround (but it's not). Sorry for the confusion.

Anyway, here's a workaround (using jline which appears to be included by scala already):
```scala
scala> new jline.ConsoleReader().readLine('*')
******
res0: java.lang.String = abdefg
```
Closing since there's a workaround. We're moving to vanilla jline, btw: #7604
In 2.10+, this workaround doesn't seem to work, but you can just get into *power mode* and then
```java
scala> repl.in.readLine("enter something: ")
enter something: hello world
res0: String = hello world
```

If only that readLine method was used as the default readLine in the REPL...
