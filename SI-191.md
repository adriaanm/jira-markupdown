It would be highly useful to allow ScalaDoc to link particular packages (e.g., net.liftweb.*) to external URLs such that creating ScalaDoc for a lift project would allow linking to the (soon to be) publicly available ScalaDocs for lift as well as the JavaDocs for Servlet, etc.

If you want a more formal specification (rather than a random wish), I'll be happy to provide suggestions about command line arguments.

Also, I don't know if this component is nsc (the compile) or something else, so sorry if I mis-categorized it.
Duplicate of SI-3884.
SI-3884 concerns adding links to non-API documentation.  This bug requests the much needed ability to automatically link to other API documentation not generated at the same time.
Hi Simon,

Any progress on this? SI-5350 suggests using [-link|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#link], like in Javadoc. Will mark it as a duplicate.
