The following snippet slays the compiler:
```scala
class Foo {
  def duck()(times: Int) = this
}

object Bar {  
  def duckDuckGo[T](t: T { 
    def duck() /* (times: Int) */ : T 
  }) {}

  duckDuckGo(new Foo())
}
```
```
uncaught exception during compilation: scala.reflect.internal.Types$NoCommonType
error: scala.reflect.internal.Types$NoCommonType: lub/glb of incompatible types: (implicit times: Int)Foo and Foo
```

There were a couple of related errors I came upon whilst trimming down the reproducible, but for now, this seems to be the core issue.
