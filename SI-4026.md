Calls to TreeMap.from, TreeMap.to, TreeMap.range run in time O(n) with respect of number of the items in the returned subtree. 

Valuable comment from Nathan Bronson, I got on the scala-user discussion list:

"The underlying RedBlack's range implementation is O(log n), but
TreeMap.rangeImpl then immediately calls RedBlack.count on the subrange, which is O(n).  Perhaps RedBlack.NonEmpty.count should be a val instead of a def?"

Expected behaviour: the time should be O(log n) with respect to the number of all items in the tree. 

Reproducibility: always. 

How to reproduce: Create a large TreeMap and call one of the mentioned methods, to return a large portion of the tree. 

What versions of the following are you using?
Scala: 2.8.1.final
Java: 1.6.0 update 22 (both server and client)
Operating system: Windows Vista Home Premium

Actually, that was a different issue. The original {{RedBlack}} code, the one that went into 2.8.0 and 2.8.1, was broken. The temporary fix was O(n), but never got released (as far as I know -- unless it went into 2.8.1 after all).

The problem referred to is here ({{scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap}}):

{code}
    val ntree = tree.range(from,until)
    new TreeMap[A,B](ntree.count, ntree)
{code}


Specifically, that {{count}} on {{ntree}}. On the other hand, turning {{NonEmpty}}'s {{count}} into a {{val}} sounds reasonable. It can always be counted in constant time, because it only needs to add the counts of its (at most) two subtrees. And if those subtree's {{count}} have already been computed... And, of course, since the collection is immutable, there's no need to recompute.

It _would_ make the memory footprint of {{RedBlack}} heavier. And if we went this way, I'd be much in favor of putting in a depth val too -- I missed it on {{range}}, and it usually helps with red&black algorithms.
