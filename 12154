@heathermiller, while I agree that the message states that it is a value and points to scala.language instead of scala.languageFeature, the natural inclination when you receive this warning is to google for the more unique keyword: reflectiveCalls*. Which, this leads you to the trait that I referenced. At which point, you are blinded by confirmation bias that you found the documentation for reflectiveCalls and begin to confuse further. It ends up being a problem like finding an O instead of a 0. Scala already takes some flak when it comes to areas of confusion, so I see a change like this as a way to help shore up those areas. 

As to the origin of this issue, it comes from a customer who was exactly confused as I specified. Take that with what A. P. Mark said, along with [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20710981/where-is-the-scaladoc-for-scala-language-existentials) and there are indeed cases where people have brought this up. And, those are just the cases that are public. It is entirely possible that there many more cases where the dev finally figured it out after wasting undue time simply finding the correct documentation. Again, erring on the side of clarity couldn't hurt here.





*I realize that this is true of all language imports, I simply chose one for specificity.
