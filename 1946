Paul, the issue is that Java requires classes to define their inner classes in metadata. See for example [ยง4.7.6 of the Java 7 VM spec](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.6). If these names don't match with the actual names of classes, utilities that try to use reflection or detection to find inner classes may start to fail.
