I have two (almost sorted) lists of integers and check for equality of these lists as follows:
  1) Obtain an iterator for both lists. Call one list _left_ and the other _right_.
  2) Step through _left_ sequentially and try to match the current element of _left_ with the current element of _right_.
  3) If these two elements are equal, then keep going (i.e. return to Step 2).
  4) Otherwise, buffer the elements of _right_ that we are skipping over until we find the element of _right_ that is equal to the current element of _left_.
  5) Prepend the iterator of _right_ with the elements we skipped over to maintain the "almost sorted" property of _right_, and return to Step 2.

(The above procedure is the most efficient in my application because the two input lists are always "almost sorted" and the two lists are very large and expensive to sort.)

This is best understood with concrete code:
```scala
    val leftElems: Iterator[Int] = List(2,1,3) iterator
    var rightElems: Iterator[Int] = List(1,2,3) iterator

    while (leftElems.hasNext && rightElems.hasNext) {
      val left = leftElems.next
      var right = rightElems.next
      var done = left == right
      val bufferedRightElems = collection.mutable.Queue.empty[Int] // Buffer skipped over integers
      while (!done && rightElems.hasNext) {
        bufferedRightElems.enqueue(right)
        right = rightElems.next
        done = left == right
      }
      assert(done,"Lists do not contain the same elements")
      // The correct answers skipped over will match future conjected answers (assuming the conjected rewriting is correct) since the ordering of clauses is not strict
      rightElems = bufferedRightElems.iterator ++ rightElems // This causes stack overflow on next call to hasNext
      // rightElems = {bufferedRightElems.enqueue(rightElems.toSeq: _*); bufferedRightElems.iterator} // This works
    }
```
However, as noted in the comment calling rightElems.hasNext causes a stack overflow error.

There must be a bug in the implementation of (++) for iterators. (I am sorry I cannot offer a fix, but I am currently working towards a deadline.)
