{{groupBy}} is substantially slower in 2.12, with throughput down to as little as 60% of 2.11 on my machine.  This seems to affect all collections (Vector, List, and Array tested).

Manually inlining the {{groupBy}} code does not seem to help.  Indeed, benchmarking of {{HashMap.getOrElseUpdate}} shows a considerable decrease in throughput, possibly enough to account for the entire effect.  {{AnyRefMap}} does not appear to be affected.

Manually inlining the {{get}}, match, and {{update}} calls from {{getOrElseUpdate}} does appear to solve the issue (at least mostly).

The old bytecode in {{scala.collection.mutable.MapLike$class}} was:

{code}
  public static java.lang.Object getOrElseUpdate(scala.collection.mutable.MapLike, java.lang.Object, scala.Function0);
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: aload_1
       2: invokeinterface #35,  2           // InterfaceMethod scala/collection/mutable/MapLike.get:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/Option;

{code}

Whether these extra jumps themselves are the extra cost, or whether they prevent some JIT optimization, I have not yet investigated.  However, the bytecode appears less efficiently organized (note the swap of the exception vs return which requires one of the extra jumps in the success case).

Note--I did not see any difference in {{get}}, but maybe my test was still within the ability of the optimizer to compensate for, as Pap LÅ‘rinc reports a slowdown in `get` as well.  Alternatively, maybe it's the pattern match in conjunction that is the issue (I have not yet tested manually inlining the exact pattern match used to destructure the result of the {{get}}).
I think it might be related to the (mutable?) {{HashMap}}'s slowdown, but my benchmarks may be biased:

Creating an {{i -> i}} mutable {{Map}} and requesting each one (and separately requesting the same number of missing values) shows a slowdown in {{2.11.8}} vs {{2.12.0}}, using latest JMH, in 10/10 runs and {{1026}} values.
Again, not sure if this is the cause, as it turns out to be quite difficult for me to profile.
{code:java}
@Benchmark
public void scala_persistent_some(Blackhole bh) {
    for (int i = 0; i < CONTAINER_SIZE; i++) {
        Option<Object> value = map.get(i);
        assert !value.isEmpty();
        bh.consume(value);
    }
}

@Benchmark
public void scala_persistent_none(Blackhole bh) {
    for (int i = CONTAINER_SIZE; i < 2 * CONTAINER_SIZE; i++) {
        Option<Object> value = map.get(i);
        assert value.isEmpty();
        bh.consume(value);
    }
}
{code}

{code}


i.e. it seems to me that the {{2.12}} bytecode contains {{index}} and {{findEntry}} as default methods, while the other one seems to call a static method.
But wasn't this the whole point of the {{2.12}} rewrite, shouldn't this be faster?
[~paplorinc] - Can you check whether getOrElseUpdate is faster in your hands if the implementation is changed to the following:

{code}
    val x = get(key)
    if (x eq None) { val d = op; this(key) = d; d }
    else x.asInstanceOf[Some[V]].get
{code}

In my hands, it's full speed or faster, either when there are lots of successful lookups, or when new keys are added almost every time.
[~ichoran] Could you share a benchmark that shows the biggest difference?

I've played with a few variations in https://github.com/retronym/compiler-benchmark/commit/a2260bb927572ce606aafffed92c14ed5ffdf6bf

I don't have a clear model about what's going on here.

One observation is that the new trait encoding requires some additional indirections which can eat into HotSpot's inlining depth budget, which is by default 9. I'm trying things like looking at the effect of `-XX:MaxInlineLevel=16` in the 2.12.0 run.
[~paplorinc] I just saw your comments after I posted. 

Unfortunately we had to introduce some indirection in the dispatch of trait methods.

Hot calls into higher level methods (like `groupBy`) can run into the inliing depth limit at a slightly different spot.

That HotSpot limit is known to be a bit on the low side for historical reasons. The implementation of "lambda forms" in the java.lang.invoke implementation ran into it, but rather than raising it added special cases into HotSpot for lambda form frames.



Thanks [~ichoran]. I've tried your pattern matching unrolling, but for some reason it only slowed down my test ({{30k}} vs {{32k}} ops/s):

{code:java}
public static class Test extends Base {
    scala.collection.mutable.HashMap<Object, Object> map = HashMap$.MODULE$.empty();

    @State(Scope.Thread)
    public class Initialized {
        @Setup(Level.Invocation)
        public void initializeMutable(Base state) {
            for (int i = 0; i < state.CONTAINER_SIZE; i++) {
                map.put(i, i);
            }
        }

        @TearDown(Level.Invocation)
        public void tearDown() {
            map.clear();
        }
    }

    @Benchmark
    public void scala_persistent_some(Blackhole bh) {
        for (int i = 0; i < CONTAINER_SIZE; i++) {
            Object value = map.getOrElseUpdate(i, () -> 0);
            bh.consume(value);
        }
        assert map.size() == CONTAINER_SIZE;
    }
}
{code}

Note: I prefer testing {{Scala}} speed from {{Java}}, as the bugs we're testing might affect the outcome if we're self-diagnosing.

[~retronym], thanks for sharing your benchmarks.
It seems you were able to reproduce the {{get}} slowdown.
I usually prefer exhaustive benchmarks (i.e. one, which consumes all elements), otherwise weird biases may arise (e.g. you're not testing not-found elements, or same-bucket ones - needed, especially since the {{equals2}} appeared as hotspot also).

A viable fix would be to change {{getOrElseUpdate}} (which has a weird name ... if the map doesn't have the element, it's not an {{update}} anymore, it's a {{put}}) to calculate the index only once, and don't check for availability the second time - but this may need some interface changes also.
I would gladly create a PR for it, but I may need some guidance :)
[~retronym] - It's rather fiddly.  I keep losing the effect when I try to generalize tests because the JVM doesn't do a very robust job of fully optimizing the 2.11 code either.

However, the best I've got so far is at https://gist.github.com/Ichoran/94b4698905b905934dfd644f6cef7b4b

This is using Thyme (now up in a snapshot for 2.11 and 2.12) so I can iterate quickly on ideas.  (Note--some machines may need the {{Thyme.warmed(0.03)}} to be changed to {{Thyme.warmed(0.05)}}; the number is a target stability, and some machines never meet the smaller number.)  Given the relative lack of stability of results, though, it may be better to switch to a JMH-based test suite.  On the other hand, given the lack of stability I am uncertain how microbenchmarking results are going to translate into real-world performance.

I have created a PR with a fix and would really appreciate your feedback, [~retronym], [~ichoran]!

While the underlying problem has rather been avoided (i.e. why is {{HashMap.get}} slower in the first place and why aren't default methods inlined properly, etc), it does seem to resolve the issue of slow {{groupBy}} s.

It's my first Scala PR, all comments are very welcome! :)
I could port this to {{2.11.9}} and {{2.13.0}} once https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5537 is merged :)
Forward port was recommended by -[~ichoran]- you (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5528#issuecomment-260927187) as it may include visibility changes to the API, i.e. no need to reimplement methods from {{HashTable}}.
FYI: the build failed with {{NPE}} for my commit after merge, is it a randomly failing test, or a real one? (https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/job/scala-2.12.x-validate-test/3717/console)
[~ichoran], [~retronym], the same {{improve}} method with division instead of bit mask appears in other places also, e.g. https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/3cc99d7b4aa43b1b06cc837a55665896993235fc/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/FlatHashTable.scala#L428-L428

Also https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/460fa9d2af7ac12d5c6b0b935a02db30dc5d7cd8/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashMap.scala#L83-L83 and https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/cb1a4524d2b34605232afa083dd43f0b7d39b7a7/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashSet.scala#L180-L180 have a different hashing algorithm, mentioned in https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/1ae160037b1d2b603a20595caa44ad2ce3b8dcd6/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/HashTable.scala#L455-L455 as "quick, but bad for sequence 0-10000 - little entropy in higher bits".

Is this ok, or should I open an issue for it?

Done, thanks: https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-10084

Also, I noticed that the hashing does a manual bit rotation, changed that in a separate PR also: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5569
