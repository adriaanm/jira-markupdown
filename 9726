I agree that **interpolation** is a confusingly overloaded term in this context, but I don't see how this isn't a bug.

The language spec says about triple-quoted strings: "None of the escape sequences in (ยง1.3.6) is interpreted." Are you suggesting that putting an `s` in front of a triple-quoted string means that it's no longer a triple-quoted string? As far as I know, the escape character for Scala's prefix interpolator is `$`, so I don't see why it would override the language spec's claim that backslashes are not interpreted inside triple quotes. 

The whole point of triple-quoted strings is to disable all the quoting rules and let you paste in strings verbatim. I also don't see why it would be desirable to require escaping **only** in the case of an interpolated string, even if the language spec didn't state clearly that you don't need escaping in a triple-quoted string.
