I tried hard to find a ticket for this, as I'd be surprised not to have one already. I found related tickets #1352 and #1994, but not exactly this one.

See related [IDE ticket #1000758](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000758#/activity/ticket:)

```scala
// WithClone.java
package test;

public abstract class WithClone {
  public abstract Object clone();
}
```

```scala
// Use.scala
import test.WithClone

class Foo {
 def test(x: WithClone) {
   x.clone() 
 }
}
```
results in

```scala
se.scala:5: error: method clone in class Object cannot be accessed in test.WithClone
 Access to protected method clone not permitted because
 prefix type test.WithClone does not conform to
 class Foo where the access take place
   x.clone() 
     ^
one error found
```
In Scala concrete members always override abstract members.

```scala
scala> class Derived { def clone: AnyRef }
<console>:7: error: overriding method clone in class Derived of type ()AnyRef;
 method clone in class Object of type ()Object has weaker access privileges; it should be public;
 (Note that method clone in class Derived of type ()AnyRef is abstract,
  and is therefore overridden by concrete method clone in class Object of type ()Object)
       class Derived { def clone: AnyRef }
             ^
```

Here's a quick attempt to use Java rules for Java defined methods:

I still need to exercise it with some more tests and run it past Martin.
