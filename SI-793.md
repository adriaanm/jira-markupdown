For the new eclipse plugin, the content assist fails to account for the following situation:

{code}
    val arr = Array("Daniel", "Chris", "Joseph")
    arr CTRL+SPACE
{code}

Content assist should display a list of members of the Array class (as it does when the dot (.) access syntax is used).  Note that this space syntax should force content assist invocation using Ctrl+Space, rather than automatically popping up the completion list (as is done with the dot (.) syntax) because it is conceivable that someone could type "arr " without intending to access a member on the instance.
