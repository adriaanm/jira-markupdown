The following snippet should produce a warning that CC(_, B2) isn't matched.

{code:scala}
  sealed abstract class TA
  sealed abstract class TB extends TA
  case object B extends TB
  case object B2 extends TB

  case class CC(i: Int, tb: TB)

  // Should warn that CC(_, B2) isn't matched
  val test: CC => Unit = {
    case CC(_, B) => ()
  }
{code}
No exhaustiveness error is expected here unless you mark the case class {{CC}} as final.

However, even with that change to the test case, the warning is not emitted. I have a patch in https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/2.12.x...retronym:ticket/9630?expand=1 that fixes that problem, I'll add that to the list of patmat improvements that I'll discuss with [~moors] next week.
If the type of the scrutinee is not (effectively) sealed, exhaustiveness warnings aren't issued.

{code}
scala> def foo(a: AnyRef) = a match { case _: String => }
foo: (a: AnyRef)Unit
{code}

The code that deems this "uncheckable" for exhaustivity is: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.6/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/patmat/MatchAnalysis.scala#L203-L213

I have a feeling that we might have carried this restricted checking across from the 2.9 era pattern matcher. I say this after comparing the analysis of a related match from 2.9 and 2.10:

{code}
scala> def foo(a: AnyRef) = Option(a) match { case Some(_: String) => case None => }; scala.util.Properties.releaseVersion
foo: (a: AnyRef)Unit
res10: Option[String] = Some(2.9.2)
{code}

{code}
scala> def foo(a: AnyRef) = Option(a) match { case Some(_: String) => case None => }; scala.util.Properties.releaseVersion
<console>:7: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: Some((x: AnyRef forSome x not in String))
              def foo(a: AnyRef) = Option(a) match { case Some(_: String) => case None => };;
                                         ^
foo: (a: AnyRef)Unit
res0: Option[String] = Some(2.10.4)
{code}

So given that the new pattern matcher has the ability to articulate the counter examples, we might be able to turn on the analysis for all matches.

I will try to lift this restriction and see how the newly issued warnings distribute between useful and spurious.

A related change would be to approximate guards and extractors as always-false for the purposes of exhaustivity (currently they disable exhaustivity).

The scrutinee is a CC and the pattern match is a CC. That ought to make it equivalent to a match on the case fields, which does warn. CC should be considered effectively sealed here even with no modifiers! It's a one element ADT.
{code}
  val test2: (Int, TB) => Unit = {
    case (_, B) => ()
  }
  // a.scala:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
  // It would fail on the following input: (_, B2)
  //   val test2: (Int, TB) => Unit = {
  //                                  ^
  // one warning found
{code}
Stricter warning: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/e5e93ddd6d75b0e4e3955178ff73336676058460

... and the changes to the standard library to address the warnings: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/4954adca6e8cf367f265c644625739725176b02f

Turning exhaustiveness warning on in general is pretty noisy. Perhaps it could be made available with a {{-Xstrict-patmat-analysis}}.

So I agree with you: treating case classes as one element ADTs seems like a useful improvement.
