The line x(set); causes the stack overflow error. I imagine the implicits are too blame. Obviously this is bad code; I was just playing around.

```scala

object test {
  sealed trait HMap {
    def +[T](v: T) = HSome(v,this)
  }

  final case class HSome[T, L <: HMap](head: T, tail: L) extends HMap

  final object HEmpty extends HMap

  val set = HEmpty + 3 + "3"
  implicit def select[T](t: HSome[T,_]) = t.head
  implicit def selectTail[L](t: HSome[_,L]) = t.tail
  
  def foo(x: Int) = 3
  foo(set)
}

```
