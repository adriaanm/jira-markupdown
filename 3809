It may be prudent to include:
```scala
val h = null : A[_]
val i : B[AnyRef] = h
```
into the test case, since implicit conversions "f" and "g" currently work as expected on variable assignment. If fixing overloaded methods will somehow mess up variable assignment, you will not know without the aforementioned lines.
