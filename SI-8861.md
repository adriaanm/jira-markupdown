spurious warning comes with following code

{code}
import akka.actor.Actor

/**
 * Created by tim on 23/09/14.
 */
class TestPF extends Actor {

  val x: Receive = {
    case "hi" => sender ! "hello"
  }

  val y: Receive = {
    case "bye" => sender ! "farewell"
  }

  def receive =   { x orElse y }

  def anotherReceive =   { x orElse y }

  def variant2 : Receive =   { x orElse y }

  def variant3: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = x orElse y

}
{code}

It gives rise to the following warning message

{code}
Warning:(22, 41) a type was inferred to be `Any`; this may indicate a programming error.
  def variant2 : Receive =   { x orElse y }
                                        ^
{code}

for all versions except variant3

Since Receive is defined to be 

{code}
PartialFunction[Any, Unit]
{code}

this seems spurious.

sbt compiler options:

{code}
scalacOptions := Seq("-feature" , "-deprecation" , "-encoding", "utf8" , "-Xlint")
{code}
