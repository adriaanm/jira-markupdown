The constructor with the PrintWriter should be auxiliary as this more limiting.

I consider the current situation as a defect, as to programmatically get the line number of errors (as needed e.g. implementing javax.script api) one has to excessively duplicate code from the Interpreter class. A fix of the issue seems trivial.
(In r24143) Making the interpreter more functional.  Changed the reporter
from an object to a lazy val so it can be overridden in subclasses.
Closes #3513, no review.
