It's possible to construct a case class constant with unexpected null fields, with no compiler warning on 2.10.4. There is a "Reference to uninitialized value X" warning on 2.11.1, but the code still compiles and results in runtime NPEs when the null value is accessed.

Here is a gist with a minimal case to reproduce the bug: https://gist.github.com/ivmaykov/a94c81566f77d66fa82b 
That's the use case for -Xfatal-warnings.

If cars had -Xfatal-warnings, maybe people wouldn't run red lights and drive until they're out of gas.

(Full disclosure: I ran out of gas recently, but the warning light never came on, thanks GMC.)
