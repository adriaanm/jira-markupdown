Here's the test case without a dependency on Scalatest:

{code}
object Test extends App {
 
  trait FormTrait {
    import scala.reflect.runtime.{ universe => ru }

    val runtimeMirror = ru.runtimeMirror(this.getClass.getClassLoader)
    val instanceMirror = runtimeMirror.reflect(this)
    val members = instanceMirror.symbol.typeSignature.members
    def fields = members.filter(_.typeSignature <:< ru.typeOf[Int])
  }
 
  val f = () => {
 
    class Form1 extends FormTrait {
      val f1 = 5
    }
    val form1 = new Form1
 
    println(form1.fields)
 
    val form2 = new FormTrait {
      val g1 = new Form1
    }
 
    form2.g1 // comment this line in order to make the test pass
    ()
  }

  f()  
}
{code}

I haven't minimized it further, but note that the "remove this line and it passes" comment is accurate, and that this is single threaded.

This doesn't crash in 2.11.0-M6, but only because `NoSymbol#owner` no longer throws an exception after fde88c7, "No longer crash on NoSymbol.owner.".
