See contrib 693 (links to the contrib pages are no longer working) / aladdin bug 1218 http://www.scala-lang.org/sites/default/files/aladdin/displayItem.do%3Fid=1218.html

Lex fixed this bug two years ago, but it is back, e.g. in 2.8 nightly builds.

Noting for the moment that the last release where it worked is 2.7.2, so it's not a recent regression:
{code}
[paulp@leaf aladdin1218 (master)]$$ scala272 a.scala 
Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.ArithmeticException
	at Main$$$$anon$$2$$Test$$Abstract.apply((virtual file):13)
	at Main$$$$anon$$2$$Test$$MyThread.run((virtual file):30)
[paulp@leaf aladdin1218 (master)]$$ scala273 a.scala 
Exception in thread "Thread-1" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Main$$$$anon$$2$$Test$$Abstract$$$$anon$$1
	at Main$$$$anon$$2$$Test$$MyHolder.<init>((virtual file):23)
	at Main$$$$anon$$2$$Test$$MyThread.run((virtual file):30)
{code}
On the aladdin page lex says "A better solution would be to compile and run from in-memory byte arrays, thus avoiding this cleanup entirely" but strangely enough (if I'm remembering the timing right) this regression took place at around the same time he implemented just that.
