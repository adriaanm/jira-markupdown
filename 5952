Sorry, but your response is not at all clear.

You appear to be saying that you think the recommended here [https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/Scaladoc/AuthorDocs] style should stay as it is even though it is in conflict with the source of the scala library and in conflict with the scala style guide and Java coding conventions for the last n years.

You appear to be saying that you think it should stay because "it is much easier to get the formatting right", but you don't qualify that with any explanation of why you think it is much easier.  In most cases it is human nature to find the status-quo to be easiest to get right.

You say that the old style was a constant hassle to you, and behaves inconsistently and non-obviously to you, but it is no hassle to me and entirely obvious to me.  So I think you are effectively saying that the new style is your personal preference.

My argument is not about personal preference, it is about maintaining consistency and not changing things that don't have to be changed because changing things wastes unnecessarily time and effort if it does not bring with it some clear benefit.

Your final comment seems to be saying that you are proposing patching the entire Scala library comments to change to the 'new style'.  Why?
