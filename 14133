If I have a JPA entity containing something like
{code}
  @OneToMany{val mappedBy = "user",
	     val cascade = Array(CascadeType.ALL),
	     val fetch = FetchType.LAZY }
  var roles : java.util.List[UserRole] = new java.util.Vector[UserRole]
{code}

eclipselink complains about

{code}
The target entity of the relationship attribute [roles] on the
class [class com.example.User] cannot be determined.  When not
using generics, ensure the target entity is defined on the
relationship mapping.
{code}

I have to change the annotation to
{code}
  @OneToMany{val mappedBy = "user",
	     val cascade = Array(CascadeType.ALL),
	     val targetEntity = classOf[UserRole],
	     val fetch = FetchType.LAZY }
{code}

It seems like the classfile is missing some information about the generic types that should be there.
