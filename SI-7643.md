Eclipse, or rather the presentation compiler in version 2.11.0-20130708-160505, reports an error with the following code:

```
List(1,2) collect {
  case i if i > 5 => i
}
```

type mismatch; found : Int => Int required: PartialFunction[Int,?]

The actual compiler works fine, it's just the IDE that reports the error.
I just flipped the bit to fix this bug, but also to see what else is going to break:
