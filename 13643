Annotations on trait methods (probably everything else as well) are lost when using an already compiled trait.

Consider two files:
```scala
trait Foo {
  @throws(classOf[Exception])
  def moo {
    println("moo")
  }
}
```

and
```scala
class Foo2 extends Foo
```

When compiled together, Foo2 looks correct after mixin:
```scala
  class Foo2 extends java.lang.Object with Foo with ScalaObject {
    @throws(classOf[java.lang.Exception]) def moo(): Unit = Foo$$class.moo(Foo2.this);
...
```

When compiling only `Foo2`:
```scala
 class Foo2 extends java.lang.Object with Foo with ScalaObject {
    def moo(): Unit = Foo$$class.moo(Foo2.this);
...
```

This might be related to the latest changes to annotations. It is the same reason why `ScalaObject.$$tag` is not marked as `@remote` when compiling user code.
