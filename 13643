Annotations on trait methods (probably everything else as well) are lost when using an already compiled trait.

Consider two files:

{code}
trait Foo {
  @throws(classOf[Exception])
  def moo {
    println("moo")
  }
}
{code}

and

{code}
class Foo2 extends Foo
{code}

When compiled together, Foo2 looks correct after mixin:

{code}
  class Foo2 extends java.lang.Object with Foo with ScalaObject {
    @throws(classOf[java.lang.Exception]) def moo(): Unit = Foo$$class.moo(Foo2.this);
...
{code}

When compiling only `Foo2`:

{code}
 class Foo2 extends java.lang.Object with Foo with ScalaObject {
    def moo(): Unit = Foo$$class.moo(Foo2.this);
...
{code}

This might be related to the latest changes to annotations. It is the same reason why `ScalaObject.$$tag` is not marked as `@remote` when compiling user code.
