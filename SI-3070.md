Please add support for generic types in the Scala -> JDT mapping so that the parameter type information is available in instances of IType, IMethod, etc.  This will facilitate the generation of abstract types and methods when creating a new class, trait, or object element which is to be a subtype of other elements with abstract members.
See #3188 for a defect which is caused by this missing functionality.
