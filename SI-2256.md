I changed: 

```scala
@OneToMany{val mappedBy="parentObject", val targetEntity=classOf[ChildObject]} 
var models: Set[ChildObject] = new HashSet[ChildObject] 
```

Here we are using java.util.Set and java.util.HashSet to keep a list of child objects against a parent object. 

I updated the annotation to work with 2.8.0: 

```scala
@OneToMany(mappedBy="parentObject", targetEntity=classOf[ChildObject]) 
var models: Set[ChildObject] = new HashSet[ChildObject] 
```

In addition I am using 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT in my pom.xml.

Now I am getting the following Hibernate error: 

```scala
Caused by: org.hibernate.MappingException: Could not determine type for: java.util.Set, at table: PARENT_OBJECT, for columns: [org.hibernate.mapping.Column(models)] 
        at org.hibernate.mapping.SimpleValue.getType(SimpleValue.java:269)

        at org.hibernate.cfg.AnnotationConfiguration.buildSessionFactory(AnnotationConfiguration.java:859) 
```
To make sure I understand correctly (please confirm). Are you saying that:

```scala
class C {
  @ann val x = [..]
  
  def getX() = x
}
```

In 2.7.5, the annotation `@ann` is added to the `getX` method. In 2.8.0 this is not the case, there it only happens when using `@BeanProperty` instead of manually adding the bean getter.


Note that this behavior is likely to change so that by default none of the synthetic getters/setters will have the annotations of the field, see http://www.nabble.com/-scala--field-annotations%2C-getters-setters-and-BeanProperty-td24970781.html

Hi.

To confirm in 2.7.5:

```scala
class C {
  @ann val x = [..]

  def getX = x
}
```

works fine, but in 2.8.0 one of the following two solutions must be used:

```scala
class C {
  val x = [..]

  @ann
  def getX = x
}
```

or

```scala
class C {
  @ann
  @BeanProperty val x = [..]
}
```

This is when using JPA and hibernate.
