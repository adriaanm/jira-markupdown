These are becoming ever hairier problems. It looks like the original approach of simply providing a Java->Scala parser has limitations. There seem to be lots of places where later phases of the compiler have to be adapted. That's a lot of work, and I won't be able to do it. So I think we have to put this effort on hold until we find a volunteer to do this.
