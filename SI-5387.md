scala.collection.TraversableLike:

{code:|borderStyle=solid}
def dropWhile(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val b = newBuilder
  var go = false
  for (x <- this) {
    if (!p(x)) go = true
    if (go) b += x
  }
  b.result
}
```scala


If the predicate {{p}} is an expensive computation than it unnecessarily slows {{dropWhile}} down after {{go}} is {{true}}.

Suggestion:

{code:|borderStyle=solid}
def dropWhile(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val b = newBuilder
  var go = false
  for (x <- this) {
    if (go) b += x
    else { if (!p(x)) go = true }
  }
  b.result
}
```
The suggested fix is broken. It always drops the first element, as go is always false in the first iteration. The following should implement the request correctly (notice the added !go && ):

```scala
def dropWhile(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
  val b = newBuilder
  var go = false
  for (x <- this) {
    if (!go && !p(x)) go = true
    if (go) b += x
  }
  b.result
}
```

Notice that this changes the semantics with regard to side effects of predicate p.
Right, your suggestion was my first attempt. **Tryed** to improved, but failed obviously.
