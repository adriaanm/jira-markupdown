**Problem**:
When making a clean distribution build of scala-library on a windows system, the build target will fail at line 39.  The error is:
  BUILD FAILED
  C:\eclipse3.4\workspaceScala\scala-library\build.xml:39:   C:\eclipse3.4\workspaceScala\scala\dists\latest\src not found.

The build script at this point is trying to copy a series of jar files from the scala project to the scala-library project.  Here is the relevant snippet from scala-library\build.xml:
```scala
		<copy todir="lib">
      <fileset dir="${scala.origin}/lib">
        <include name="scala-library.jar"/>
        <include name="scala-dbc.jar"/>
        <include name="scala-swing.jar"/>
      </fileset>
      <fileset dir="${scala.origin}/src">
        <include name="scala-library-src.jar"/>
        <include name="scala-dbc-src.jar"/>
        <include name="scala-swing-src.jar"/>
      </fileset>
```

The root problem is actually in the scala/build.xml.  The dist.latest.win task copies the distribution you have just built to a /scala/dists/latest directory.  Unfortunately dist.latest.win is called before the dist.src is run.  

On Unix systems this is no problem since a symbolic link is used to point to the latest build directory.  On windows systems the latest build is copied to a new "latest" directory before all the components have been created.  

**Fix**:
Change the dist task call sequence.

(Old)   dist.done<--dist.src<--dist.man<--dist.doc<--dist.latest<--(dist.latest.unix,dist.latest.win)<--dist.base<--dist.start

(New) dist.done<--dist.latest<--(dist.latest.unix,dist.latest.win)<--dist.src<--dist.man<--dist.doc<--dist.base<--dist.start
