This works:
  class Cow(mylist : List[String])
  val makeCow = new Cow(_)
  
But this doesn't:
  class Chicken[T] (mylist : List[T])
  val makeChicken = new Chicken(_)

I get a compile error: 'missing type for expanded function'. It'd be nice if the compiler could infer the types in this situation. Thanks!
