The fact that the field has never been populated is a pretty compelling argument that it is not useful for java interop - it could never have helped anyone achieve any interesting form of interop unless they only use their fields to store 0, false, and null, or the form of interop being pursued is for "people who only check if the field exists, but never read it", which seems unlikely.

On the strength of that evidence, how about we just don't generate the field, as previously suggested and elaborated upon in scala/bug#4605.
