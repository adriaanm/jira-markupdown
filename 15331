I have a trait for a type-level function:

{code}
trait TFn1[I, O] {
  type app[i <: I] <: O
}
{code}

and I'm trying to write bind/flatMap for it.  The following is a simplified example that gives me the error I'm getting:
{code}
trait TFn1B[T] {
  type x[a, b, f <: TFn1[a, TFn1[T, b]] ] =
    TFn1[T, b] {
      type app[s <: T] = f#app[a]#app[s]
    }
}
{code}

The error is:
{code}
type arguments [s] do not conform to type app's type parameter bounds [i <: I]
           TFn1[T, b] {
           ^
{code}
I think the error message is for the `app[s]` part despite where `^` points.  It looks like scalac doesn't know that:
{code}
  f#app[a] <: TFn1[T, b]
{code}
which should mean that `s <: I` since `I is T and s <: T`.

It seems to me that the code should be accepted but maybe some type information gets lost with the second projection. 

This is in 2.8.0.RC2.  As Eric Willigers pointed out on the mailing list, this code is accepted in 2.7.x
