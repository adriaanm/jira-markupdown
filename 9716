Scala didn't hit 16k inquiries on StackOverflow because it has no rough edges.

Scala is a smooth operator five days a week; on weekends, it should get edgy.

Just normalizing this feature will cut my SO rating by about half.  I think the other half is overload resolution.  After wasting time recently on another overload question, I was kind of hoping you'd solve signature selection with annotations first.  Overloading is so annoying that people keep asking the same questions and picking the wrong answers!  To paraphrase paulp on this score, "This question is to the wrong answer."

OK, that's not as funny as the t-shirt I'm wearing right now with the original paulpism, "These answers are all to the wrong question."

By the way, what is the symbol for the "smooth operator"?
