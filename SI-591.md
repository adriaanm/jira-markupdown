I get the following results:

scala> def implicitly[T](implicit t : T) = t
implicitly: [T](implicit T)T

scala> implicit def perhaps[T](implicit t : T) : Option[T] = Some(t);
perhaps: [T](implicit T)Option[T]

scala> implicit val hello = "Hello"
hello: java.lang.String = Hello

scala> implicitly[String]
res0: String = Hello

implicitly[Option[String]]
<console>:8: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Option[String]
was found.
       implicitly[Option[String]]
       ^

But implicitly[Option[String]] should get the implicit parameter perhaps(hello) passed.

This may be related to ticket SI-298. 
Seems like the spec doesn't allow this (7.2):

{code}
The actual arguments that are eligible to be passed to an implicit parameter of type
T fall into two categories. First, eligible are all identifiers x that can be accessed at
the point of the method call without a prefix and that denote an implicit definition
(�7.1) or an implicit parameter. An eligible identifier may thus be a local name, or a
member of an enclosing template, or it may be have been made accessiblewithout a
prefix through an import clause (�4.7). Second, eligible are also all implicit members
of some object that belongs to the implicit scope of the implicit parameter’s
type, T .
{code}
Your example would fall into the first category if at all, but the section only talks about identifiers and not function results as candidates for implicit parameters. Anyways, leaving for Martin to decide.

On a side note: better wrap code blocks in 
{code}
{{...}}
{code}

Thanks.

My interpretation based on the somewhat difficult to parse spec and the current behaviour is that if I can refer to something by an identifier then it should be eligibile to be passed as an implicit argument.

The problem here actually seems to be somewhat different. It appears that while we have:

{code}
scala> perhaps[String]
res0: Option[String] = Some(Hello)
{code}

The type parameter is incorrectly picked up when we assign a type to the overall expression:

{code}
scala> (perhaps : Option[String])
<console>:7: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Nothing was fou
nd.
       (perhaps : Option[String])
        ^
{code}

So I think this is probably the source of the problem, not the actual implicits mechanism?

Incidentally, I tried to see what would happen if I attempted this with 

{code}
implicit val foo : Nothing = null;
{code}

And blew up the compiler again, in more or less the same manner as SI-590. I'll attach a comment about that there.
Ok. This is very specifically a problem with covariant types. See the following example:

{code}
scala> def implicitly[T](implicit t : T) = t 
implicitly: [T](implicit T)T

scala> class Foo[T](val t : T);
defined class Foo

scala> implicit def foo[T](implicit t : T) = new Foo[T](t)
foo: [T](implicit T)Foo[T]

scala> implicit val hello = "Hello"
hello: java.lang.String = Hello

scala> implicitly[String]
res0: String = Hello

scala> implicitly[Foo[String]] 
res1: Foo[String] = Foo@11b92ef

scala> class Bar[+T](val t : T);                          
defined class Bar

scala> implicit def bar[T](implicit t : T) = new Bar[T](t)    
bar: [T](implicit T)Bar[T]

scala> implicitly[Bar[String]]
<console>:10: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Bar[String] was found.
       implicitly[Bar[String]]
       ^

{code}
