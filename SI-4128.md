protected secondary constructors have general code access.
{code}
object O {
   class Foo(name: String) {
      protected def this() = this("")
      protected def length = name.length
   }

   val foo = new Foo()   // should NOT compile (but does)
   val len = foo.length  // DOES NOT compile
}

{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Protected def this should not be accessible by general code.
The compiler ought to flag an error.



=== What do you see instead? ===
Punt

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:2.9.0.r23885-b20110103142535
  - Java:1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Linux
Not just secondary constructors by any means.  All three of these compile in trunk.
{code}
package bip {
  class Foo() {
    protected def this(name: String) = this()
  }

  class Foo2 protected (name: String) { }

  protected class Foo3(name: String) { }
}

package bop {
  import bip._

  object P {
    val foo = new Foo("abc")
    val foo2 = new Foo2("abc")
    val foo3 = new Foo3("abc")
  }
}
{code}
In 2.7.7, that's three errors.
{code}
bip.scala:15: error: wrong number of arguments for constructor Foo: ()bip.Foo
    val foo = new Foo("abc")
              ^
bip.scala:16: error: constructor Foo2 cannot be accessed in object P
    val foo2 = new Foo2("abc")
               ^
bip.scala:17: error: class Foo3 cannot be accessed in package bip
    val foo3 = new Foo3("abc")
                   ^
three errors found  
{code}
In 2.8.0 and 2.8.1, one error.
{code}
bip.scala:17: error: class Foo3 cannot be accessed in package bip
    val foo3 = new Foo3("abc")
                   ^
one error found  
{code}

(In r23891) Protected protected constructors.  They have been essentially public
since r19547, which was for SI-1836 but loosened the noose too much.
Closes SI-4128, review by odersky.
