Stumbled across this bug just minutes after starting to play with 2.10.0-RC2:
{noformat}
scala> val x = "x"
x: String = x

scala> raw"\n$x\n"
res1: String = 
"\nx
"
{noformat}


It seems like there is a patch already committed (0b7aaa5 by Julien Richard-Foy), which is on the master branch, but not in 2.10.0-RC2.
