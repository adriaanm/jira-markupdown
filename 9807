Yes, they have brittle semantics.  Really brittle: 
```scala
Map(1 -> "fish", 2 -> "dish").withDefaultValue("wish").filterKeys(_ > 1).apply(3)
```

does not return "wish".  Anyway, it can't sensibly be fixed by returning Map$WithDefault; you have to rework the hierarchy.  An enhancement request is fine, but I don't see this going in before 3.0.  If you need there to be a default, you have to insist on it with your own wrapper.
