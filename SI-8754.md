LinearSeqLike:
```scala
 *  Linear sequences are defined in terms of three abstract methods, which are assumed
 *  to have efficient implementations. These are:
 *  {{{
 *     def isEmpty: Boolean
 *     def head: A
 *     def tail: Repr
 *  }}}
```

Nope.

```scala
scala> class Foo extends scala.collection.LinearSeqLike[Int, Foo]
<console>:7: error: class Foo needs to be abstract, since:
it has 4 unimplemented members.
/** As seen from class Foo, the missing signatures are as follows.
 *  For convenience, these are usable as stub implementations.
 */
  // Members declared in scala.collection.LinearSeqLike
  def seq: scala.collection.LinearSeq[Int] = ???

  // Members declared in scala.collection.SeqLike
  def apply(idx: Int): Int = ???
  def length: Int = ???

  // Members declared in scala.collection.TraversableLike
  protected[this] def newBuilder: scala.collection.mutable.Builder[Int,Foo] = ???

       class Foo extends scala.collection.LinearSeqLike[Int, Foo]
             ^
```
@paulp It's a documentation error in that what is abstract and what is not doesn't match up with how things are actually delivered.  They *do* override various methods to use head etc., but the documentation needs to spell out that it is your job to implement those efficiently AND then use those to implement the abstract methods.

If you mean "why is there even an LinearSeq and LinearSeqOptimized", well, yeah.  Needs to be some redesign.  "LinearSeq" doesn't sound to me like "please use head and tail for Iterator but not anything else".

However, given that this is what LinearSeq has come to mean, for good or (more likely) for ill, at least the docs should clearly spell that out.
