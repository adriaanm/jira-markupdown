the following has an exhaustiveness warning in 2.10.1 but not in 2.10.0:

```scala
sealed trait Bool
object Bool {
  case object FALSE extends Bool
  case object TRUE extends Bool

  def show(b: Bool) = b match {
    case FALSE => "1"
    case TRUE  => "2"
  }
}
```

but this is ok:

```scala
sealed trait Bool
case object FALSE extends Bool
case object TRUE extends Bool

object Bool {
  def show(b: Bool) = b match {
    case FALSE => "1"
    case TRUE  => "2"
  }
}
```

warning is:

```
[info] Compiling 2 Scala sources to /Volumes/src/test/target/scala-2.10/classes...
[warn] /Volumes/src/test/src/main/scala/Bool.scala:6: match may not be exhaustive.
[warn] It would fail on the following inputs: FALSE, TRUE
[warn]   def show(b: Bool) = b match {
[warn]                       ^
[warn] one warning found
```

Note that if I change the inner case objects to case classes the warning remains.
I found and fixed this a few days ago as #7285.

The workaround is to qualify the references to FALSE/TRUE. Also note that the bug doesn't occur for matches defined outside of `Bool`

```scala
sealed trait Bool
object Bool {
  case object FALSE extends Bool
  case object TRUE extends Bool

  def show(b: Bool) = b match {
    case Bool.FALSE => "1"
    case Bool.TRUE  => "2"
  }
}

object Test {
  import Bool._
  def show(b: Bool) = b match {
    case FALSE => "1"
    case TRUE  => "2"
  }
}
```
