This is presumably a result of the fix for scala/bug#1360, which calls .toArray on everything so you can pass other kinds of seqs to java without a runtime exception.  At the language level calling .toArray on an array does return the same array, so I thought this was doing the right thing; but probably something about the patch is sidestepping that.
