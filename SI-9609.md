The `-d` option allows an output directory to be selected for filing generated documentation under yet this is not effectively documented in the CLI help.

It's hidden in the `scalac` section and does not mentioned generated documents.

```scala
$ "C:\Program Files (x86)\scala\bin\scaladoc" -help
Usage: scaladoc <options> <source files>
where possible scaladoc options include:
  -author                                     Include authors.
  -diagrams                                   Create inheritance diagrams for classes, traits and packages.
  -diagrams-dot-path <path>                   The path to the dot executable used to generate the inheritance diagrams. Eg: /usr/bin/dot
  -diagrams-dot-restart <n>                   The number of times to restart a malfunctioning dot process before disabling diagrams (default: 5)
  -diagrams-dot-timeout <n>                   The timeout before the graphviz dot util is forcefully closed, in seconds (default: 10)
  -diagrams-max-classes <n>                   The maximum number of superclasses or subclasses to show in a diagram
  -diagrams-max-implicits <n>                 The maximum number of implicitly converted classes to show in a diagram
  -doc-footer <footer>                        A footer on every ScalaDoc page, by default the EPFL/Typesafe copyright notice. Can be overridden with a custom footer.
  -doc-format:<format>                        Selects in which format documentation is rendered (html) default:html
  -doc-generator <class-name>                 The fully qualified name of a doclet class, which will be used to generate the documentation
  -doc-no-compile <path>                      A directory containing sources which should be parsed, no more (e.g. AnyRef.scala)
  -doc-root-content <path>                    The file from which the root package documentation should be imported.
  -doc-source-url <url>                       A URL pattern used to link to the source file; the following variables are available: ▒{TPL_NAME}, ▒{TPL_OWNER} and respectively ▒{FILE_PATH}. For example, for `scala.collection.Seq`, the variables will be expanded to `Seq`, `scala.collection` and respectively `scala/collection/Seq` (without the backquotes). To obtain a relative path for ▒{FILE_PATH} instead of an absolute one, use the -sourcepath setting.
  -doc-title <title>                          The overall name of the Scaladoc site
  -doc-version <version>                      An optional version number, to be appended to the title
  -expand-all-types                           Expand all type aliases and abstract types into full template pages. (locally this can be done with the @template annotation)
  -groups                                     Group similar functions together (based on the @group annotation)
  -implicits                                  Document members inherited by implicit conversions.
  -implicits-hide:<implicit(s)>               Hide the members inherited by the given comma separated, fully qualified implicit conversions. Add dot (.) to include default conversions.
  -implicits-show-all                         Show members inherited by implicit conversions that are impossible in the default scope. (for example conversions that require Numeric[String] to be in scope)
  -no-link-warnings                           Avoid warnings for ambiguous and incorrect links.
  -no-prefixes                                Prevents generating prefixes in types, possibly creating ambiguous references, but significantly speeding up scaladoc.
  -raw-output                                 For each html file, create another .html.raw file containing only the text. (can be used for quickly diffing two scaladoc outputs)
  -skip-packages <<package1>:...:<packageN>>  A colon-delimited list of fully qualified package names that will be skipped from scaladoc.

Additional debug settings:
  -diagrams-debug                             Show debugging information for the diagram creation process.
  -implicits-debug                            Show debugging information for members inherited by implicit conversions.

```
Maybe the description for `-d` can be amended to say that it just sets where the output goes (regardless of what kind of output), which is exactly what it does. It sort of makes sense for it to be in the scalac section since it is just a standard scalac option like the others.
