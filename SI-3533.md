Provide such a java class:

public class SuperA{
   public void funcN(Object ... args) {
      for (Object obj: args)  System.out.println(obj);
   }
}

Now I want to define a sub-class to override the method `funcN`, but I got a compilation error, which said override nothing.

Neither write the code like this: 
  override def funcN(args: Array[Any]) : Unit = { ... }
nor like this
  override def funcN(args :Any * ) : Unit = { ... }
 
will pass , even if I replace the type `Any` with `AnyRef`.

Is it a bug of Scala.2.8.0.RC3 ? Or I am wrong ? Or there are some ways to accomplish the goal .


   

Please don't open tickets about this sort of thing unless you've asked on a mailing list first.
