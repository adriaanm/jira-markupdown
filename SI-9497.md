When implementing my own mutable Set with mutable.SetLike, the clear method does not remove all elements in some cases. It only happens when I have certain strings in my Set, in this case: "EXPOSEDNODE" and "CONNECTABLE".

```java
import collection.mutable

class MySet(self:mutable.Set[String]) extends mutable.Set[String] with mutable.SetLike[String, MySet]{

  override def -=(elem: String) = {self -= elem; this}
  override def +=(elem: String) = {self += elem; this}

  override def empty = new MySet(self.empty)
  override def iterator = self.iterator
  override def contains(elem: String) = self.contains(elem)
}

val s = new MySet(mutable.Set("EXPOSEDNODE", "CONNECTABLE"))
s.clear()
println(s) // prints "Set(CONNECTABLE)"
```
It seems like this is related to:
```java
scala> val s = collection.mutable.Set("EXPOSEDNODE", "CONNECTABLE"); s.foreach(s -=)
s: scala.collection.mutable.Set[String] = Set(CONNECTABLE)
```

As the default implementation of SetLike.clear() is **foreach(-=)** [SetLike.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/0b47dc2f28c997aed86d6f615da00f48913dd46c/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/SetLike.scala#L132)
This bug has the same cause as #7269, but then only `retain()` was fixed. I have just submitted [a pull request](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4810) in which `clear()` is fixed to have the same structure as `retain()`.
