I run:

```scala
scalac -d bin proc.scala commons/*.scala
```

and get a long error message which I've attached. I've also attached all the source files. I'm sorry I don't have time to create a small test case.

However, if I moved the definiton of the three classes Durations, Stats, Accumulator out into the top of object Main, everything's dandy.
I've paired back the example to what fails. The real error is that case classes redefined within a for comprehension cause a crash, if there are 2 of them and they depend on each other.

```scala

object Main {
  def main(args : Array[String]) {
    val xs = for (i <- List(1,2,3)) yield {
      case class Bar()
      case class Foo(b : Bar)
      Foo(Bar())
    }
    println("fail")
  }
}
```
