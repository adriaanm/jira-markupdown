Does this mean that in 2.11.3, scala.collection.concurrent.TrieMap will override the getOrElseMethod method in a properly thread-safe and atomic way?

If the contract is relaxed, I guess that this could be done in scala.collection.concurrent.Map instead, like this:

{code}
override def getOrElseUpdate(key: A, op: => B): B =
  get(key) match {
    case Some(v) => v
    case None => val d = op; putIfAbsent(key, d).getOrElse(d)
  }
{code}
