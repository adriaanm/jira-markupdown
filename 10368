@JasonZaugg I'm confused, why do you think the test doesn't do what it should? Also, if you uncomment [this line](https://github.com/dotta/scala/commit/9c40363a38339e987b092f4bd08b305b64e4d49b#diff-fbe672622018892fa284de6e005504c2R7), the test succeed, which is why I believe the the test is meaningful - but I might be missing something. As far as I can tell, the issue is that the package object needs to be explicitly loaded, otherwise the presentation compiler gets confused. What you say about `openPackageModule` makes sense to me, so indeed my test case may be too specific (compared to the one you provided in your previous comment).
