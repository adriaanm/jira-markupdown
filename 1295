It turns out that actually this has nothing to do with squeezing, it's just that squeezing masked many of the error cases. I've now got a test case that doesn't depend on squeeze being off. It's in test/pending/pos/t1480.scala. 

This seems to be a new bug introduced by some of my changes (it works in 2.7.2). I think it's caused by the changes I made in r16341 to fix ticket scala/bug#1260.
