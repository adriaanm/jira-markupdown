Moved five methods from LinearSeqOptimized to List
{quote}

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2a2d9235

{{List}} ain't the only {{LinearSeqOptimized}} in town: that commit changed the performance and evaluation characteristics of the other subclasses: {{Stream}}, {{Queue}}, {{Stack}}, and {{MutableList}}.

{code}
scala> Stream.continually(()).filterNot(_ => false).take(2)
{code}

I've only highlighted the first example I've found. I really don't see how that change can be allowed -- even if you were to copy/paste the removed methods into those other subclasses, you would have broken any third party code extending this trait. You could take the position that it's just an implementation trait, which would let you remove if from the parents of List.

*Update*: Regressed and now broken again. See https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8627
Jason: actually it turned out that the example you give in this ticket has not been broken by
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2a2d9235

but by

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/df9f470f

The reason is that we no longer delegate to {{filter}} (which Stream overrides) but we provide our own implementation based on {{foreach}}.

I believe that changes to {{LinearSeqOptimized}} are irrelevant for other (non-lazy collections) in a sense that they do not change semantics. Do you agree?

I don't understand why Stream mixes-in {{LinearSeqOptimized}} in the first place but this seems to be (also) irrelevant. In order to fix this bug we need to override {{filterNot}} in Stream the same way as {{filter}} is overriden of revert change to {{TraversableLike}}. I think the later is way to go.

WDYT?
I can't find any bugs other than {{filterNot}}. So fixing that would be sufficient. But this highlights the fragility of sharing code between lazy and strict collections. (Same story for immutable/mutable.)
Ok. I'll go and revert change in {{TraversableLike}}.

I agree on general comment. However, fixing it seems very tricky as it would require some major changes to collection hierarchy.
