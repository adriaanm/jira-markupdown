> What I wanted is that 'operator' would only be applicable to other instantiation of Base class of the *same* type A. 

Achievable with
```scala
  def operatorImpl[B >: A <: A](sf: Base[B])  = {
    sf match {
      case DerivClass1(value) => println("this should work (and it does)")
      case DerivClass2(value) => println("and this does to")
    }
  }
```
