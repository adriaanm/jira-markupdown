I think you are referring to {{collection.mutable.Buffer}}. It would be nice to have an immutable {{Buffer}} as well, but for the mutable one I think the current behaviour is ok. Other collections in {{mutable}}, like {{Map}}, behave similarly. If you'd like to contribute an immutable Buffer, we'd be very happy to include it in the library. ;-)
