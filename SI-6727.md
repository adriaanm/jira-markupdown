The program below is inspired by {{files/pos/z1730.scala}}

{noformat}
class X[R] {

  def xx(value: () => R) = 0

  def goo2  = (new X[Int]).xx(

    {
       def poorMansMH1(): Int = 34

       @SerialVersionUID(0)
       final class AF
       extends scala.runtime.AbstractFunction0[Int]
       with Serializable {
         def apply(): Int = poorMansMH1()
       }

       new AF()
     }

  )

}
{noformat}

The program typechecks but crashes the compiler with {{-Ycheck:all}}

Leaving everthing as above but changing {{def apply() = 34}} (ie the local method "poorMansMH1" isn't invoked anywhere) compiles fine, also under {{-Ycheck:all}}
