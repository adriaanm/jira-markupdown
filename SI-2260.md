This issue is related to changes made under ticket SI-1303 where several default implementations for implicit parameters were created for common objects; however, there is no default support for the Ordered trait or java.lang.Comparable. Below is example code (modeled after a 2.7.5 to 2.8.0 "regression" found in the sbaz code base):

File name: src/bug.scala
{code}
package top

class Text(val value: String) extends Ordered[Text] {
  def compare(that: Text) = value.compare(that.value)
}

object Index {
  import scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap
  val tree = TreeMap.empty[Text, String]
}
{code}

Compiling this yields the following error with 2.8.0:
{code}
src/bug.scala:9: error: could not find implicit value for parameter ord:Ordering[top.Text].
  val tree = TreeMap.empty[Text, String]
{code}

The function you need is present in Ordering, it's just not marked implicit:
{code}
  def ordered[A <: Ordered[A]] : Ordering[A] = new Ordering[A] {
    def compare(x : A, y : A) = x.compare(y);
  }
{code}
However I can't just mark it implicit because this breaks the coexistence of Ordering and Ordered by creating ambiguities with all the other implicits in Ordering.  As yet I don't have an idea how to address this.

For the moment you can create and pass it explicitly:
{code}
val tree = TreeMap.empty[Text, String](Ordering.ordered[Text])
{code}
