Objects and lazy vals defined inside of a method are not thread-safe. Consider the following code:

```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    object Singleton {
      val field = ()
      println("Initializing singleton from: " + Thread.currentThread.getName)
    }

    var i = 0
    while (i < 4) {
      new Thread(new Runnable {
        def run = Singleton.field
      }).start
      i += 1
    }
  }
}
```

I would expect the Singleton object to be initialized once, from one thread. However, running the code produces:

```scala
Initializing singleton from: Thread-3
Initializing singleton from: Thread-2
Initializing singleton from: Thread-1
Initializing singleton from: Thread-0
```

The same result is observed if instead of `object Singleton { ... } ` I define `class Singleton { ... }; lazy val Singleton = new Singleton`.

If the definition of `Singleton` (either object or lazy val) is pulled out of the `main` method (that is, put in the body of the `Main` class or in the top-level) then the code behaves correctly.

This was verified on both 2.7.7 and 2.8.0.Beta1.
In the broad sense this a duplicate of #1591, though it looks worse in this report.  It's an issue.  I'm very aware of it and also very unable to tackle it anytime soon.  I don't know if it's on anyone else's radar.
This is directly related to #2424 (Volatile annotation should yield volatile semantics on a local var captured by closures). We should reconsider the resolution of that one, and implement the required logic for volatile ref cells.

That alone is not enough (not sure if you wanted to imply that). It seems that synchronization (double-checked locking) is completely missing for lazy vals defined inside of methods.
Here's a workaround for the `lazy val` case: make sure lazy vals are defined in a nested class instead of directly in the method. This makes sure that the normal synchronization mechanism is applied. Perhaps that could be a guide for the solution for the `lazy val` case: make sure that the synchronization stuff is generated for lazy vals nested in methods as well (`mkLazyDef` in the Mixin-phase seems to apply only to direct members of classes/traits/objects). 

For the `object` case, even wrapping doesn't work. If the object instance would just be another lazy val, the solution for the lazy val case would solve the object's problem probably, as well. This is probably a bigger change, but perhaps in the long run?

```scala
object Test {
  val i = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger(1)
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val waitTime = Integer.parseInt(args(0))
    val waitTime2 = Integer.parseInt(args(1))
    class Inner {
      lazy val Murks = {
      // or: object Murks {
        println(i.getAndIncrement+") Initializing "+Thread.currentThread)
        Thread.sleep(waitTime)
        "test"
      }
      for (i <- 0 to 20) { 
        new Thread(new Runnable { 
          def run:Unit = println(Murks+": "+Thread.currentThread)
        }).start()
        Thread.sleep(waitTime2) 
      }
    }
    new Inner()
  }
}
```

That is not enough, but that's the blocker. Adding double checked locking is trivial, while the volatile semantics for ref cells was a bit more work (fixed yesterday by Martin). We'll fix it for 2.8.
(In r22206) Make local lazy values thread-safe. A local lazy val (defined inside a method) 
is now guaranteed to be initialized at most once, even when accessed from different
threads. Closes #3007, review by odersky.
