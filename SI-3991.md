Today I can scope visibility of a data member to a package:


{code}
protected[mypkg] var foo:String
{code}


It would be great if I could do something like this:


{code}
protected_write[mypkg] var foo:String
{code}


This would permit change access in package mypkg but read-only access everywhere else.

A non-parameterized version could work similarly for inheritance:


{code}
protected_write var foo:String
{code}


This would allow children to read but only the declaring class to change the value.

Of course you can do the same thing with accessors but this would be more concise.
