I have defined a constant in a Java interface and in the same package I have defined a Scala class that attempts to use that constant in an annotation (like I normally do in Java where this works fine). 

Unfortunately, I get a compiler error about attribute needs to be a constant which is a bit crazy. Works if I supply the value as a quoted string but then I would have to copy-paste the namespace into all my scala files which is not very good.

See example below: 

{code}
package com.test.ws;

// Java file with interface with constants:
public interface WebServiceConstants
{
	public static final String WEBSERVICE_NS = "http://www.test.com/";
}

// Scala file:
package com.test.ws;

import javax.xml.bind.annotation._

@XmlRootElement{val namespace=WebServiceConstants.WEBSERVICE_NS}
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
class WebServiceModuleInstance {
	
}
{code}

P.S. Tested with Java 1.6 on Mac using the compiler in the eclipse plugin for 2.7.5
