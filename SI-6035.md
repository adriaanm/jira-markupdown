Let's say we compile code like this:
{code:title=check-both.scala}
trait Foo[@specialized(Int) A] {
  def foo(x: A): A
}
abstract class Inter extends Foo[Int]
class Baz extends Inter {
  def foo(x: Int) = x + 1
}
```scala

./bin/scalac -d classes/ check-both.scala
and we'll inspect methods in Baz:

{code:title=javap classes/Baz}
Compiled from "check-both.scala"
public class Baz extends Inter{
    public int foo(int);
    public int foo$mcI$sp(int);
    public java.lang.Object foo(java.lang.Object);
    public Baz();
}
```

Now let's compile the same code in two steps:

{code:title=check.scala}
trait Foo[@specialized(Int) A] {  
  def foo(x: A): A
}

abstract class Inter extends Foo[Int]
```scala

using ./bin/scalac -d classes/ check.scala
and then:

```
class Baz extends Inter {
  def foo(x: Int) = x + 1
}
```scala

using ./bin/scalac -cp classes/ -d classes/ check2.scala
if we then inspect byte of Baz we'll see:
```
Compiled from "check2.scala"
public class Baz extends Inter{
    public int foo(int);
    public java.lang.Object foo(java.lang.Object);
    public Baz();
}
{code}

Notice the difference that there's no public int foo$mcI$sp(int); generated this time. The reason for that is that we do not pickle SPECIALIZED flag that is set on type parameter symbols. Thus, if we read bytecode for Inter and Foo we'll not have SPECIALIZED flag set for parameter A and this will cause specialization to not kick in.

Now, the reason why we do not pickle SPECIALIZED flag is twofold:
1. SPECIALIZED flag is set uncurry (see: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/UnCurry.scala#L569). This is rather questionable place for that kind of code as it mutates flags and pickle will never see those changes.
2. Even if we set the flag before symbols pickling this won't help because
only 32 lowest bits are pickled (see https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Flags.scala#L310) and SPECIALIZED has index 40 (https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Flags.scala#L160).

The first problem has been introduced in 7bddd73 (https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/7bddd73f6e18bde931026abf5fe2526b747727ad) but I don't think reverting this change makes sense for efficiency reasons. Therefore we have two choices:
1. Change the index of SPECIALIZED flag so it gets pickled and set it before pickling happens (probably right before, it means in pickler).
2. Check for specialized annotation while unpickling symbols and set the flag there.

I like the first solution much better. We don't want to slow down unpickling.
This change is related to #5005 because once we generate correct specialized bridge methods we should unblock inlining.
In #5005 I noticed something similar, a specialized method not being generated for an anon-closure-class.

However, in that case and also here, a "correct" implementation for that method must be inherited, right? (Otherwise the bytecode verifier would complain).

Including the javap of `Inter` would help in visualizing the specialization vs bytecode-duplication tradeoff.

Miguel, here's the relevant bytecode (with Alex's fix applied):
```scala
Compiled from "check.scala"
public abstract class Inter extends java.lang.Object implements Foo$mcI$sp
public int foo$mcI$sp(int);
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=2
   0:	aload_0
   1:	iload_1
   2:	invokestatic	#11; //Method Foo$class.foo$mcI$sp:(LFoo;I)I
   5:	ireturn

```

```scala
Compiled from "check.scala"
public abstract class Foo$class extends java.lang.Object

public static int foo$mcI$sp(Foo, int);
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=2
   0:	aload_0
   1:	iload_1
   2:	invokestatic	#12; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToInteger:(I)Ljava/lang/Integer;
   5:	invokeinterface	#18,  2; //InterfaceMethod Foo.foo:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
   10:	invokestatic	#22; //Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt:(Ljava/lang/Object;)I
   13:	ireturn
```

```scala
Compiled from "check2.scala"
public class Baz extends Inter
public int foo$mcI$sp(int);
  Code:
   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=2
   0:	iload_1
   1:	iconst_1
   2:	iadd
   3:	ireturn
```

as you can see Inter just forward to Foo$class that in turns forwards to abstract, specialized method and takes care of boxing and unboxing.

The Baz class overrides specialized implementation and thus avoids boxing. I think this is really what we need.
Greg and I were checking this out and saw that there was another issue with:

```scala
trait Foo[@specialized(AnyRef, Int) A, @specialized(Boolean) B] {
  def apply(x: A): B
}


abstract class Inter extends Foo[String, Boolean]


class Baz extends Inter {
  def apply(x: String) = false
}
```

The `apply$mcLZ$sp` was not getting specialized in `Baz`, but just retained the bridge to `apply`. This should work now.


Here's the relevant commit:

https://github.com/axel22/scala-github/commit/830ba25e95e188189f8a11f806c41e7b5c1590b2
> Even if we set the flag before symbols pickling this won't help because
> only 32 lowest bits are pickled

Right, that's why I wasn't too concerned about putting it in uncurry, which I agree is arbitrary.

The phase called "superaccessors" which already is less than completely descriptively named should maybe be renamed - it's the only waystation between typer and pickler, and pickler should stick to pickling.
Incidentally, the flag/pickler relationship is more complicated, they are mapped in and out of the pickler space.  This should make it easier than you're thinking to add it.
```scala

  private def rawPickledCorrespondence = Array(
    (IMPLICIT, IMPLICIT_PKL),
    (FINAL, FINAL_PKL),
    (PRIVATE, PRIVATE_PKL),
    (PROTECTED, PROTECTED_PKL),
    (SEALED, SEALED_PKL),
    (OVERRIDE, OVERRIDE_PKL),
    (CASE, CASE_PKL),
    (ABSTRACT, ABSTRACT_PKL),
    (DEFERRED, DEFERRED_PKL),
    (METHOD, METHOD_PKL),
    (MODULE, MODULE_PKL),
    (INTERFACE, INTERFACE_PKL)
  )
```
As you can see from the 12 entries above, we're only using 12 flag bits at present:
```scala
  private final val PKL_MASK       = 0x00000FFF
```
Well, the pickler code is unnecessarily confusing - is it only masking out those 12 bits, letting the other 20 low order bits be pickled directly, and then shuffling around those 12? Maybe it is. Well, there's no way all those flags need pickling, and there are others which do.  See this comment in Unpickler:
```scala
        case EXISTENTIALtpe =>
          val restpe  = readTypeRef()
          // @PP: Where is the flag setting supposed to happen? I infer
          // from the lack of flag setting in the rest of the unpickler
          // that it isn't right here. See #4757 for the immediate
          // motivation to fix it.
          val tparams = until(end, readSymbolRef) map (_ setFlag EXISTENTIAL)
          newExistentialType(tparams, restpe)
```
It looks like shuffling the first 12 bits is exactly what it's doing.  For the love of god, WHY? Why why why...
