If you have a Java interface that could be a SAM:

{code}
public interface Foo<A> { public A aye(); }
{code}

And you refer to that from a Java interface that need not necessarily be a SAM:

{code}
public interface Bar<A> { public Foo<A> foo(); }
{code}

And you have a Scala trait that is supposed to give the SAM:

{code}
trait Baz[A] { def foo: Foo[A] }
{code}

And finally extend that trait and try to supply the SAM by getting it from the Java interface that can give you a SAM:

{code}
class Quux[A](bar: Bar[A]) extends Baz[A] { def foo = bar.foo }
{code}

you get a most peculiar error message:

{code}
found   : Foo[A]
required: A
  def foo = bar.foo
{code}

which only makes sense to me if the compiler has decided that it's got to synthesize the Foo SAM from scratch--no other way!--and then decides it's got to have an A to do it (never mind I'm giving it the already-existing SAM).

This only happens with {{-Xexperimental}}, and only (as far as I can tell) with this many steps: the original SAM, the Java source that returns a SAM, the trait specifying an SAM, and finally an implementation trying to hand off the Java SAM to the trait's method.
