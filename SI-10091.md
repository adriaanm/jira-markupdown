Given: trait with implemented protected method
When: instantiate that trait overriding protected method with public access modifier
Expect: overridden method is public
Actual: overridden method is still protected

Code:

```scala
class Test {

  trait I {
    protected def func(): Unit = println("hello")
  }

  trait PI extends I {
    override def func(): Unit = super.func()
  }

  val i = new I {
    override def func(): Unit = super.func()
  }

  val pi = new PI {
  }

  i.func() //still protected: method func in trait I cannot be accessed in Test.this.I
  pi.func() //works

}

```
