After creating a new class with the wizard, I've ended up with every file in the source folder being duplicated (screenshot attached).  This is eclipse 3.4.2 on a mac.  The only thing of note is that I'm using m2eclipse on this project as well.
Duplicate of #1636.

Fixed some time ago and trunk and now in 2.7.4.RC1 ... start here and upgrade,
