Annotating a primary constructor is pretty ugly.  For example:
{code}
@Component
class Foo @Autowired()(val bar: Bar) {
  //...
}
{code}

It would be nice if you could target what would normally be a class annotation at the primary constructor - for example:
{code}
object Annotations {
  type AutowiredConstructor = Autowired @primaryConstructor
}

@Component
@AutowiredConstructor
class Foo(val bar: Bar) {
  //...
}
{code}
Action on one ticket will probably have effect on the other one: SI-4242 / SI-5647.
