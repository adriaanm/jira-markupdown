There seems to be a workaround for the simpler case:
{code}
public interface A<T extends String> {
    T get();
}

public abstract class B implements A {}

class C extends B {
    this: A[_] =>
    def get = "foo"
}
{code}

If we could actually refer to the existential type used in the self type, this could probably also be used to work around the original issue.
