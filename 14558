In 2.8 (tested with 2.8.0.r18784-b20090925021043 and 2.8.0.r18844-b20091001024531):

Given this code with a context bound (but spelling out the implicit parameter gives the same result):
```scala
object EvidenceTest {
  trait E[T]
  trait A[T] { implicit val e: E[T] = null }
  class B[T : E] extends A[T] { override val e = null }

  def f[T] {
    implicit val e: E[T] = null
    new B[T]{}
  }
}
```

At "new B[T]{}" the evidence value is not found.

If I mark the override in B as implicit (or remove it altogether) it works (even though this value is never used -- the applicable implicit value is the one in f, not in A or B).

Changing "new B[T]{}" to "new B[T]" also makes it work.

It compiles successfully in 2.7.5 final.
