I copied the .log file to the .check file for #3224. But the test still failed. Here's the show-diff output:

> t3224.scala:29: error: polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;

1 of 1 tests failed (elapsed time: 00:00:03)
```
And here's the the .check file:
```scala
/home/odersky/workspace/scala/test/files/neg> cat t3224.check 
/home/odersky/workspace/scala/test/files/neg/t3224.scala:29: error: polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : [T]Array[T]
 required: List[?]
  println(Texts textL Array()); println(Texts textL Array(1)); println(Texts textL Array(1, 1))
                           ^
one error found
```
It seems to me that the new comparison will strip error messages in the .log output of their path prefixes, but will not do the same thing in the test file.

This complicates generating .check files a lot. Imagine you do a neg test which generates a 100 error messages. You'd need to edit the log in a 100 places to generate a good check file. Lots of opportunities to get this wrong...

For now I fixed neg/t3224.check by hand. But it would be good if that would not be necessary anymore; it certainly was not necessary in the past.
Another question.  The original checkfile you checked in for t3224 had your own path embedded in it:
```scala
/home/odersky/workspace/scala/test/files/neg/t3224.scala:29: ...
```
Are you sure this worked before? I'm skeptical because there are 671 checkfiles in trunk and 0 of them have the string "odersky" in them.  (There is one actually, shootout/message.check, but it has no corresponding test so it's not used.)
