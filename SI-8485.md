We use a custom annotation in Spark to indicate that certain classes are internal API's, it's called @DeveloperApi. In summary pages we've noticed only one of this annotation or the scaladoc will be displayed, never both. It seems to be sensitive to the order in which they are written.

```scala
// Case 1 - only the doc is displayed

/** Some doc here */
@DeveloperApi
class A
```

```scala
// Case 2 - only the annotation is displayed

@DeveloperApi
/** Some doc here */
class A
```

The desired behavior is that all of the annotations show up every time, regardless of whether there is a comment. The annotations are collapsed anyways, so I don't see why they couldn't always be included.
