Also, on 2.9.2 mutable.HashSet behaves awfully slow compared to immutable.Set:
(and its time grows even faster than n^2 on the set-diff test!)
```
scala> test(mutable.HashSet(), 10)
size: 10000; time: 0.203

scala> test(mutable.HashSet(), 100)
size: 100000; time: 36.0

scala> math.log10 (36.0/0.203)
res1: Double = 2.2488064628540743
```

I wonder if this can be caused by SI-5293?
