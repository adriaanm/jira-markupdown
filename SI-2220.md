In Scala 2.7.5 and in the current svn version it is not possible to access Scala functions with variable parameter lists from Java.

Here's an example which is rejected by the compiler:

Scala class:
```scala
object ScalaSeq {
  def f(seq: String*): String = ""
}
```

Java class:
```scala
public class ScalaSeqTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ScalaSeq.f("");
  }
}
```
This is basically a duplicate of #1342, which I have given a more revealing summary.
