I'm getting the same error while unpickling a case class with some `private val` s. I'm getting the error for only one of the fields even though there are other private and non-private `val` s of the same type ( `Map[Int, Double]` ). I tried changing the order of declaration of the fields in the class, changed the order of pickling the fields, still the same field causes the failure:
```shell
scala.ScalaReflectionException: Scala field currentMean  isn't represented as a Java field, neither it has a Java accessor method
note that private parameters of class constructors don't get mapped onto fields and/or accessors,
unless they are used outside of their declaring constructors.
```

scala version 2.11.7
java version 1.8.0_66
