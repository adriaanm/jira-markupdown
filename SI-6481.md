I have a class:
{code}
abstract class foo(a: Int, b: Int) extends scala.DelayedInit {
  def delayedInit(x: => Unit) {
    println("delayed init");
    x
  }
}
{code}
In the repl:
{noformat}
scala> new foo(1, 2) { println("in here") }
delayed init:
in here
res14: foo = $anon$1@17c95b4c
{noformat}
As expected.  It also works for foo(a = 1, b = 2).  However, if I supply named arguments in a different order to the way they are defined, then I get:
{noformat}
scala> new foo(b = 2, a = 1) { println("in here") }
in here
res20: foo = $anon$1@1f8bd6f9
{noformat}
and the delayedInit method isn't invoked.

The real world application I have of this is in Specs, when defining an Around scope that takes named parameters that have default values defined, such as these in Play framework:

https://github.com/playframework/Play20/blob/master/framework/src/play-test/src/main/scala/play/api/test/Specs.scala
For anyone looking to fix this, the situation is captured by my comment in Constructors:
{code}
      /** XXX This is not corect: remainingConstrStats.nonEmpty excludes too much,
       *  but excluding it includes too much.  The constructor sequence being mimicked
       *  needs to be reproduced with total fidelity.
       *
       *  See test case files/run/bug4680.scala, the output of which is wrong in many
       *  particulars.
       */
{code}
Specifically, "remainingConstrStats.nonEmpty excludes too much." I wouldn't expect any fixes to delayedInit though, certainly not from me.
