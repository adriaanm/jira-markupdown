The warning should not be issued for annotations that are elided by the compiler anyway, e.g. @BeanProperty:

{code}
scala> trait A {@BeanProperty var x: Int }
<console>:8: warning: no valid targets for annotation on method x - it is discarded unused. You may specify targets with meta-annotations, e.g. @(scala.beans.BeanProperty @getter)
       trait A {@BeanProperty var x: Int }
{code}
