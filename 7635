Was looking for the latest in resolving script paths and found my way to this issue.

If you take an even more perverse scenario:
{code}
relative/scala -> ../bin/scala
relative/again/scala -> ../scala
{code}
with multiple relative symlinks, then the fix in 4cd0253d0d also won't work.

Just trying something now that could be better. Will put it in a pull request.
