Right.  I forgot to include the information Iulian figured out.  The problem is the `a`.

If you update the script to:

{noformat}scala -nc -Yrepl-class-based
:load Fail.scala
val aaa = X
X = null
:load Fail.scala
X
:q
{noformat}

You'll see that `X` updates properly.

So, the `a` in the `def x = Seq.empty\[AnyRef\].reduce((a,b) => a)` and the top-level `a` in the REPL seems to trigger the problem.
