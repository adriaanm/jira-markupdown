```scala
import scala.annotation.varargs

abstract class VarargAbstractClass {
  @varargs
  def x(els: String*): Int
}
class ClassImplementsClass extends VarargAbstractClass {
  override def x(els: String*): Int = els.length
}
```

fails with an `AbstractMethodError` when the method is called from Java like this:

```scala
VarargAbstractClass i = new ClassImplementsClass();
i.x("a", "b", "c");
```

I first thought that this was related to #1459 but I know think it is a separate issue. It seems the main problem is that the forwarder in `VarargAbstractClass` is created as `abstract` because in Uncurry flags from the original method are just copied to the forwarder method. Clearing the `DEFERRED` flag for the forwarder method seems to fix this issue for me (but I didn't run the complete test suite to look for other problems).

Any idea when we might be able to fix this in a Scala 2.10.x release? If we can't fix this, we would be forced to rewrite the DataFrame APIs in Spark in Java, in order to support streaming functionality, which would require defining abstract vararg methods.


We should fix this in 2.11, but we're not planning to release further 2.10.x releases. https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.10.5 was the last one.
