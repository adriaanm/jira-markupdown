I found this bug when researching bug SI-2689 and reported it in a comment because I thought that it was the same bug. SI-2689 got fixed but this problem still remains.

_The general case_
 1. we introduce a compilation error in a file
 2. we save the file to compile
 3. edit and save another file to fix the issue (by adding a method for example)

A concrete example that reproduces the bug:
 1. Create and save a file A.scala like the following:
{code}
class A
class B
{code}
 2. Create and save a file C.scala like the following:
{code}
class C {
  val a: A = new B
}
{code}

B does not yet extend A so we correctly get the compilation error _type mismatch; found : B required: A_. Now if we change B to extend A and save A.scala the error message will get removed from the Problems View but not from the editor.
