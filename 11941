Thanks for fixing this so quickly guys. One question for you: Not knowing the internals of scalac very well, I don't know how or where `ICodeReader` is used. Clearly it must be used by the optimizer. Is this bug limited to `-optimise` or are there other things that could trigger the bug even without `-optimise`. In other words, is scala 2.11.7 immune to this issue if `-optimise` is not specified?
