Define the following:

{code}
trait Factory[T] { def apply: T }

trait Builder[C[_]] { def build[T](x: T): C[T] }

implicit val intFactory: Factory[Int] = new Factory[Int] { def apply = 42 }

implicit val listBuilder: Builder[List] = new Builder[List] { def build[T](x: T) = x::x::Nil }

implicit def containerFactory[C[_],T](implicit b: Builder[C], f: Factory[T]): Factory[C[T]] = new Factory[C[T]] { def apply = b.build(f.apply) }

def create[T](implicit f: Factory[T]): T = f.apply
{code}

Now we can use the `create` method:

{code}
scala> create[Int]
res9: Int = 42
{code}

But if we try to create a `List[Int]` we run into problems:

{code}
scala> create[List[Int]]
<console>:19: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Factory[List[Int]] was found.
       create[List[Int]]
       ^

scala> create[List[Int]](containerFactory)          
<console>:19: error: no implicit argument matching parameter type Builder[List[Int]] was found.
       create[List[Int]](containerFactory)
                         ^

scala> create[List[Int]](containerFactory[List,Int])
res14: List[Int] = List(42, 42)
{code}

The error message in the second call to `create` indicates that this is not just lacking type inference, but something seems wrong since `Builder[List[Int]]` is not even a legal type. 
again, a duplicate of SI-445... (I know, I'm beginning to sound like a broken record)

an implicit with a type constructor parameter requires type constructor inference, which we do not support. SI-445 essentially says that the compiler should report an error whenever a type constructor argument is omitted (and maybe we should emit a warning for implicit methods with type constructor parameters, as they will never successfully be inserted implicitly)

If someone feels up to the task of spec'ing a simple form of type constructor inference and implementing it, please do! (I don't even know the type inferencer well enough to overcome my fear of going in and  implementing SI-445 as a quick fix.. I should get around to it after the POPL deadline, though.)
