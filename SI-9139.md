I've been taking a look at how OpenJDK's JIT inliner works. We share many of the same guards: e.g we prevent inlining when there are exception handlers in bytecode we read via IcodeReader, when the callee is synchronized etc.

But I notice that we do not check whether the target and callee share the same strictfp setting.
