+1 Jason's trick is indeed clever; however, it is rather cumbersome for corralling calls to deprecated interface, class or constructor methods from a third-party library because one has to write different Scala code to call such deprecated methods so that we can compile with {{-deprecation}} and {{-Xfatal-warnings}}
