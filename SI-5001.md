The issues are specifically with the methods in TraversableLike that
use the newBuilder method and those that use the CanBuildFrom implicit.

The Collection Builder is elegant but it has a flaw that
limits one's ability to count on its results.
Specifically, when a Traversable is extended with with one
or more traits, the object returned from the methods that
rely on the Builder is a Traversable of the wrong type.

First a "newBuilder" method, "filter":

Consider the code:
{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
val a = new ArrayBuffer[Int]
a += 1
a += 2
a += 3
a filter {_ > 2}
res4: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(3)
{code}

Now consider the class:

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.SynchronizedBuffer
class SyncArrayBuffer[T]  extends ArrayBuffer[T] with SynchronizedBuffer[T]

val s = new SyncArrayBuffer[Int]
s += 1
s += 2
s += 3
s filter {_ > 2}
res11: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(3)
{code}

This does not work. It returns an ArrayBuffer NOT a SyncArrayBuffer.

How to fix this?
Try the class:

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.Builder
class SyncArrayBuffer[T]  extends ArrayBuffer[T] with SynchronizedBuffer[T]
    with Builder[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]] {
  override def result: SyncArrayBuffer[T] = this
  override def stringPrefix: String = "SyncArrayBuffer"
  override def newBuilder: Builder[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]] =
    new SyncArrayBuffer[T]
}

val s = new SyncArrayBuffer[Int]
s += 1
s += 2
s += 3
val x = s filter {_ > 2}
res: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = SyncArrayBuffer(3)
x.getClass.getName
res5: java.lang.String = SyncArrayBuffer
{code}

So, this version of SyncArrayBuffer works.
But, note all of the extra boiler-plate stuff that had to be added to:

{code}
class SyncArrayBuffer[T] extends ArrayBuffer[T] with SynchronizedBuffer[T]
{code}

to get it to work. How many Scala users will go that that effort?

Now consider a "CanBuildFrom" method, "map", specifically the case
where the "map" function simply returns the original collection:

{code}
map { v => v}
{code}

Consider the code:
{code}
val a = new ArrayBuffer[Int]
a += 1
a += 2
a += 3
a map {v => v}
res: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)
{code}

This works as expected, it returns an ArrayBuffer as it should.

Now consider the class:

{code}
class SyncArrayBuffer[T]  extends ArrayBuffer[T] with SynchronizedBuffer[T]

val s = new SyncArrayBuffer[Int]
s += 1
s += 2
s += 3
s map {v => v}
res: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)
{code}

This does not work. It returns an ArrayBuffer NOT a SyncArrayBuffer.

How to fix this?
Try the class take worked for "newBuilder" "filter" example above:

{code}
import scala.collection.mutable.Builder
class SyncArrayBuffer[T]  extends ArrayBuffer[T] with SynchronizedBuffer[T]
    with Builder[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]] {
  override def result: SyncArrayBuffer[T] = this
  override def stringPrefix: String = "SyncArrayBuffer"
  override def newBuilder: Builder[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]] =
    new SyncArrayBuffer[T]
}

val s = new SyncArrayBuffer[Int]
s += 1
s += 2
s += 3
s map {v => v}
res: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)
{code}

Nope, does not fix the problem, still returns an ArrayBuffer.

Now consider the following "simple" ArrayBuffer extension with a trait:

{code}
class SyncArrayBuffer[T] extends ArrayBuffer[T]
    with SynchronizedBuffer[T]
    with GenericTraversableTemplate[T, SyncArrayBuffer]
    with BufferLike[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]]
    with IndexedSeqOptimized[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]]
    with Builder[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]] {
  override def companion: GenericCompanion[SyncArrayBuffer] = SyncArrayBuffer
  override def result: SyncArrayBuffer[T] = this
  override def stringPrefix: String = "SyncArrayBuffer"
  override def newBuilder: Builder[T, SyncArrayBuffer[T]] =
    new SyncArrayBuffer[T]
}
object SyncArrayBuffer extends SeqFactory[SyncArrayBuffer] {
  /** $genericCanBuildFromInfo */
  implicit def canBuildFrom[A]: CanBuildFrom[Coll, A, SyncArrayBuffer[A]] =
      ReusableCBF.asInstanceOf[GenericCanBuildFrom[A]]
  def newBuilder[A]: Builder[A, SyncArrayBuffer[A]] = new SyncArrayBuffer[A]
}

val s = new SyncArrayBuffer[Int]
s += 1
s += 2
s += 3
s map {v => v}
res: SyncArrayBuffer[Int] = SyncArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)
{code}

That does it, the correct collection type is generated by the map method.

But how many Scala user when they extend a
Traversable with one or more traits are going to add all that
extra stuff just to get the correct Traversable result type
when using the thirty or forty TraversableLike methods that rely
of on a Builder? I bet no one does this and, secondly, I would
bet that most of them don't know there is a problem until it
runs over them.

Using code that relies on Builder with an Anonymous collection class
is worse, its just plain broken; there is NO way to fix it by flushing
out the class with methods and additional traits. Why? How does on
construct a companion object for an anonymous class?

{code}
val a = new SyncArrayBuffer[T] extends ArrayBuffer[T] with SynchronizedBuffer[T]
a filter {_ > 2} // returns ArrayBuffer
a map {v => v} // returns ArrayBuffer
{code}

These will return ArrayBuffers and with an anonymous class there is no where
to put the companion object. And, besides, the appeal of the
anonymous class is its simplicity.



So, how to deal with this hole in the collection Builder framework?

As I see it there are 4 options:

Option 1: Declare that its not a Bug but rather its a Feature.

  Or another way to say this is: When programming in Scala and one takes
  a sub-set of a collection, then there should be no expectation that
  the type of the sub-set bears any relation to the type of the
  original collection; the programmer should not have any notion
  of "behaves as expected" because it does not.

Option 2: Declare that it is a Bug and it will Not be fixed.

  While Scala should not have nooks and crannies where unexpected
  behaviors can arise, the collection Builder has such traps
  but it just not worth fixing.

Option 3: Implement https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SUGGEST-3

  In the case of the "filter" method and the other methods that
  rely on "newBuilder", rather than simply return the result of
  the Builder, the code should call the "expandTo" operator as
  described in Suggest-3:

{code}
  def filter(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
    val b = newBuilder
    for (x <- this)
    if (p(x)) b += x
    b.result.expandTo[getClass]
  }
{code}

  The "expandTo" operator is analogous to the "asInstanceOf" operator.
  It takes an instance and expands it, explicitly pimps it, into a
  derived type if possible (otherwise an Exception is thrown).

  In the case of a SyncArrayBuffer instance, the above "filter" method code
  is analogous to the following explicit pimped code:

{code}
  def filter(p: A => Boolean): Repr = {
    val b = newBuilder
    for (x <- this)
    if (p(x)) b += x
    b.result with SynchronizedBuffer[A]
  }
{code}

  except that the type returned is actually "SyncArrayBuffer[A]" and not
  just "ArrayBuffer[A] with SynchronizedBuffer[A]"


  "optionalExpandTo" is used, for example for the "map" function:

{code}
  def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = {
    val b = bf(repr)
    b.sizeHint(this)
    for (x <- this) b += f(x)
    b.result.optionalExpandTo[getClass]
  }
{code}

  Here, if the result type is a base-class of the type returned
  by the call to getClass, then the result is converted into an
  instance of the getClass type, otherwise, the result is returned
  unchanged. This covers the corner case where the "map" function
  simply returns a copy or sup-set of the original collection type.

  The up-side of using Suggest-3 is that Scala would then support
  explicit pimping and explicit pimping is vastly easier to use
  and understand than implicit pimping (their domain of usage
  do partially overlap). I would imagine that there would be a
  whole lot of explicit pimping going on once it was realized that
  one could (for better or worse) pimp objects return by
  third-party libraries.

  If this approach is taken, then this bug is not only a collection
  issue but also effect the language specification.

  Of course, I will admit that is faster to yield the incorrect
  collection type than using explicit pimping to produce the
  correct collection type, but I guess thats the trade-off isn't it.


Option 4: You are a bunch of smart folks, find a different solution.

  A number of times I've run across the unexpected behavior
  represented by this bug. I always struck me that its something
  that ought to be fixed.

Thanks.
