I'm trying to remember exactly why the restriction exists (5d9cde105e); I suspect it is because we can't define an $outer pointer. But I don't think that is relevant for this case.
```scala
class Foo extends AnyVal {
  def foo = () => 0 // okay
  def bar = {case x => x} : PartialFunction[Int, Int] // should also be okay IMO
}
```
