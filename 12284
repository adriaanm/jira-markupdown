Nope, it is seems unrelated. My patch for scala/bug#5070 doesn't help. (That said, you might want to look at the comments of that ticket again, Martin, as I showed an example where dotty's implicit search fails with dependent method types.)

The error in this ticket is:
```
âš¡ qscalac -Xlog-implicits test/files/pos/t9764.scala
test/files/pos/t9764.scala:7: AfromB is not a valid implicit value for Test.A[Test.C] because:
typing TypeApply reported errors for the implicit tree: type arguments [Any] do not conform to method AfromB's type parameter bounds [T <: Test.B[T]]
  implicitly[A[C]]  // fails
            ^
test/files/pos/t9764.scala:7: Test.AfromB is not a valid implicit value for Test.A[Test.C] because:
typing TypeApply reported errors for the implicit tree: type arguments [Any] do not conform to method AfromB's type parameter bounds [T <: Test.B[T]]
  implicitly[A[C]]  // fails
            ^
test/files/pos/t9764.scala:7: error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: Test.A[Test.C]
  implicitly[A[C]]  // fails
            ^
```

Which miminizes the problem to:
```scala
object Test {
  trait A[-T]
  trait B[-T]
  class C extends B[C]
  def AfromB[T <: B[T]]: A[T] = null
  AfromB : A[C]
}
```
