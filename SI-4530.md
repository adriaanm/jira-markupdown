GenSeq seems to aspire to unapplying:
```scala
abstract class GenSeqFactory[CC[X] <: GenSeq[X] with GenericTraversableTemplate[X, CC]] extends GenTraversableFactory[CC] {
  
  /** This method is called in a pattern match { case Seq(...) => }.
   *
   *  @param x the selector value
   *  @return  sequence wrapped in an option, if this is a Seq, otherwise none
   */
  def unapplySeq[A](x: CC[A]): Some[CC[A]] = Some(x)
}
```
But a GenSeq is not a Seq, so none of the parallel collections unapplySeqs are eligible.
```scala
An unapplySeq method in an object x matches the pattern x(p1, ..., pn) if it takes exactly one argument and its result type is of the form Option[S],
where S is a sub- type of Seq[T ] for some element type T . This case is further discussed in (ï¿½8.1.9).
```
All the references in the spec are to scala.Seq, which may or may not be desirable.  Section 8.1.9 says "if the extractor object x has an unapplySeq method with a result type conforming to Seq[S] ..." which is an error, it should be Option[Seq[S]].

This is not exactly an academic point because it's square in the middle of what I'm trying to fix right now.
(In r24883) Moved unapplySeq down to SeqFactory. Closes and fixes #4530.

Review by extempore.
