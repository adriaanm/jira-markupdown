Compile the following:

{code:title=testinherit.scala}
abstract class A {
  type Foo
  def bar(foo: Foo)
}

class BFoo {
}

class CFoo extends BFoo {
}

class B extends A {
  type Foo = BFoo
  def bar(foo: Foo) {
    println("B called")
  }
}

class C extends B {
  override type Foo = CFoo
  override def bar(foo: Foo) {
    super.bar(foo)
    println("C called")
  }
}
{code}

Result when compiling:

```
$ scalac testinherit.scala
testinherit.scala:22: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method bar in class B of type (foo: C.this.Foo)Unit
and  method bar in class A of type (foo: C.this.Foo)Unit
match argument types (C.this.Foo)
    super.bar(foo)
          ^
one error found
```

This error is, at the very least, extremely cryptic.

I encountered this recently and eventually figured out that I couldn't quite do what I was trying to do in code like the above.  Rather, I have to write class B like this:

```
abstract class B extends A {
  override type Foo <: BFoo
  def bar(foo: Foo) {
    println("B called")
  }
}
```

However, it took me a ****long**** time to figure this out.  The above error simply makes no sense whatsoever, because class A is totally abstract and class B is a subclass of A -- how could there possibly be an overload clash between a given class and its completely abstract parent?
The problem is that the error you see halts compilation before the error you should see is ever emitted, that being what you see if you comment out the override of bar in C:
```

./a.scala:23: error: overriding type Foo in class B, which equals BFoo;
 type Foo has incompatible type
  override type Foo = CFoo
                ^
```
"how could there possibly be an overload clash between a given class and its completely abstract parent?"

It's easy, because it doesn't matter what is abstract.  Overloading resolution does not ignore abstract methods - little would work correctly if it did.  Since the Foo in A and the Foo in B are different types, you arrive at an ambiguous overload pretty quickly.
Oh, and that's communicated via the other helpful error it shows if you comment out bar in C:
```
./a.scala:22: error: class C needs to be abstract, since method bar in class A of type (foo: C.this.Foo)Unit is not defined
(Note that A.this.Foo does not match B.this.Foo)
class C extends B {
      ^
```
