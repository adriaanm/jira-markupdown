The SLS in Section 6.3 lists six methods, which the null value is supposed to understand:
     eq, ==, ne, !=, isInstanceOf, and asInstanceOf
and then it continues :
  "A reference to any other member of the “null” object causes a NullPointerException to be thrown."

Apparently, this is not the case with the current compiler.

Changing the wording in SLS 12.3.1 only camouflages the problem.
