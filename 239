Well, kinda the opposite really. It would mandate the current behaviour of non-inference as required.

Would it be possible to consider statements of the form 

{code}
def foo = new Bar;
{code}

as explicitly defining a result type without having to write it as

{code}
def foo : Bar = new Bar;
{code}
