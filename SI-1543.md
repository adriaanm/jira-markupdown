{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.2.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_07).
{code}

Without scope, this works:

{code}
scala> class demo {
     |   private
     |   def foo = ()
     | }
defined class demo
{code}

With scope, there is a compile error:

{code}
scala> class demo {
     |   private[this]
     |   def foo = ()
<console>:2: error: expected start of definition
         private[this]
                      ^
{code}

The two-line style would be nice to have supported as we use it to keep line lengths manageable.
This is a duplicate of SI-442.
