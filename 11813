~/.m2 isn't safe to share with concurrent Maven processes.

This thread: https://www.mail-archive.com/jenkinsci-users@googlegroups.com/msg15507.html

suggests:
{noformat}
  -Dmaven.repo.local=${JENKINS_HOME}/${EXECUTOR_NUMBER}
{noformat}
To make sure each Jenkins executor has a separate cache. AFAICK ~/.ivy2 is safe to share, but out of paranoia you could use the same approach to spread these around.
