Thanks for taking a look guys. I'm not particularly adamant about the inclusion of all of these functions, however, I will make some points for you to consider:

* I agree that "bloating the API" should be avoided, however, when dealing with pure functions, users do not care about the number of those functions. They care about the interactions between functions that may side-effect upon each other. Consider java.lang.String with all its pure functions. No user has ever objected to the sheer number of these functions. I'd argue that a user of scala.Option would do same. Therefore, "bloating the API" has the definition of introducing functions that potentially side-effect on each other such that the class is significantly more difficult to reason about as each function is introduced. scala.Option does not have this problem.

* That a function can be written with a lower-order logic does not make its inclusion too trivial to necessitate. Writing software is all about creating a logical theorem (C-H Isomorphism) and if part of that proof has already been done, then I will simply not have to write it (and potentially make an error in doing so). The key question that should arise is "how often are users going to require this particular proof?". This brings up my next point.

* join is absolutely essential to Option (and any type that has flatMap for that matter). All monads have a join and users should not have to kludge it with .flatMap(identity). Option needs join.

* Option does have ifSome - it's just called foreach instead. If the collections don't have ifEmpty and/or ifNotEmpty, then they need them. In fact, this function can be generalised to a Foldable/catamorphism. Maybe Adriaan Moors is working on that.

* flatMapN is called "monad lifting"; folding is something else. I agree that we could achieve the same with for-comprehensions, but I'd still advocate the inclusion of the specific functions.

* What performance is lost in using ifNone and iif? They are certainly not a loss in clarity - since they can be shown to improve clarity (my earlier point about logical theorem).
