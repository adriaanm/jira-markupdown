this is a bit of a double-whammy:
  - `type I[+_] <: Sequence[_]`  mixes higher-kinded types and existentials, so that T does not conform to `++`'s bounds in `x . ++ [T]`
  - `x . ++ [T] y` is not the same as `x . ++ [T](y)` or `x ++  y`

The problem is that `inferPolyAlternatives` fails to find the right version of the overloaded method due to the second problem, which breaks the assumptions that the number of type arguments passed to a polytyped equals the number of parameters it expects. I replaced the assert by an if and put an errorTree in the failing branch. 

Martin, please review this change in r13917  (let me know if it's ok, and I'll copy it to the 2.7 branch)
