This issue is similar to SI-2144, but here, to avoid compile error, one gives the anonymous class some name. Here is the sample code:

{code:title=Bar.scala}

def convert[A] = {
  class C {
    def frob(a2: A) = a2
  }
  new C
}

System.out.println(convert[Int].frob(9))

{code}

This compiles, but fails in runtime with:

{code}
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Main$$anon$1$C$1.frob(int)
	at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1622)
	at Main$$anon$1.reflMethod$Method1(bug.scala:9)
	at Main$$anon$1.<init>(bug.scala:9)
	at Main$.main(bug.scala:1)
	at Main.main(bug.scala)
{code}
Duplicate of SI-2672.
Nothing? What do you think the "refl" in "reflMethod$Method1" means?

The class doesn't have a name by the time you leave the method because it goes out of scope.  The type which makes it out is a refinement.
