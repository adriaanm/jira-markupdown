Using   Scala Eclipse Plugin	2.8.0.r20428-b20100110035939	ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.feature.group

with the project located here: http://specs-users.googlegroups.com/web/spectest2.zip, I noticed if i do "Open Type" and enter "SimpleSpec" i get both
SimpleSpec and SimpleSpec$$ in the list

If I select SimpleSpec I get "Type demo.test.SimpleSpec could not be
found in spectest/test".....

Selecting SimpleSpec$$ locates the object as expected....

Not sure what the correct behaviour should be, but probably SimpleSpec should not be shown in the list?
