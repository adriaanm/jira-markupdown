I adjusted the patch a bit more, fine-tuned the css and refined font-selection. 

It prefers a font with better differences between I, l and O, 0 and use the same settings for all pages.

The font-family definition looks like this now:
`"Ubuntu", "Droid Sans", "Trebuchet MS", "Lucida Grande", "Lucida Sans", "DejaVu Sans Condensed", sans-serif;`

I attached a new patch.
