I think this following snippet should not compile (because the match does not contain an exhaustive set of cases): 
{code}
scala> object Enum extends Enumeration { val A, B, C = Value }
defined module Enum

scala> def foo(v : Enum.Value) = v match {
     | case Enum.B => println("B")
     | }
foo: (v: Enum.Value)Unit
{code}

It compiles and produces a MatchError at runtime:
{code}
scala> foo(Enum.A)
scala.MatchError: A
	at .foo(<console>:6)
	at .<init>(<console>:8)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:9)

{code}

Using scala 2.8.1.
Can this be upped to an enhancement request? I think that:

a) it breaks the principle of least surprise
b) it is something that can quite clearly be checked at compile-time


For better or for worse, `scala.Enumeration` is provided by the library, not the language. As such, it isn't afforded special treatment by the pattern matcher.

Perhaps this could provided by an IDE inspection. But I doubt you'll convince anyone that it could or should go in the pattern matcher, circa 2011.

I agree that special-casing Enumeration in the compiler is unlikely to happen, but it's interesting to think about how this kind of thing *could* be done in a general way.

CODE SKETCH, DO NOT COMPILE
{code}
case class sealed(value: Seq[_ <: Enumeration#Value] extends Annotation

object Foo extends Enumeration {
  @sealed(List(Foo1,Foo2)) // Probably doable, but smelly repetition
  @sealed(values)          // Too bad values is a def, not a stable identifier
  case class FooValue(i: Int, s: String, d: Double) extends Value(i, s)

  type Foo = FooValue

  val Foo1 = Foo(1,"One",1.0)
  val Foo2 = Foo(2,"Two",2.0)
}
{code}
Well, you can't pass arbitrary objects to annotations, they must be Contant Expressions (like literals, arrays, other annotations, or final vals, in an object, without type annotation, with a constant expression as the RHS.

You can pass type parameters though.
