(burmako in [r26081|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26081]) Reflection toolboxes now respect settings that are provided to them.

Before the fix CompilerCommand lacked the (args, settings, errorFn) ctor.
I added it and provided means to augment passed settings with custom errorFn.

Closes SI-5239. Review by odersky.
