I am happy to provide a fix for this, if required.

- Should the trim() code be added? Or documentation included explaining the behaviour?

On one hand, the behaviour seems inconsistent and the suggestion sounds reasonable.

On the other hand the behaviour is consistent with the documentation and semantics of the java7 methods.
- Double explicitly says "Leading and trailing whitespace characters in s are ignored"
 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#valueOf(java.lang.String)

 - Integer explicitly says the string "must all be decimal digits, except that the first .. may be '-'"
 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String,%20int)
