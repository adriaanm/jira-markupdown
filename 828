The package does not support Scala, but you can add an other language.

Attached you can find the definition of Scala ({{lstlang0.sty}}). You have
to copy this file into the directory "listings" of your latex distribution.

Usage:
{code}
\begin{lstlisting}[laguage=scala]
   val x = 1
\end{lstlisting}
{code}
