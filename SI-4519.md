=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

fsc's exit code is inverted (at least under Linux)

{code}
  bash$$ fsc IDoNotExist.scala
  bash$$ echo $$?
  0
  bash$$ fsc ProperCode.scala
  bash$$ echo $$?
  1
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Exit code is 0 on success, 1 on failure

=== What do you see instead? ===

1 on success, 0 on failure

=== Additional information ===
Echo is never disabled (as far as I can tell) except for Cygwin.  Why do all platforms try to re-enable it again?

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC2
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.04
