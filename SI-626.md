If I have two packages with the same final element then I get errors when attempting to reference classes across the packages.  Best illustrated with an example.

In file a/TestClass.scala I have the following:
{code}
package a
class TestClass
{code}

In file foo/a/TestClass2.scala I have the following:
{code}
package foo.a
import a.TestClass
class TestClassB
{code}

Produces the error

{{error: TestClassA is not a member of a}}

This is a consistent error regardless of what the last path element in the package name is.
Imports are relative in Scala, i.e., the compiler searches for `TestClass` in the innermost available package/val/object `a`, which is package `foo.a`. Hence, you are really trying to import `foo.a.TestClass`. Use the `_root_` prefix to make an import absolute:

{code}
import _root_.a.TestClass
{code}
