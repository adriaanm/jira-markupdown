I am using r20847 and I still see spurious errors :-(

From my testing so far the errors are greatly reduced but they still exist. At first I thought that the errors were only for packages and package objects but I also saw an error for an object. I will investigate this further and try to report specific ways to reproduce.

All the errors are for Scala top level elements that are defined in files that do not correspond to their qualified names that is why I reopen this issue instead of a new one.
