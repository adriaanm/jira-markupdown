The following code is rejected by the Scala compiler:

{code:title="J.java"}
public class Bar {  
};
```scala

Results in:

```
javasrc/javatest/Bar.java:5: error: illegal start of type declaration
};
  ^
{code}

According to the Java spec, `;` is legal in a type declaration list:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.6

The more serious issue is that the Scala compiler stops as soon as it finds syntax errors, so no errors are reported in Scala sources that come afterwards.
