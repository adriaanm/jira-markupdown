{{ 
scala> println({1 to 5}.map("n" + _)); 
RangeM(n1, n2, n3, n4, n5) 
{code}

The above code prints out a "RangeM" object, but there's no such class listed in the API docs.  (There's a "Range" object, of course).  Google searches didn't provide any insight into what the object was.

I don't know if this is a bug in something's toString method or whether the RangeM class is missing from the API docs.
RangeM means it's a Map projection of a Range. This should be explained better, as should many things in the collections. I'll leave the ticket closed, since we know that's something that will need to be done anyway.
