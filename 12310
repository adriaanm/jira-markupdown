Updatable is a SAM type. You'll see the new behavior in 2.11 under -Xexperimental. You'll see the old behavior under -Xsource:2.11.

When each A.apply takes a function parameter, then the args are typed with no expected type during overload resolution.

In the working case, the shape of the args selects only the alternative that takes a function.

This is discussed in the [announcement](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12.0-M4/) under breaking changes.
