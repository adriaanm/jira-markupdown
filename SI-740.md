Not sure ncs or eclipse plugin is a reason of the NPE, but last stack calls are nsc-related. Both (the language and the plugin) are r14637. Unfortunately, file under opening is too big and too invalid to prepare small use case. OTOH, if I understand correctly, any nsc-related exception is a bug.

Stack is attached.
Please see bug SI-738 about a related issue that was fixed by commit r14642 as well. It has a 6-liner test case that should make it easy to reproduce.
Please disregard my comments on the relation to bug SI-738, I messed something up and they are wrong.
