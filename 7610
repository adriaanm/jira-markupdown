Thinking more about it, I would rather improve the documentation for the root package than putting type aliases in the list: Program-wide type aliases are defined in the `scala` package and in `scala.Predef`, both of which are automatically imported. Since this solution would only work for half the problem (the `scala` package) I would suggest not putting in into practice, but rather thinking of a better alternative.
