Ant build target runs successfully.  Subsequently ran the 'dist' target which fails when running dependent target 'docs.lib'.  In docs.lib the root problem was the scaladoc command.

The error message complains that "Attribute 'srcdir' is not set."  However the scaladoc documentation says this should not be a problem if the command includes nested <src> elements (which it does).

output from 'dist' target:

{code}
Buildfile: C:\eclipse3.4\workspaceScala\scala source\build.xml
dist:
strap.clean:

docs.start:

Compilation was using revision 15601 of build.xml
Sorry to reopen, but....

Are you sure it can't be replicated?

I'm seeing the same behavior with an 2008-08-08 checkout
{code}
wednet% ant dist
Buildfile: build.xml

dist:

<snip>
docs.lib:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /Users/mike/Documents/My Documents/Programming Projects/scala-lang/workspace/scala/build/scaladoc/library

BUILD FAILED

The offending command:

{code}
    <scaladoc
      destdir="${build-docs.dir}/library"
      windowtitle="Scala Library"

Misterbeebee: When I first opened the ticket, I found this problem when making repeated builds from eclipse.  Eclipse 3.4 'clean' tasks were not always removing all the proper subdirectories under 'scala/build'.  Once I did a clean pull from svn I was able to get a successful build repeatedly as long as I manually cleared the 'scala/build' subdirectories.  Can you try clearing the build directory?

Also I find the build on my windows system fails every time on the 'fixcrlf' action during an attempt to apparently rename a temporary file.  I just commented out the 'fixcrlf' action for now.
