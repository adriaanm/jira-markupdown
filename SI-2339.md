I compiled a JAR out of a scala project.

Now I include this JAR into a java project but the scaladocs for the classes as well as for the methods are not displayed within the java project.

Great!  Unfortunately I am not running the nightly build.

Does it also work with JARs?
It should work with any source attachment. So yes, it will work with .jars.
