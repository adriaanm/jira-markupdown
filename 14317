IMO it should be possible to forward variables of the "repeated" type to other functions accepting the repeated type.

Example:
```scala
def apply (strings : String*) = {
  var x = List[String](strings)
}
```

This is currently not possible in Scala 2.7.5 but would be a very important feature. Even Java is capable of forwarding variable parameter lists (e.g. of type String...).
