I am using 2.11.7

It's a bit hard to boil down since I am seeing it when depending on Hadoop code which has a very deep dependency graph.

I'm instantiating GenericOptionsParser:
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.0.4/api/org/apache/hadoop/util/GenericOptionsParser.html
and Configuration:
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.6.4/api/org/apache/hadoop/conf/Configuration.html

and it is complaining about:

07:09:29 warning: Class org.apache.commons.logging.Log not found - continuing with a stub.
07:09:29 one warning found

which will be added to the runtime classpath, but is indeed not on the compile time classpath.

Jason replicated a test case:
