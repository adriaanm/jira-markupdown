This feels like a bug?

Compare:

```scala
object Bug {
  sealed case class Foo(e: Option[Int])

  def loop(t: Foo): Nothing = t match {
    case Foo(Some(_)) => ???
  }
}
/*
match may not be exhaustive.
[warn] It would fail on the following input: Foo(None)
[warn]   def loop(t: Foo): Nothing = t match {
[warn]                               ^
*/
```

to this, which is also not exhaustive but produces no warning:

```scala
object Bug {
  sealed case class Foo(e: Option[Int])

  def loop(s: Foo, t: Foo): Nothing = (s,t) match {
    case (Foo(Some(_)), _) => ???
  }
}
```

I know `Tuple2` isn't sealed, but that doesn't seem to explain it (problem occurs even using a custom sealed replacement for `Tuple2`, plus the stdlib tuples participate successfully in match exhaustivity checks in some other contexts).

Any ideas?
offhand, it looks similar to #6450. does it seem like a duplicate to you? or so close that it ought to just be a comment on that ticket? or is this actually quite distinct?
Hmm, I don't claim to be an expert, but I think they are quite distinct.  #6450 shows a false-positive in a seemingly yucky match involving wildcard types and `.isInstanceOf` and working directly with the `Some` class instead of `Option` class.  

#10019 (this ticket) shows a false-negative in a seemingly very simple case.
@adriaanm hesitating before just throwing this in the "Backlog" bucket, what do you think?
I found this surprising too:

```scala
def foo(t1: List[T], t2: List[T]) = (t1, t2) match {
  case (Nil, Nil) => ()
}
```

This code issues a warning:
{code}[warn] It would fail on the following inputs: (List(_), List(_)), (List(_), Nil), (Nil, List(_))}{code}

But this code issues no warnings:

```scala
def foo(t1: List[T], t2: List[T]) = (t1, t2) match {
  case (Nil, Nil) => ()
  case (List(_), List(_)) => ()
}
```

even though there are still missing cases.

Do you think it's related?
