Depending on how one came to Scala, one may view it as a Functional Language with OO, or an OO Language with Functional.  Ideally both should be correct, ie. Scala is unbiased expect to the eye of beholder.

Consider the 2 idioms.

object FunctionalIdiom {

  type A = Int
  type B = Int
  
  val f: (A) => B = 
    (x) => x + 1

  val g: (A) => B = 
    (x) => x + 2

  val h: (A, B) => B = 
    (x, y) => f(x) + g(y)

}

object ObjectIdiom {
  
  type A = Int
  type B = Int

  def f (x: A): B = 
    x + 1

  def g (x: A): B =
    x + 2

  def h (x: A, y: B) = 
    f (x) + g (y)
  
}


scala> FunctionalIdiom.h (2,3)
res0: FunctionIdiom.B = 8

scala> ObjectIdiom.h (2,3)
res1: Int = 8

Scala the language supports both idioms.  However, the compiler unnecessarily penalizes the functional idiom.  While a first class functional value is expected to involve overhead, in the above example the val bound function is fully known statically at compile time. 

The assumption is that the compiler should be able to flatten the reified function object and emit essentially the same code at the call site for FunctionalIdiom.f and ObjectIdiom.f

Currently this is not the case and code written in the Functional Idiom experiences an unnecessary 2x performance penalty.
