this should compile:

```scala
object Test {
  type Point = Map[Symbol, String]
  type Points = IndexedSeq[Point]

  def makePoints2: Points = IndexedSeq[Point]()
  val spoints2 = util.Random.shuffle(makePoints2)
}
```

instead it gives an error (which itself is buggy):
```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Test.Points
 required: ?CC[ ?T ]
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
```

(type variables should not occur in error messages)
(In r22796) closes #3777. type constructor inference now tries harder to unify a type constructor variable (that's applied to type arguments) with a type alias by dealiasing it, hoping to discover a concrete type constructor (that's applied to type arguments).
