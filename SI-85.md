A function is also a partial function, one where isDefinedAt always yields true.  Thus, the current direction of inheritance is backwards from the subtyping relation.

It would be tramatic to reverse the inheritance at this point, so how about we equate them?  The PartialFunction's would be aliases to the Function's, and there would be a default implementation of isDefinedAt that always returns true.

This shows up in practice if a function expects a PartialFunction and you try to pass it a closure.  By subtyping arguments, it would be polite of you to write as many methods as possible to accept PartialFunctions instead of merely complete functions.  Currently this is awkward in Scala, though, because if you accept PartialFunction's then callers cannot use any of the closure syntaxes to specify the argument!

It's not a big deal, but it is unhappy to explain, and upon seeing an explanation, theoreticians might well grouse.


Would the following definition in Predef solve the problem?

{code}
  implicit def functionToPartialFunction[A, B](f : Function1[A, B]) = new PartialFunction[A, B] {
    override def isDefinedAt(a : A) = true
    override def apply(a : A) = f(a)
  }

{code}

It looks like there are no major objections.  I certainly would like it to go in, because it will help with explaining to people how functions work in Scala.

The main issue is that this change will break binary compatibility, causing all jar's to need recompilation.  Thus, I will not do it just yet.  Does the EPFL gang have a release planned that will break binary compatibility, anyway?  I am assigning it to devteam for input.  Please choose the best milestone, including the immediate release if the binary compatibility break is acceptible.


I can do the coding when the time comes, since I asked for it, though volunteers would be welcome, too!  The main things to do will be:
 * Add a default isDefinedAt to Function1
 * Make "PartialFunction" a deprecated alias in Predef
 * Make the pattern matcher always generate isDefinedAt

Okay, it sounds like 2.6.2 is the milestone to target.  I'll work on this after 2.6.1 goes out the door.

BTW, I did some experimentation with the implicit conversion as I suggested earlier, and found it interfered with type inference, making it not so useful (can't remember the exact details, it was a while ago)

So I withdraw my implicit conversion suggestion, and I'm keen to see this change done as soon as possible :-)
