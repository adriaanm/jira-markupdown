Compile this under -optimise:
{code}
class A { def f1 = 3 max 4 }
{code}
You are treated to not one but two no-ops in the bytecode. First we have to load Predef, because maybe Predef hasn't been loaded yet. Then we have to load the RichInt companion object, because maybe that hasn't been loaded either. And if we mark max @inline, it won't make any difference.

Somewhat complementary, the @reallyStatic annotation (provisional name) appears more widely applicable (top level objects, value classes) and its prototype works fine for Mode, and other classes in the compiler.

For now the above can be seen in action only with the new backend (which is also doing fine)

[~rytz] any hope here with the new optimizer?
