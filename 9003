So inspecting the code in `inferExprAlternative`, it would appear that it could fall through if `best != NoSymbol && !competing.isEmpty && !noAlternatives && pt.isErroneous`.
```scala
        if (best == NoSymbol) {
          // ...
          NoBestExprAlternativeError(tree, pt, isSecondTry)
        } else if (!competing.isEmpty) {
          if (noAlternatives) NoBestExprAlternativeError(tree, pt, isSecondTry)
          else if (!pt.isErroneous) AmbiguousExprAlternativeError(tree, pre, best, competing.head, pt, isSecondTry)
        } else {
          tree.setSymbol(best).setType(pre.memberType(best))
        }
```

This commit seems relevant:

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b10b58
```scala
+        // since inferMethodAlternative modifies the state of the tree 
+        // we have to set the type of tree to ErrorType only in the very last
+        // fallback action that is done in the inference (tracking it manually is error prone).
+        // This avoids entering infinite loop in doTypeApply.
+        // TODO: maybe we should do the same thing with inferExprAlternative.
+        if (implicitly[Context].reportErrors) setError(tree)
```

It was refined later in: 

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/1ddc93

See also:
```scala
      // side-effect on the tree, break the overloaded type cycle in infer
      private def setErrorOnLastTry(lastTry: Boolean, tree: Tree) = if (lastTry) setError(tree)
```

Actually, digging back a bit further:

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/c800d1
```scala
         } else if (!competing.isEmpty) {
-          if (secondTry) {
-            typeErrorTree(tree, tree.symbol.tpe, pt)
-          } else {
-            if (!pt.isErroneous)
-              context.ambiguousError(tree.pos, pre, best, competing.head, "expected type " + pt)
-            setError(tree)
-          }
+          if (secondTry) NoBestExprAlternativeError(tree, pt)
+          else { if (!pt.isErroneous) AmbiguousExprAlternativeError(tree, pre, best, competing.head, pt) }
         } else {
```

Before that change, in the condition mentioned above, `setError(tree)` was called, which would have broken the loop.
