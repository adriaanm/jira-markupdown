It discards the parens early, as it means Tuple1.

Options for now are
{code}
scala> x.map(_.swap).apply(4)
res0: Int = 2

scala> Tuple1(x.map(_.swap))._1(4)
res1: Int = 2

scala> Tuple1(x.map(_.swap))
res2: (scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,Int],) = (Map(2 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 6 -> 3),)
{code}

Every since they mentioned the trailing comma, I see it everywhere.
