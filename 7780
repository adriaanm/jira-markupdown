This isn't limited to just implicits; the regression affects any case class with more than one parameter list:

{code}
case class Sad(i: Int)(j: Int)
Sad(0)(0).copy()()
{code}

In 2.9, this yielded another Sad(0)(0). In 2.10.0-M4, it's {{error: not enough arguments for method apply}}, thanks to the curried Function1 not having a default argument.
