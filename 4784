SI-3799 reports, that messages may be lost. In my example no message is lost, all messages remain in the actor's mailbox, but {{receiveWithin}} does not terminate after the timeout. Actually, the {{TIMEOUT}} message can be found in the mailbox. Note that this behavior changed from 2.7.7 to 2.8.0.

=> no duplicate.
