The following works in 2.9.1 (and earlier versions) but fails in trunk (2011-11-21):

```scala
object WithOpTest {

trait WithOp extends Cloneable {

  def f: this.type = this

  def g1: this.type = {
    f
  }

  def g2: this.type = {
    val t = f
    t
  }

}

}
```

Using f directly in g1 is OK but assigning it to an intermediate variable in g2 fails:

```scala
C:\Users\szeiger\Desktop>scalac Test.scala

C:\Users\szeiger\Desktop>c:\StandaloneApps\scala-2.10.0.r26037-b20111121023229\bin\scalac Test.scala
Test.scala:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : t.type (with underlying type WithOpTest.WithOp)
 required: WithOp.this.type
    t
    ^
one error found
```

Adding an explicit type annotation ": this.type" to t also makes it work.
