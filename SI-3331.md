Array.scala

```scala
  def fill[T: ClassManifest](n: Int)(elem: => T): Array[T] = {
    val b = newBuilder[T]
    var i = 0
    while (i < n) {
      b += elem
      i += 1
    }
    b.result
  }
```

I wonder why we need a Builder if we know the final size of Array. It's not a big problem but we'll have about log2(size) operations when building this way. Better is to create an array with provided size and then update every it's element with 'elem' function. 

The same is for 'tabulate' method.
(In r21667) Added size hints to Array.{ iterate, range, tabulate, fill }.
Probably closes #3331, but it would be nice if someone would measure
whether it makes much difference to skip the builder entirely in
those cases where that could be done.  No review.
Paul, can you please follow up on this issue, and close the ticket if you think the discussion is exhausted, or forward it to scala_meeting if you need additional input from Martin or other people.
(In r21710) Added size hints to builders where possible without introducing
new methods.  Closes #3331, review by community.
