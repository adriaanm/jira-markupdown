Some details, for the non-REPL scenario:
```
class ScalaColls(n: Int) {
  () => n 
}
```

The only difference {{-optimize}} makes is inlining (in {{ScalaColls$$anonfun$1.apply()}}) the getter that {{ScalaColls}} provides for {{ScalaColls$$n}} (that field was public final already before inlining). 

In other words `ScalaColls$$anonfun$1.apply()` goes from:
```
public final int apply();
  Code:
   Stack=1, Locals=1, Args_size=1
   0:	aload_0
   1:	invokevirtual	#25; //Method apply$mcI$sp:()I
   4:	ireturn
```

to:
```
public final int apply();
  Code:
   Stack=1, Locals=1, Args_size=1
   0:	aload_0
   1:	getfield	#24; //Field $outer:LScalaColls;
   4:	getfield	#28; //Field ScalaColls.ScalaColls$$n:I
   7:	ireturn
```
