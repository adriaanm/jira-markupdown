Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19371-b20091102102036 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

This is a build manager issue that can be reproduced using !BuildManagerTest.

Given A.scala, B.scala with contents:
{code}
class A {
	def x(i: Int) = i+"3"
}
class B extends A {
	def x(s: String) = s+"5"
}
{code}

 1. Compile both sources
 1. Modify 'x' in A.scala to be:
{code}
	def x(i: String) = i+"3"
{code}
 1. Mark A.scala modified
 1. The build manager will recompile A.scala, but not B.scala.  If B.scala were recompiled, there would be an error that 'override' is required.

A small modification is still incorrect.  Make the initial contents:

{code}
class A {
	def x(i: Int) = i+"3"
}
class B extends A
class C extends B {
	def x(s: String) = s+"5"
}
{code}

Only B is recompiled.
A related case no longer works in Beta1-RC7 and r20428:

W.scala
{code}
class W
{
	def x = 3
}
class V extends W
{code}

Y.scala
{code}
object Y
{
	def main(args: Array[String]) =
		println( (new Z).x )
}
{code}

Z.scala
{code}
class Z extends V
{code}

 1. Compile
 1. Remove `extends W` from V.
 1. Mark W.scala modified.  Only Z.scala is recompiled, missing compile error in Y.scala:
{code}
Y.scala:4: error: value x is not a member of Z
                println( (new Z).x )
                                 ^
{code}
(In r20624) Closes SI-2653, SI-2652, SI-2556. The last one required more sophisticated mechanism for detecting invalid references to inherited members, but at least it doesn't seem to cause unnecessary recompilations.
