This does not compile in 2.10, but does in master.
```scala
class Foo { def f = 5 }
class Bar extends Foo { private def f = 10 }
```
I think it regressed in e609f1f20b . The test case run/private-override.scala looks wrong - class Other is supposed to be in some package other than p2 to test what it is intending to test. I believe that bug is legit, just the test case is wrong, but also that it is the change which accompanied it which caused the bug being reported here.
