2.7.1.RC2

I expect object apply method called.
No, it was a mistake. I had tried it in the interpreter, where it works.

I believe it works because the interpreter wraps every line into a new object. The object where the case class defines its factory (apply method) wasn't the same as the object of the same name, since they were in different objects.

In other words, whilst the buggy situation is equivalent to the following.

{code}
case class A()
object A {
  def apply() = ...
  def apply() = ...
}
{code}

The interpreter-based situation would be the following.

{code}
object Line1 {
  case class A()
  object A { def apply() = ... }
}
object Line2 {
  object A { def apply() = ... }
}
{code}

Which is fine.



I think the relevant code is around scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Namers.scala:574 
{code}

      // add apply and unapply methods to companion objects of case classes,                                                                                                       
      // unless they exist already                                                                                                                                                 
      caseClassOfModuleClass get clazz match {
	case Some(cdef) =>
          addApplyUnapply(cdef, templateNamer)
          caseClassOfModuleClass -= clazz
        case None =>
      }
{code}

I tried something like


{code}
    def addApplyUnapply(cdef: ClassDef, namer: Namer) {
      // does not yet take into consideration an overloaded "apply" method.
      if (!(cdef.symbol hasFlag ABSTRACT) && cdef.symbol.info.member(newTermName("apply")) == NoSymbol)
        namer.enterSyntheticSym(caseModuleApplyMeth(cdef))
      namer.enterSyntheticSym(caseModuleUnapplyMeth(cdef))
    }
{code}


But still
/opt/repos/scala-trunk/testing $$ ../build/quick/bin/scalac Foo.scala
Foo.scala:7: error: method apply is defined twice
case class Foo(lx: int)
           ^
one error found


With some printlns:
{code}
    def addApplyUnapply(cdef: ClassDef, namer: Namer) {
	println("trying to add apply and unapply")
      if (!(cdef.symbol hasFlag ABSTRACT) && cdef.symbol.info.member(newTermName("apply")) == NoSymbol)	{
	println("adding apply")
        namer.enterSyntheticSym(caseModuleApplyMeth(cdef))
      }
	println("adding unapply")
      namer.enterSyntheticSym(caseModuleUnapplyMeth(cdef))
    }
{code}

/opt/repos/scala-trunk/testing $$ ../build/quick/bin/scalac Foo.scala
trying to add apply and unapply
adding apply
adding unapply
Foo.scala:7: error: method apply is defined twice
case class Foo(lx: int)
           ^
one error found

Actually, this is according to the spec (Section 5.3.2 Case Classes):

  ...
  If a type parameter section is missing in the class, it is also missing in the apply
  and unapply methods. The definition of apply is omitted if class c is abstract. The
  name of the unapply method is changed to unapplySeq if the first parameter section
  ps1 of c ends in a repeated parameter of (ï¿½4.6.2). If a companion object c exists al-
  ready, no new object is created, but the apply and unapply methods are added to
  the existing object instead.

Note that you can work around this issue by declaring the case class *abstract*.
