Found this place for improvement while debugging dotty:
{code}

def flatten(trees: Tree): Int = {
      trees match {
        case Thicket(elems) =>
          
        case tree =>
          33
      }
    55
  }
{code}
Both branches of match are adapted to common erased return type. This type is j.l.Object. This will force both 33 and Unit to be boxed, which is unneeded, as those values aren't used.
