I'm reopening this for reconsideration, because "this" is a real problem if one attempts, for example, to move foreach into an extension method.  It means you can preserve the source compatibility of calls to foreach almost everywhere, but not when a class invokes foreach on itself like
```scala
class X extends Seq[Int] { def bippy = foreach(println) }
```
because it ignores the implicit.  To me it is far more regular to have the type of the receiver dictate which implicits are eligible, including when the receiver is the invisible this.  Now that we have extension methods which offer significant advantages, others will run into this as well.
