When using the methods Actor.link/unlink and exit the variable links is changed/read without locking. This may cause an update to the variable to be lost. Locking should be added to ensure consistent updates to this variable.

Since two Actor instances are involved in a link/unlink operation locking must be ordered to avoid deadlock.
I fixed the problem in r14264 (2.7.0 branch) and r14265 (trunk) as follows: first, `link`/`unlink` may only be called on `self`. This is enforced at run-time using an `assert`. Second, when calling `self.link(other)`, then the update of the links in `other` is protected by the lock of `other`.

This ensures the following properties:

  * Concurrent updates are not lost
  * Two concurrent `link` calls cannot deadlock
  * The links on the two sides are updated atomically
