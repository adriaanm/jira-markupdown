Sorry I missed this the first time around... exposing clone() was the hard part, this would have been the easy part.
```scala
// The JLS says an Array implements java.io.Serializable and java.lang.Cloneable.
// As seen here.
class J {
  public static void f(Cloneable x) { }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    f(args);
  }
}
// % javac J.java
// %
```
```scala
// We are Serializable but not Cloneable (although clone() is there.)
object s {
  def f(x: Cloneable) = ()
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    f(args)
  }
}
// % scalac s.scala 
// s.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
//  found   : Array[String]
//  required: java.lang.Cloneable
//     f(args)
//       ^
```
(In r24510) Removed long deprecated and obscure CloneableCollection.
Discovered we have a scala.collection.mutable.Cloneable which
does not extend java.lang.Cloneable, which is why Array is not
considered cloneable.  That seems wrong, but to be conservative
I gave Array the Cloneable interface without altering the scala
trait.

Also, if @serializable is deprecated in favor of Serializable,
should not @cloneable be deprecated analogously? Closes #4307,
and a commit-question review by rytz.
