Footnote, javax.tools is not tools.jar.

The error Eugene mentioned on the ML was:
```
Unfortunately my attempts to test scala-IDE locally with 2.11.0-SNAPSHOT failed:

 "Unable to satisfy dependency from org.scala-ide.scala.compiler
2.11.0.v20130225-064029-f2be783020 to package javax.tools 0.0.0.", "No
solution found because the problem is unsatisfiable."]
```
