It compiles both before and after 0cde930b . The point between 2.9 and 2.10 when it started working was 658ba1b4e6, which makes sense given the test case:
{code}
// test/files/pos/hkrange.scala
class A {
  def f[CC[X] <: Traversable[X]](x: CC[Int]) = ()
  
  f(1 to 5)
}
{code}

     Fixed adriaan's patch for type constructor inference. The problem with
     haranguing people in bars about bugs is that the fixes with which they
     provide you may be flawed. Fortunately moors has this novelist on
     retainer. Review by moors.
