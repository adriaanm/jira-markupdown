Here's the story. 

Remove some redundant code
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b2f3fb271342d7862cc045f5ee5cff6815ac9722

Remove the code that it was redundant to, so now it
can't work
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/beb875187914b12b1b9dbb5621447067e2926c7c

Then destroy the evidence that it ever existed
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/ffc2389840852a120fecd772206d55db9a79f30e

Moral of the story: tests are good.
