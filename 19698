The following code:
```scala
object Foo {
  /**
   * @throws java.lang.Exception
   */
  def bar = ()
}
```

causes scaladoc to emit the following warning:
```scala
[warn] /Users/jroper/tmp/scaladoc-link/Foo.scala:2: Could not find any member to link for "java.lang.Exception".
[warn]   /**
[warn]   ^
[warn] one warning found
```

Two problems here:

# The warning shouldn't be emitted, this warning makes it impossible to enabled -Xfatal-warnings
- The line of code that its reported on is off by one
