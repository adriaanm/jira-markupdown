Sorry, I didn't spot that you'd already specified Mavan in the bug report. Unfortunately it seems to be swallowing the interesting part of the exception stack trace (in a similar manner to the default behaviour of SBT!)

Is your project in an encrypted home directory in Ubuntu? The long class names generated by heavily nested closures (as are generated in for comprehensions with many generators) can exceed the maximum file path allowed. See for example https://github.com/scala/pickling/issues/10 / http://brianoneill.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/file-name-too-long-in-scalasbt-on-ubuntu.html
