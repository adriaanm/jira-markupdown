With 2.10.0-M5 ~~explaintypes got much more verbose, compared to (for instance) Scala 2.9.x ~~ it produces extra output even when compilation does not fail.
While this might be done to help debugging, I don't think this is justified even for an intermediate release - debugging stuff should have separate options.

This problem was already briefly discussed on scala-language; Daniel Sobral suggested a bug report.
