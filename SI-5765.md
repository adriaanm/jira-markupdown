I know that trait Set extends (A) => Boolean, but it wouldn't have to.  Does anyone use it this way?

mySet.contains also extends (A) => Boolean, and IMO is more readable.

I don't think I have to convince this crowd of the usefulness of covariant collections.  What am I missing?

Thanks,

That `contains` does not take objects of type `A`:

{code}
    def contains(elem: Any): Boolean = exists (_ == elem)
{code}

Why doesn't `Set.contains` also take `Any`? Probably historical reasons + `contains` is used much more often with a `Set` than with a `Seq`, so type-safety is more desirable.
