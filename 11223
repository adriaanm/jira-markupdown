I sympathize, but the upgrade to jline 2.12 was motivated by the issues collected under scala/bug#8595, so, reverting to 2.11 would upset other users. I apologize for the inconvenience, but we're caught between two mythological unpleasant places, as they say. Ideally, jline would fix the upstream issue (https://github.com/jline/jline2/issues/156), and we'd upgrade again. If someone has a patch for jline, we'd also be willing to consider upgrading to that custom version, but, in reality, the core team can't afford to maintain forks of our dependencies ourselves.
