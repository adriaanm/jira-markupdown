{noformat}
object O { O() }
case class O private (x: Int = 3)
{noformat}

gives (in 2.11.0-M4)

{noformat}
warning: private default argument in object O is never used
       case class O private (x: Int = 3)
                             ^
{noformat}

but it is; it's used from the companion object.

Actually the default arg to the constructor is never used. If the constructor is private, then the apply is not rewritten to new, neither within the companion nor within the case class itself. What is used is the public default arg to apply.

It probably shouldn't warn about the synthetic member anyway. Edit: The warning intentionally warns about unused default getters. One can also ask whether the apply defaults should forward to the ctor defaults.

This fix has the case apply transform also transform the default arg getter that is invoked.
