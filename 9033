not directly, I think

I have fixes in the pipeline so that both methods are 28 bytes long 
under -optimize (exactly the same)

without -optimize, foo is 38 bytes and bar is 34 bytes long,
essentially due to the conflicting requirements of scala/bug#5158 (store subpatterns in local variables to improve debuggability)

As soon as I have the tests implemented (using Greg's new bytecode testing framework), I'll submit a PR.
