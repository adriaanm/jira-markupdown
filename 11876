A bit more background info:

Spark builds against these dependencies ([~pwendell], let me know if I missed something):

- Hive 0.13.1, [which links to jline 0.9.94](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-0.13.1/pom.xml#L120)
- Hive 0.12.0, where I couldn't find the jline dependency version (it's an ant + ivy build), but it's safe to assume it's even older

Hive master seems to be on jline 2.12, which is the same as Scala.

While running `sbt evicted`, this shows up, confirming the dependency conflict:
```scala
[warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies.
[warn] Here are some of the libraries that were evicted:
[warn] 	* jline:jline:0.9.94 -> 2.12.1
[warn] Run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings
```
