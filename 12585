I don't know the specifics if this is the same place in code or not, but overloading with curried params results the same problem, regardless of using or omitting type parameter... 
{code:scala}
object A{

  fun[Int]{
    case _ => 1
  }

  def fun[T](f: PartialFunction[Any, T]): T = {
    f(1)
  }

  def fun[T](v: Int)(f: PartialFunction[Any, T]) = {
    f(v)
  }

}
{code}
