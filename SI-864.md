Given that 
{code}
scala> classOf[Int]
res6: java.lang.Class[Int] = int
{code}
It should be the case that the following works
{code}
scala> 1.getClass
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: ?{val getClass: ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2Integer in object Predef of type (Int)java.lang.Integer
 and method intWrapper in object Predef of type (Int)scala.runtime.RichInt
 are possible conversion functions from Int to ?{val getClass: ?}
       1.getClass
       ^
{code}
The proper fix for this issue is that described in SI-496. I will therefore mark it as a duplicate.
I am not sure I see how fixing SI-496 is supposed to resolve this unless you want the default implicit conversion to be to RichFoo.  Is that the plan?
Since `getClass` mostly makes sense within the scope of (Java) reflection and since reflection uses the boxed versions of values (`Integer` for `int`, etc) it may be logical to have `1.getClass` return `classOf[Integer]`.

In that sense fixing SI-496 may still fix that issue.

I agree this would be a situation where Scala's object model would loose some of its purity by exposing the messy boxing business. On the other hand, when doing reflection, one has to deal with it.

Let's decide once we have a better idea on how Scala's own reflection system will look.
this was fixed by Paul in r25173. see also SI-496
