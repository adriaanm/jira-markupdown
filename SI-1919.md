Versions:
Scala Plugin: 2.7.4final
Eclipse: 3.5M5 I20090202-1535

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create an RCP plugin.
2. Add Scala nature to it.
3. Create a Scala class in it and use it.
4. Create a product definition for the RCP application.
5. Export the product and run it.

Result:
The Scala source files are copied to the plugin bundle instead of the compiled .class files. Hence the exported product will abort with the following log message:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 4 0 2009-04-25 02:30:41.052
!MESSAGE Application error
!STACK 1
java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
ExampleClass could not be resolved

More information:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Scala_Bundle#Build_the_scala_bundle_jar explains the problem. Maybe you should file a bug to the Eclipse PDE bugzilla requesting the necessary changes to the PDE build process.
I'm puzzled. This should work ... can you send me an *absolutely* minimal project which illustrates the problem.

Nb. as of 2.7.4 that eclipse.org wiki page is wrong: you shouldn't have the Java builder in your .project, only the Scala builder (which will invoke the Java builder internally as necessary).

Could you follow the trouble-shooting instructions [http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94 here] and let me know how you get on. I suspect that heap configuration is the issue in comment SI-3.
Sorry, I forgot to include scala.library to the plugin dependencies and to the run configuration. Now, I could reproduce the problem. The exact steps:
* Create a plugin project with the following settings: create RCP application: yes, template: Hello RCP, add branding
* Create a Scala class (e.g ScalaTest) with a method, instantiate it and call the method (e.g. in Activator.start())
* Create a product definition using the existing product
* Export the product (don't generate metadata repository)
The problem: Now you can see that in the exported product, the plugin's jar contains only the source (.scala) of the Scala class, and not the compiled bytecode (.class). This occurs despite that the plugin's bin directory contains the correct class files.
Hence the product won't start, and in the log, the following exception can be seen:

java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
	ScalaTest cannot be resolved to a type
Right, so this is a known proble (largely fixed on trunk). The Java presentation compiler (which is responsible for the annotations you're seeing) isn't always aware of Scala constructs and hence give spurious reports. The Java build compiler, on the other hand, is quite happy so your build is successful and there are no problems listed in the Eclipse Problems view.

The workaround is to pay attention only to errors in Java source referencing Scala if there is a corresponding problem listed in the Problem view.

Aside from this, are you able to export your project?

That should have been "but links to it *don't* belong in comments on this ticket".
I've tested this issue with r19928 and unfortunately the bug is still valid. I followed the procedure outlined in comment: https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/1919#comment:5 and the jar file in the exported product contained the .scala file not the .class.
