Eclipse provides two options relating to indentation:

 || _Setting_ || _Type_ ||
 || !InsertSpacesForTabs || Boolean ||
 || !DisplayedTabWidth || Integer ||

These settings appear within:

    [Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors].

On my system, changing these settings has no effect on the Scala editor's indentation style. For example, I could choose the following settings:

 || _Setting_ || _Value_ ||
 || !InsertSpacesForTabs || false ||
 || !DisplayedTabWidth || 4 ||

After choosing the above settings, the Scala editor continues to indent code as if I had chosen the following settings:

 || _Setting_ || _Value_ ||
 || !InsertSpacesForTabs || true ||
 || !DisplayedTabWidth || 2 ||

Please could the Scala editor indentation engine be extended to use these global settings?

Many thanks for a great plug-in.

This is a duplicate of #1733. See comment 6 of that ticket for a workaround.

lampion.presentation.AutoEdits is long gone thank goodness.
