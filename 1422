I just noticed that scala.tools.eclipse.Nature#configure also attempts to permanently disable the "scrub output folders" option, but this doesn't work in my environment. Stepping through the JDT code (org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.builder.BatchImageBuilder#cleanOutputFolders), the option is always enabled for Scala projects. Is it dependent on the Eclipse version? My environment:[[BR]][[BR]]

Eclipse SDK[[BR]]
Version: 3.4.1[[BR]]
Build id: M20080911-1700[[BR]]
JDK 1.5.0.17 64-bit[[BR]]
Windows Vista 64-bit
