This bug only occurs when the Scalac -optimise flag is used. Thus, the tests passed during development but failed during release.

The compiler appears to be too aggressive when inlining. The application's stacktrace indicates that the client library is directly invoking the package-private Java class. This was noticed as a Java class is used as an adapter to expose a protected static method in an external library. A Scala object is the proxy for the application. Below is a skeleton of the code.

// Java
package abc;
final class Foo {
  private Foo() {}

  public static void hello() {
    Adapter.hello();
  }

  private static final Adapter extends xyz.Foo {
    public static void hello() {
      printHello();
    }
}

// Scala proxy
package abc
object Bar {
  def hello() = Foo.hello()
}

// Scala client
package efg
final class Baz {
  def speak() = Bar.hello()
}

This may be related or a duplicate of #1430.
Also, as noted I don't yet know what bug you are reporting, but I fixed #1430, so you might want to check if that made any difference.
