Calling ".view.zipWithIndex" on a String will cause an Out Of Memory Exception on Scala Beta1-RC6. It can be triggered by something as simple as this:

```scala
"".view.zipWithIndex
```

It is not related to the string being empty. Non-empty strings will cause the same error.
perhaps #2876 is related

Oh and actually I meant #2876 is definitely me, but this is probably me too.
