It seems {{BasicTransformer}} has exponential complexity on the nesting level of the XML being processed. This is due to this method:

{code}
  def transform(ns: Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] = {
    val (xs1, xs2) = ns span (n => unchanged(n, transform(n)))
    
    if (xs2.isEmpty) ns
    else xs1 ++ transform(xs2.head) ++ transform(xs2.tail)
  }
{code}

Each modified node is transformed twice: once at the span, and again at the if/else. So, for {{<a><b><c><d/></c></b></a>}}, with c being modified, node a gets transformed twice, node b gets transformed four times (twice for each time a is transformed), and node c gets transformed eight times.

I propose the following rewrite of that method as a fix:

{code}
  def transform(ns: Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] = {
    val xs = ns.toStream map transform
    val (xs1, xs2) = xs zip ns span { case (x, n) => unchanged(n, x) }
    
    if (xs2.isEmpty) ns
    else (xs1 map (_._2)) ++ xs2.head._1 ++ transform(ns drop (xs1.length + 1))
  }
{code}

I considered modifying {{unchanged}}, but, as a protected method, it is part of the API. Also, {{ns take xs1.length}} might be better than {{xs1 map (_._2)}}. This whole method could probably be made more efficient with a carefully constructed while loop, I think, but this, at least, solves the complexity problem.
