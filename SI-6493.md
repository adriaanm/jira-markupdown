Here is the smallest case I could generate:

{code}
scala> def foo = { class Foo { class Bar { val b = 2 }}; val f = new Foo; new f.Bar }

java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: f.type
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$adaptToNewRunMap$.adaptToNewRun(Types.scala:3945)
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$adaptToNewRunMap$.apply(Types.scala:3989)
	at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$adaptToNewRunMap$.apply(Types.scala:3921)

{code}

I was originally playing around in the interpreter trying to understand the Currency examples in Ordersky Ch.20 and ran into this by doing the following.  Note how it accepts the definition once and then break when I attempt to redefine it in exactly the same way.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around path dependent types - so I don't have much more useful debugging info.

{code}
scala> abstract class Outer { abstract class Inner { val v = 1 } }
defined class Outer

scala> def doSomething(n: Int) = { object O extends Outer { class I extends Inner { val y = n } }; new O.I }
doSomething: (n: Int)O.I forSome { val O: O; type O <: Outer with ScalaObject{type I <: this.Inner with ScalaObject{val y: Int}} }

scala> def doSomething(n: Int) = { object O extends Outer { class I extends Inner { val y = n } }; new O.I }
doSomething: (n: Int)O.I forSome { val O: O; type O <: Outer with ScalaObject{type I <: this.Inner with ScalaObject{val y: Int}} }
java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: O.type

In 2.10 this gives the following, which is pretty cool because it involves multiple, far-flung bug fixes.
{code}
scala> def foo = { class Foo { class Bar { val b = 2 }}; val f = new Foo; new f.Bar }
foo: Object{type Bar <: Object{val b: Int}}#Bar
{code}

That's cool!  I updated to scala 2.10.0-M7 and retried:

{code}
scala> def foo() = { object Foo { class Bar { val x = 1} }; new Foo.Bar }
foo: ()Object{type Bar <: Object{val x: Int}}#Bar

scala> foo()
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: .foo()Ljava/lang/Object;
	at .<init>(<console>:9)
	at .<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:7)
{code}
Now it typechecks..  but doesn't run.  Is this expected?  Sorry I elided the "new Foo" bit and just made an object Foo.  Doing it the long way also raises an exception.
As is typically the case with seemingly repl bugs, this is a compiler bug with separate compilation.
{code}
// a.scala
object one {
  def foo() = { object Foo { class Bar } ; new Foo.Bar }
}
// b.scala
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = one.foo
}
% scalac210 a.scala && scalac210 b.scala && scala210 Test
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: one$.foo()Lone/foo$Foo$Bar;
	at Test$.main(b.scala:2)
	at Test.main(b.scala)
{code}
Affects all versions back to at least 2.8.
I'd point the finger at erasure.

{code}
    // end of uncurry
    <method> def foo(): lang.this.Object{type Bar <: lang.this.Object}#Bar = {
    // end of erasure
    <method> def foo(): Foo.Bar = {
{code}

I'd expect the return type to erase to `Object`.

Seems like we get away with this under joint compilation.
I was too quick to blame {{erasure}}. A corrupt {{TypeRef}} is being passed all the way from {{typer}}.

{noformat}
<method> def foo#7445(): scala#21.this.AnyRef#2222{type Bar#12153 <: scala#21.this.AnyRef#2222}#Bar#12125
{noformat}

It should be:

{noformat}
<method> def foo#7445(): scala#21.this.AnyRef#2222{type Bar#12153 <: scala#21.this.AnyRef#2222}#Bar#12123
{noformat}

I believe that this assumption is incorrect:

{code}
    // only need to rebind type aliases, as typeRef already handles abstract types
    // (they are allowed to be rebound more liberally)
    def coevolveSym(pre1: Type): Symbol = sym
{code}

Compare with the override in {{AliasTypeRef}}:

{code}
    // #3731: return sym1 for which holds: pre bound sym.name to sym and
    // pre1 now binds sym.name to sym1, conceptually exactly the same
    // symbol as sym.  The selection of sym on pre must be updated to the
    // selection of sym1 on pre1, since sym's info was probably updated
    // by the TypeMap to yield a new symbol, sym1 with transformed info.
    // @returns sym1
    override def coevolveSym(pre1: Type): Symbol =
      if (pre eq pre1) sym else (pre, pre1) match {
        // don't look at parents -- it would be an error to override alias types anyway
        case (RefinedType(_, _), RefinedType(_, decls1)) => decls1 lookup sym.name
        // TODO: is there another way a typeref's symbol can refer to a symbol defined in its pre?
        case _                                           => sym
      }
{code}

Part of the problem is existentialTransform's use of subst instead of substSym:

{code}
    def doSubst(info: Type) = info.substSym(rawSyms, typeParams) // don't use subst, as it won't update pre.sym[args]  to pre.newSym[args]  unless pre == NoPrefix!
{code}
Vaguely related problem:

{code}
scala> class Test {
     |   def c: x.X forSome { val x : {type X <: C}; type C } = ???
     |   lazy val x = c // lazy vals are borked when dealing with existentials
     | }
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : x.type(in lazy value x)#X(in <refinement of AnyRef>)(in <refinement of AnyRef>) where type x.type(in lazy value x) <: AnyRef{type X(in <refinement of AnyRef>)(in <refinement of AnyRef>) <: C} with Singleton

         lazy val x = c // lazy vals are borked when dealing with existentials
                      ^

         lazy val x = c // lazy vals are borked when dealing with existentials
                  ^

{code}
lazy vals are really an innocent victim, their mistake is using a var in the implementation.
Here is another, free of lazy vals.
{code}
class Test {
  val c: x.X forSome { val x : { type X <: AnyRef with C }; type C } = ???
}
{code}

That compiles if it's private\[this\], which is how you can tell it's the correspondence between getter and field. With vars it's even more booched thanks to the setter. See also the old comment of mine which retronym brought up in some other ticket recently.
{code}
    case class Getter(tree: ValDef) extends BaseGetter(tree) {
      override def derivedSym = if (mods.isDeferred) basisSym else basisSym.getter(enclClass)
      private def derivedRhs  = if (mods.isDeferred) EmptyTree else fieldSelection
      private def derivedTpt = {
        // For existentials, don't specify a type for the getter, even one derived
        // from the symbol! This leads to incompatible existentials for the field and
        // the getter. Let the typer do all the work. You might think "why only for
        // existentials, why not always," and you would be right, except: a single test
        // fails, but it looked like some work to deal with it. Test neg/t0606.scala
        // starts compiling (instead of failing like it's supposed to) because the typer
        // expects to be able to identify escaping locals in typedDefDef, and fails to
        // spot that brand of them. In other words it's an artifact of the implementation.
        val tpt = derivedSym.tpe_*.finalResultType.widen match {
          // Range position errors ensue if we don't duplicate this in some
          // circumstances (at least: concrete vals with existential types.)
          case ExistentialType(_, _)  => TypeTree() setOriginal (tree.tpt.duplicate setPos tree.tpt.pos.focus)
          case _ if mods.isDeferred   => TypeTree() setOriginal tree.tpt // keep type tree of original abstract field
          case tp                     => TypeTree(tp)
        }
        tpt setPos tree.tpt.pos.focus
      }
      override def derivedTree: DefDef = newDefDef(derivedSym, derivedRhs)(tpt = derivedTpt)
    }
{code}
I debugged it to subtyping for existentials being broken.

{code}
      val underlying1 = underlying.instantiateTypeParams(quantified, tvars) // fuse subst quantified -> quantifiedFresh -> tvars
{code}

does not go into symbol infos, thus the C in X's bound is not replaced by a type var
subtyping is broken because substitution is -- you can't tell, because existentialTransform transitively chases all bounds so it doesn't matter, but that's not the right fix (as that rewrite is not universally valid, and we shouldn't be changing these user-defined types like that anyway)

{code}
scala> type T = X forSome { type X <: U ; type U <: String }
scala> typeOf[T].dealias.skolemizeExistential.typeSymbol.info
res7: $r.intp.global.Type =  <: String
{code}

If you disable that bound rewriting (as I'm doing), this will yield false:
{code}
scala> :power
scala> class C { type T = X.T forSome { val X : U ; type U <: {type T} } }
scala> typeOf[C].member("T": TypeName)
scala> res0.info.skolemizeExistential <:< res0.info
{code}

the remainder of my saga turned out to be SI-2071, which I hope to fix in 2.12 (https://github.com/adriaanm/scala/compare/t2071
I'll submit a fix under -Xexperimental for RC2, a full fix is blocked by SI-2071, which won't make it into 2.11.0. Probably for 2.12.
