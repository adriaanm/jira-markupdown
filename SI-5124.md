The takeWhile method produces an Iterator which have border effect on the original one.

Possibly other methods which produce an Iterator have the same.

{code}
var i = List(1, 2, 3, 4).iterator.buffered
val j = i.takeWhile(_ < 3)
println(i.head)
println(i.head)
j.next()
println(i.head)
j.next()
println(i.head)

Produces:

1
1
2
3
{code}

This is maybe intended, as are some issue with takeWhile eating the next element (even in BufferedIterator -> use span instead). 

It is due that no clone() method are available, so the new Iterator has a direct reference to the first one, but still... should be documented!
