I wanted the definition of `equals`, `toString`, etc from case class, but I also wanted to insure that this object could be used as a unique key.

This class also depends on an implicit argument. When the compiler generates the apply method for the companion object, it conflicts with my custom version of the apply method.

```scala
object CaseClassOverload {

  class Format

  case class X private[CaseClassOverload] (unique: String)(implicit format: Format)

  object X {

    private var registered: Map[String, X] = Map()

    private[CaseClassOverload] def apply(unique: String)(implicit format: Format): X = {
      synchronized {
        require(!(registered contains unique), s"$unique already registered")
        val uniqueX = new X(unique)(format)
        registered += unique -> uniqueX
        uniqueX
      }
    }
  }

  val error = X("a")(new Format)  // compile error
}
```

```
scala> object CaseClassOverload {
     |
     |   class Format
     |
     |   case class X private[CaseClassOverload] (unique: String)(implicit format: Format)
     |
     |   object X {
     |
     |     private var registered: Map[String, X] = Map()
     |
     |     private[CaseClassOverload] def apply(unique: String)(implicit format: Format): X = {
     |       synchronized {
     |         require(!(registered contains unique), s"$unique already registered")
     |         val uniqueX = new X(unique)(format)
     |         registered += unique -> uniqueX
     |         uniqueX
     |       }
     |     }
     |   }
     |
     |   val error = X("a")(new Format)  // compile error
     | }
<console>:27: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,

```

I thought that the case class definition of apply would not be generated if my custom version had the same signature.
I got around it with:

```scala
object CaseClassOverload {

  class Format

  private var registered: Map[String, X] = Map()

  case class X private[CaseClassOverload] (unique: String)(implicit format: Format) {
    registered synchronized {
      require(!(registered contains unique), s"$unique already registered")
      registered += unique -> this
    }
  }

  val error = X("a")(new Format)
}
```

Probably a cleaner way to do it anyway.
It looks like this needs to be clarified in the spec first. Section [5.3.2](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/05-classes-and-objects.html#case-classes) only mentions:

```
If a companion object c exists already, no new object is created, but the apply and unapply methods are added to the existing object instead.
```

It does not define in which situations these methods are not generated.
The spec says make it abstract to disable `apply` generation.
```scala
scala> :pa
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

object CaseClassOverload {
  class Format
  abstract case class X private[CaseClassOverload] (
    unique: String)(implicit format: Format)
  object X {
    def apply(s: String)(implicit f: Format) =
      new X(s)(f) {}
  }
}

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined object CaseClassOverload

scala> CaseClassOverload.X("hi")(new CaseClassOverload.Format)
res2: CaseClassOverload.X = X(hi)

```
To me, it's strange because `copy` isn't added if the class already has a `copy` method.

I think it insists on case classes being very regular for purposes of rewriting `C()` to `new C()` and for pattern matching, which is the primary use case. Then it becomes tricky to communicate, "I want to do something funky." Without getting bogged down in annotations. 

I would have said returning an anonymous subclass clearly says that this result is somehow different from an ordinary X, namely due to the special factory.
My previous assumption that there are situations where a manually written `apply` can replace the auto-generated one seems to be wrong. That is tracked by #9547. In this case it looks like a simple bug, i.e. writing two methods that differ only in the presence of an implicit parameter is allowed, but writing one and having the other auto-generated causes an error.
