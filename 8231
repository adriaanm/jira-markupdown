Which removal are you referring to? The only part that I'm aware of is the deprecation of Manifest.<:<.

Manifest themselves are not deprecated:
```scala
// TODO undeprecated until Scala reflection becomes non-experimental
// @deprecated("Use scala.reflect.ClassTag (to capture erasures) or scala.reflect.runtime.universe.TypeTag (to capture types) or both instead", "2.10.0")
trait Manifest[T] extends ClassManifest[T] with Equals {
```
