The :: pattern only matches {{List}}; you are pattern matching on {{case class :: }}.

The compiler cannot statically rule out this pattern match, because all it has to go on is the static type of the scrutinee, {{Seq[Int]}}. The pattern can only match a {{List}}, which is a subtype of {{Seq}}, so the match may succeed.

Somewhat unintuitively, the {{Nil}} matches any empty {{Seq}}, by the same logic as:

{code}
scala> Vector() == Nil
res4: Boolean = true
{code}

You have two alternatives.

1) convert to a list first
2) use the :+ pattern.

{code}
scala>  Array[Int](0).toSeq match { case head :+ tail => "Non-empty"; case Nil => "Empty" }
res1: String = Non-empty
{code}
