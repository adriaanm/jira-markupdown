The syntax highlighting does not work properly. The specification seems to have a bug. Passing the character '|' (using single quotes) to methods causes problem in syntax highlighting.

The screenshot shows the problem. The line val z = "2" is in a different color than expected. 

The following oode can generate the problem.

{noformat}
def foo = {
	val x = "1"
	val y = bar('|')
	val z = "2"	
}

{noformat}

The problem seems to be with the file SCALA_HOME/misc/scala-tool-support/notepad-plus

Note: the issue is not "major" but it doesn't let me select anything else.
