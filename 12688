I see now that `Regex.quoteReplacement` can be used, as follows:

"""([^']+)'s""".r.replaceAllIn(token, m => Regex.quoteReplacement(m.group(1)))

However, this seems like a lot of work to do a common thing (replace based on a capture group).

The other situation, where someone *wants* to replace with a "$3" and then have that trigger a back-reference substitution, seems much rarer. 

I realize this is getting a little ranty. It was painful. Anyhow, I don't want to break backwards compatibility, but this does break the principle of least surprise.
