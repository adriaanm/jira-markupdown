Correction of typo :

Introduction of 'capacity' seems not to be a problem.

My main concern is about the way 'size' will behave.

What does size return if client don't store elements continuously in the array ?
Do we ignore the 'holes' ?
Do we stop counting once first null appears ?
If we ignore null elements, that would mean (IMO) that storing null in a Array is not meaningful. So we are adding a little be semantic to Array collection. Is that what we want ?
