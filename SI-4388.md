The following program compiles with no warnings, then throws a CCE when run.

{code}
import scala.math.Ordering;
import scala.math.Ordering$;

public class J {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Here's where we are really punished...
    // Again I see the generation of a Character method
    // as the only way out.
    Ordering<Object> charOrd = Ordering.Char$.MODULE$;
    
    charOrd.compare(new Object(), new Object());
  }
}
{code}
{code}

In 2.8.1 it fails to compile in the desirable way, because Ordering.Char is an Ordering<Character>.
(Note that 2.8.1 requires a slightly different code because of changes to the InnerClasses attribute)
{code}
// 2.8 only

    // Again I see the generation of a Character method

    Ordering<Object> charOrd = Ordering$Char$.MODULE$;
    
    charOrd.compare(new Object(), new Object());
  }

But that was changed in an attempt to fix SI-4214, as explained in the commit message for r24363:
{code}
Another lap around the track with generic signatures.
At the root of the issue reported in SI-4214 is our old friend
(fondly remembered from the days of primitive equality)
boxed/primitive unification.

  // scala
  trait T[A] {
    def f(): A
  }
  // the generic signature spec doesn't allow for parameterizing
  // on primitive types, so this cannot remain Char.  However
  // translating it to Character, as was done, also has issues.
  class C extends T[Char] {
    def f(): Char = 'a'
  }

  // Note that neither of the signatures for f, the implementation
  // or the bridge method, matches the type parameter.
  Generic interfaces in class:
    T<java.lang.Character>
  Generic signatures:
    public char C.f()
    public java.lang.Object C.f()

After this commit, primitive type parameters are translated into
Object instead of the boxed type.  It was martin's idea, so no review.
Closes SI-4214.

Again I see no way out which does not involve generating more bridge methods which put things in boxes and take things out of other boxes.
I see. But I think we are almost there. I believe that instead of representing

T[Char] as T<java.lang.Character> or T<Object>, which are both unsound, we should simply represent it as the raw type T.

I'm so accustomed to shunning raw types, I hadn't considered it.  You may be right.
