Of unknown relevance, but note this comment I placed at some distantly remembered time in computePluginPhases.
```scala
  lazy val plugins: List[Plugin] = loadPlugins
  // ...
  protected def computePluginPhases(): Unit = {
    // For reasons not yet apparent to me, plugins started appearing
    // as null when I added phaseTimings to global.
    if (plugins != null)
      phasesSet ++= (plugins flatMap (_.components))
  }
```
Since plugins is a lazy val it probably shouldn't be appearing as null.  Also note that if I override a different randomly chosen method in similar fashion, it doesn't crash.  So this manifestation of the issue may depend on what exactly this method is doing.
