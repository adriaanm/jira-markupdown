Following code won't compile:
```scala
class A {
  protected def foo = 45
}

class B extends A {
  foo

}

object B {
  val a: A = new A
  a.foo
}
```
But in spec declared: The protected modifier applies to class member definitions. Protected members
of a class can be accessed from within
– the template of the defining class,
– all templates that have the defining class as a base class,
– the companionmodule of any of those classes.
So in this case there must be access to def foo.
