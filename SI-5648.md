The result make the warning obviously wrong:

scala> case class C(val s: Int*)
defined class C

scala> new C(1, 3, 7) == new C(1, 3, 7)
<console>:10: warning: comparing a fresh object using `==' will always yield false
              new C(1, 3, 7) == new C(1, 3, 7)
                             ^
res4: Boolean = true

That depends on your definition of obviously.

As Paul said previously: "A warning might be possible, but it's harder than it looks to warn where you want to without creating spurious warnings elsewhere."

The bug is due to handling case class comparisons like Some.  A simpler example:
{code}
scala> new Some(1) == Some(1)
<console>:8: warning: comparing a fresh object using `==' will always yield false
              new Some(1) == Some(1)
                          ^
res1: Boolean = true
{code}

I can request a pull with a tweak, after I check all the spurious warnings elsewhere, obviously.

I already pushed a fix for this, but it can be improved.  Also, the world of name mangling bugs became more interesting recently with SI-5652, if you didn't see that one.
