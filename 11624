Others may feel differently, but I am not yet convinced that this addition to the library is desirable.

Upsides:
  * convenient early termination in for comprehensions
  * complements breakable/break in that it works with yield

Downsides:
  * fragile syntax (perhaps at least partially fixable)
  * more ways to do the same thing (learning / maintenance cost goes up)
  * more boilerplate than existing ways to do it

It may be just the thing for some users, which argues for it being part of *some* library, but not necessarily the standard library.
