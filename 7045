I support {{as}} as a replacement of {{convert}} since it has very close semantics and is really succinct. I don't support {{pipe}} since its semantics are coarse and misleading. {{ap}} and {{app}} are abbreviations and I don't remember any abbreviations being used in the standard library. Semantics of {{be}} are too broad.

Actually I came up with {{as}} on my own and now that I see that Rex has already posted it I support his suggestion twice as much )
