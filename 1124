First, I want to thank you for implementing this feature!

I tried it already and it worked fine in my first test case. But there's still an open issue. Consider the following classes:

 * ScalaSeqInterface.java
{code}
public interface ScalaSeqInterface {
  public String f(String... seq);
}
{code}
 * ScalaSeq.scala
{code}
class ScalaSeq extends ScalaSeqInterface {
  def f(seq: String*): String = "asdf"
}
{code}
 * ScalaSeqTest.java
{code}
public class ScalaSeqTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(((ScalaSeqInterface) new ScalaSeq()).f(""));  // compiles
    System.out.println(new ScalaSeq().f(""));                        // does not compile
  }
}
{code}

Why can't I use {{new ScalaSeq().f("")}} in a Java class? Why do I have to cast the Scala class first?

PS: But since there's a workaround (via casting) for this problem, there might be more urgent issues at the moment.
