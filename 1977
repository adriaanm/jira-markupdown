I also ran into this while working on scala/bug#6493.

This does not typecheck:
```scala
class Test {
  val c: x forSome { type x <: {type X <: C}; type C } = ???
}
```

I traced it to failing to solve the type vars in withTypeVars when multiple type vars must be related. There's a kind of backstop in existentialTransform that chases these bounds transitively, which kind of works but creates other problems. I'd like to get rid of the backstop and fix subtyping of existentials instead.
