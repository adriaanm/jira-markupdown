When comparing two values of type {{Unit}} with {{==}} the compiler warns that said comparison will always yield {{true}}. However, this is not the case when exactly one of the arguments is {{null}}:

{noformat}
scala> null.asInstanceOf[Unit] == {}
<console>:8: warning: comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true
              null.asInstanceOf[Unit] == {}
                                      ^
res0: Boolean = false
{noformat}
{{null.asInstanceOf[Unit]}} is the lie. The only Unit value is the Unit value. And that is what that expression nominally evaluates to.

But SI-602 is the canonical issue and SI-4572 turns up the same alley with Unit. BoxedUnit is like the wrapped gifts under the tree at the mall. Nobody ever unboxes them, not even to check for a lump of coal.
