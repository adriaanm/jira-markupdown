When I define secondary constructors with default parameters, if two parameters share the same type it gives me a "double definition" error. Below is the offending code:

```scala
case class Person(name: String = "", address: String = "") {
  def this(p: Person, name: String = null, address: String = null) = this(
    if(name == null) p.name else name,
    if(address == null) p.address else address
  )
}
```

Error:

```scala
Person.scala:2: error: double definition:
method <init>$default$2:=> String and
method <init>$default$2:=> String at line 1
have same type
  def this(p: Person, name: String = null, address: String = null) = this(
                      ^
one error found
```
It should issue the same implementation restriction as:

```
scala> class C { def foo(a: Int = 0) = 0; def foo(a: Int = 0, b: Any) = 0 }
<console>:7: error: in class C, multiple overloaded alternatives of method foo define default arguments.
       class C { def foo(a: Int = 0) = 0; def foo(a: Int = 0, b: Any) = 0 }
             ^
```
But it doesn't:

```scala
class Foo(a: Int = 0) { 
  def this(a: String = "0") = this(a.toInt)
}
```

Furthermore, these snippets compiles too:

```scala
class Foo(a: String = "0") { def this(p1: String, p2: Int = 0) = this(p1 + p2.toString) }

class Foo(val a: String = "0") { 
  def this(p1: String, p2: String = "0") = this(p1 + p2.toString)
}
```

In these two examples above, I have constructors with default parameters, and Scala can inflect which one I want (even in the second case, when it's not really clear if I do `new Foo("A String")` if it should call the primary or the secondary).

In the ticket's example, it's clear that the secondary constructor is not "ambiguous" nor "double defined", as the first parameter it expects is a mandatory one AND has no default parameter.
If you have overloads of `f` in a class, only one of them may use define defaults:

```scala
scala> class C { def foo(a: Int = 0, b: Int = 0) = 0; def foo(a: String = "") = 0 }
<console>:7: error: in class C, multiple overloaded alternatives of method foo define default arguments.
       class C { def foo(a: Int = 0, b: Int = 0) = 0; def foo(a: String = "") = 0 }
             ^
```

This check wasn't working for constructors. My change brings them under the same rules as regular methods.

```scala
scala> class C { def this(a: Int = 0, b: Int = 0) = this(); def this(a: String = "") = this() }
<console>:7: error: in class C, multiple overloaded alternatives of constructor C define default arguments.
       class C { def this(a: Int = 0, b: Int = 0) = this(); def this(a: String = "") = this() }
             ^
```
Although I like the consistency of treating constructors as regular methods, I would prefer another correction in place of restricting even more methods (or, in this case, constructors) with default arguments. For instance, in C++ I can create multiple methods with default arguments if the language is able to distinguish one from another:

```scala
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Foo {
    public:
    void foo(int foo = 10, int bar = 20) {
        cout << "First method\n";
    }
    
    void foo(string foo, int bar = 20) {
        cout << "Second method\n";
    }
};

int main(void) {
    Foo f = Foo();
    f.foo(10);  //Prints "First method"
    f.foo("String"); //Prints "Second method"
}
```

In Scala, as I have shown in my examples, this is almost working except that for some cases it detects double definitions. Is it possible to try to correct these double definitions, in place of putting even more restrictions over constructors?

(Sorry for the trouble, but working in Scala it seems cumbersome to work with constructors the way it is implemented today, comparing it with another languages, that I don't think implementing even more restrictions is quite the way to go...)

I also did a double-take. The rule is to prefer the application that doesn't require default args, which seems to be a robust rule in the face of this issue.
