I've used a long for comprehension to extract sub nodes from an xml node, I wanted an automatic failure if a tag is missing.
```scala
  for( a <- (xml \\ "tag1") map fa;
       b <- (xml \\ "tag2") map fb;
       ...)
   yield new X(a,b..)
```
I changed this by folding a Some(new X) into a list of updater functions{{ ( X => Option[Unit] ) }} using the operation `(optX,f) => for(x <- optX; ok <- f(x)) yield x`.

Maybe there's a better way to handle this.
