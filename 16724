The core loop of the MurmurHash3 algorithm has been changed from what we have in the Scala codebase.  Although the new version is less stateful and is faster with C++, I do not see a compelling reason to switch the algorithm at this point.  However, if we are ever going to, doing so with a major release is probably the time to do it.

I am willing to make the changes if they are desired.

If we want to add the (new) 64 bit and 128 bit versions so we have them in the library for people who need >32 bit keys, I am willing to do those also.
