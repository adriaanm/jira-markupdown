Consider the following code:
```scala
(1 to 10).toList.maxBy(xâ‡’{
  Thread.sleep(1000) // heavy computation here
  println("Evaluate the ordering of " + x)
  x
})
```

This code will evaluate measure function 18 times instead of 10 times.
It will cause performance penalty if the function is heavy.
