I really don't think that's the case. Every mutable map companion should inherit `MutableMapFactory`. The below override in that class prevents the situation you've described from happening.

{code}
  /** The default builder for $Coll objects.
   *  @tparam A      the type of the keys
   *  @tparam B      the type of the associated values
   */
  override def newBuilder[A, B]: Builder[(A, B), CC[A, B]] = empty[A, B]
{code}

Could you post the exact code snippet which resolves to the incorrect builder?
