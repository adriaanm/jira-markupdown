I've been working a little with the package objects in 2.8, and I've found a little oddity.  Say you've got a package with a package object:
{code}
package com.rojoma

package object pkg {
  implicit def enrich(a: A) = new RichA(a)
}
{code}
If you're _outside_ the package, all works as expected:
{code}
import com.rojoma.pkg._
(new A).someRichAMethod() // finds the implicit, great
{code}
But if you're _inside_ it, you still have to explicitly import the package's contents for the implicits to be found:
{code}
package com.rojoma.pkg

class Cls {
  // doesn't find the implicit unless com.rojoma.pkg._ is imported
  (new A).someRichAMethod()
}
{code}
The `enrich` method is in scope; calling it explicitly works.  It's just not found by the implicit-resolution machinery.

For completeness, the same thing happens if the code that wants to use the implicit is in a package nested inside "com.rojoma.pkg".
