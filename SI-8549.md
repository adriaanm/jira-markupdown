Compiling this code:
```scala
package test

@SerialVersionUID(1)
class Ser extends Serializable
```

using 2.10 and then running the following:
```scala
object Main extends App {
  println( classOf[test.Ser].getDeclaredField("serialVersionUID") )
}
```
Will print `public static final long test.Ser.serialVersionUID`

However, compiling the same with 2.11 gives a NoSuchFIeldException
I can see that this has affected scala library classes as well. This is a terrrible regression!

Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).

scala> Nil.getClass.getDeclaredField("serialVersionUID").get(null)

But with 2.11

Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_45).

For what it's worth it has previously been decreed that "binary compatibility does not cover serialization" in #5697.
Also it would appear https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1673 was intended to fix #6988 but that ticket is still open. Actually no, the commit is Nov 2012 but the ticket was opened in Jan 2013.
