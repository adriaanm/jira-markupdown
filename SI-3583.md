From Typers:
{code}
/** Try packing all arguments into a Tuple and apply `fun'
           *  to that. This is the last thing which is tried (after
           *  default arguments)
           */
{code}

I couldn't find this in the spec.
While we're at it, we could make this safer by:
 * warning if auto tupling chooses one of overloaded alternatives
 * warning if any auto-tupling occurs if -Xwarn-auto-tupling is specified.

{code}
[11:13pm] paulp: So I change from one joda time class with a 7-arg constructor to a similar one with fewer.
[11:13pm] paulp: but in addition to not having a 7-arg constructor, it has one which takes Object.
[11:14pm] paulp: so no warning until runtime failure "what the <expletive deleted> is a 7-tuple?" says joda time.
[11:14pm] paulp: that is an absolute debacle. 
[11:14pm] paulp: I knew about this issue but it never bit me this ugly before.
[11:16pm] retronym: -Xwarn-auto-tupling would be popular, from my straw polls
[11:19pm] retronym: paulp: or just outright disable it if there are overloaded alternatives
{code}
