I think you're hitting the natural ceiling on the "copy and mutate" approach to coherence. These constructs are too complex and too poorly managed to tolerate an ad hoc copy-on-demand approach to maintaining different views of the same type. Imagine if you will:
{code}
@immutable abstract class Type
@immutable abstract class Prefix extends Type
@immutable final case class TypeView(seenFrom: Prefix, tpe: Type) extends Type
{code}
Until such a day arrives, everyone should be thankful for whatever scraps of correctness they can scavenge. I'll certainly be glad to get these particular scraps. I thank you for the effort, while simultaneously regretting the percentage of it which goes to the chase-the-mutable monkey gods for whom no sacrifice will ever be enough.
