Having just written this email, I am led to wonder if there's some reason we can't just lift classes and objects out of the package object into the package.
```scala
Don't put objects and classes in package objects.  It kind of works
sometimes, but it exposes you to these corner cases, and for no
gain: the best case is that it works like it would have if you'd
just put the objects/classes in the package.

Like this.

package object PkgObj {
       def hi(s: String) = s
}
package PkgObj {
  object App extends Application {
          println(hi("hello,world"))
  }
}

If you look at what is generated the way you had it you will see
why there is a problem.  To run a program the bytecode has to be
where it's supposed to be, no tricks.

ls -l PkgObj/
total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  wheel   498 Mar 16 09:31 package$$.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  wheel  1076 Mar 16 09:31 package$$App$$.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  wheel   683 Mar 16 09:31 package.class
```
