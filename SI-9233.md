If calling a generic function, the parameter type(s) of which equal a nested type of a type parameter, the compiler fails with a type error at the call site, even when said nested type's exact value could be deduced.

```scala
trait A[T0] {
 type Te = T0
}

class Ai extends A[Int]

def f[T <: A[_]](p : T#Te) = ???

f[Ai](5)
```
```
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(5)
 required: _$1
              f[Ai](5)
                    ^
```
In your example, when typechecking the type of the parameter of `p`, the compiler can only use the existential `_$1` (the existential from the declared upper bound). When you instantiate the method type with `T=Ai`, nothing can be substituted into that type.

In order to infer that `T=Int`, you would need to expose it as a type parameter. For example:

```scala
def f1[T](p: A[T])(f: p.Te) = ???
f1(new Ai)(5)
```
