Take the disassembly of `scala.collection.mutable.StringBuilder.getLength` as an example:

{code}
public void setLength(int);
 Code:
  0:   iload_1
  1:   iconst_0
  2:   if_icmplt       9
  5:   iconst_1
  6:   goto    10
  9:   iconst_0
  10:  new     SI-478; //class
scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder$$$$anonfun$$setLength$$1
  13:  dup
  14:  pop
  15:  aload_0
  16:  iload_1
  17:  invokespecial   SI-481; //Method
scala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder$$$$anonfun$$setLength$$1."<init>":(Lscala/collection/mutable/StringBuilder;I)V
...
{code}

The `new` ~ `dup` ~ `pop` ~ ... ~ `invokespecial` sequence is a hint that something's going wrong, because after `invokespecial` the newly created instance can't be accessed at all.

The closure class (and its instantiation) isn't needed any more because it was completely inlined into the method in question.
I attached a patch which declares constructors of anonymous functions as pure and thus, allows their removal.

Is this a sound approach? A all anonymous function constructors free of side-effects?

Another thing: Probably, the line
{code}
|| (sym.isConstructor && inliner.isClosureClass(sym.owner))
{code}
should have had the effect my patch now has. BUT: 
 1. This apparently does not work
 2. If it would work, it would be dangerous because general function classes could have some side-effects in their constructor.

Someone should review what is going on there...

I think the synthetic check takes care of that.  
{code}
  def isClosureClass(cls: Symbol): Boolean = {
    val res = cls.isFinal && cls.hasFlag(Flags.SYNTHETIC) && !cls.isModuleClass &&
        cls.tpe.parents.exists { t => 
          val TypeRef(_, sym, _) = t;
          definitions.FunctionClass exists sym.==
        }
    res
  }
{code}
There's another very similar but different version of the same function in CopyPropagation, which is probably a bad sign.
{code}
    final def isClosureClass(cls: Symbol): Boolean = 
        cls.isFinal &&
        cls.tpe.parents.exists { t => 
          val TypeRef(_, sym, _) = t;
          definitions.FunctionClass exists sym.==
        }
{code}
(In r20598) Fixed isClosureClass in inliner and removed it from CopyPropagation (was dead code). See SI-2893.
