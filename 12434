A compile-time error would be nice.

The following bit does not compile (on 2.11.8):
```scala
Set(1,2,3) match {
  case Nil => "oops"
  case x :: xs => "ok"
}
```

Whereas the following works just fine:
```scala
Iterable(1,2,3) match {
  case Nil => "oops"
  case x :: xs => "ok"
}
```

Since `m.keys` produces an `Iterable` I would either expect it to compile and run fine or say at compile time that it's not possible because a `Set` is used in the background and sets don't allow `Cons`. 

I'm not sure this if feasible (or desired) really. I'm just saying that `Set` and `Iterable` produce results I expect but with the `Map.keys` method the results are not as clear cut (unless I'm missing something fundamental here) even though as a user I should not be too fazed about the implementation in the background.
