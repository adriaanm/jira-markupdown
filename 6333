A {{GenASM}}-based candidate solution can be found at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/654 

The corresponding {{GenJVM}} fix would look almost identical, provided fjbg could emit a static field along with its initial value (otherwise, all sorts of control-flow contortions are needed).

A question for [~dragos]: is it really the case that fjbg can't emit the initial value of a static field?
