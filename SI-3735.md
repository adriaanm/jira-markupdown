If I have the following scaladoc comment

```scala
/** Does a whole lot of things
 * that are very necessary.
 */
```

The resulting doc string is

Does a whole lot of thingsthat are very necessary.

This should be

Does a whole lot of things that are very necessary.


This can be avoided by adding a trailing space or a leading space, however this is somewhat counterintuitive, and trailing spaces have a tendency to get removed by some editors.

 * Scala Version: 22674
 * Java Version: 
```scala
java version "1.6.0_20"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.3-b01-279, mixed mode)
```
 * OS: OS X 10.6.3

The easiest way to see this is to open up any Scala library source file, find a sentence that spans two lines and remove all trailing spaces from the first line.
Slight correction: this seems to occur only when the item on the next line has markup or there is markup at the end of the line.  Here is a better example (can't edit the ticket to update)

```scala

 /** Returns a $$some containing the result of
   * applying `pf` to this $$option's contained
   * value, *if*
   * this option is 
   * nonempty 
   * *and* `pf` is defined for that value. 
   * Returns $$none otherwise. 
```

This renders as:

> Returns a Some containing the result of applying pf to this Option 's contained value, ifthis option is nonemptyand pf is defined for that value. Returns None otherwise.

notice "ifthis" and "nonemptyand"; these should "if this" and "nonempty and"

The generated HTML is:
```scala
<p class="shortcomment cmt">Returns a <a href="Some.html" class="extype" name="scala.Some">Some</a>  containing the result of
applying <code>pf</code> to this <a href="" class="extype" name="scala.Option">Option</a> 's contained
value, <b>if</b>this option is
nonempty<b>and</b> <code>pf</code> is defined for that value.</p> 
```
I think this ticket is duplicate of #3541.
(In r24191) [scaladoc] Fixes the way new lines in wiki syntax convert to spaces. Closes #3735. No review.
