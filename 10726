It's to do with the `hashCode`:
```scala
$ scala -Ywarn-numeric-widen

scala> case class A(b: Short) { override def hashCode: Int = 0 }
defined class A

The default `hashCode` doesn't seem to be bad, though:
```scala
override <synthetic> def hashCode(): Int = {
  <synthetic> var acc: Int = -889275714;
  acc = Statics.this.mix(acc, b.toInt);
  Statics.this.finalizeHash(acc, 1)
};
```
