on Mac 10.6.2 (Java build 1.6.0_17-b04-248-10M3025, Scala code runner version 2.8.0.r20371-b20100106020130) following message appears when debugging begins:

"Exception processing async thread queue" and multiple "JDI thread evaluations" inside the list.
Do you have a watchpoint enabled? On "arr"? (I'm guessing that you're working with the same code sample as in SI-2990).

If that's the case, could you try removing all watchpoints and let me know if you still get the JDI error.
yes, I test it exactly on a code shown in screenshot. 

I disabled breakpoint and now debug starts without these JDI exceptions. 
Btw. have you also noticed that this issue is very simmilar to one raised by me today (SI-2990 String index out of range)?

In both cases IDE complains about String index out of bound, maybe this is same cause?
