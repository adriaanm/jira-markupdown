/*My English is not so good, forgive my expression */
The iterator method of Stream is defined in LinearSeqLike now. I think it should be override in class Stream to make it more lazy.
In my opinion, it should be something like following:
```scala
class Stream[A] {
   ...
  class LazyCell[T](st: => Stream[T]){ lazy val v = st }
  
  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
    var these = new LazyCell(Stream.this)
    def hasNext: Boolean = !these.v.isEmpty
    def next: A = 
      if (hasNext) {
        val result = these.v.head; 
        these =new LazyCell(these.v.tail); 
	result
      } else Iterator.empty.next
    override def toList: List[A] = stream.toList
  }
}
```
I discovered this ticket during the time when I try to fix #2634.
I have spend a couple of hours try to find why my solution which mentioned in #3265 didn't work. It confused my very much. I still don't know the reason, but I find something interested. 
In the following code, we can only get a StackOverflowError if using 
{code}
val fib: Stream[Int] = 1 #:: 1 #:: (fib, fib.tail).zippedx2.map(_ + _)
{code}.
We can get fib(2) and a StackOverflowError if using 
```scala
val fib: Stream[Int] = 1 #:: 1 #:: (fib, fib.tail).zippedx.map(_ + _)
```
While I expected to get fib(3) without any exception. I must have something missed. Is there any one to tell me why. I believe it is the key to fix #3273

```scala
import scala.collection.{TraversableLike, IterableLike}
import scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom

class LazyItrSt[A](stream: Stream[A]) {

  class LazyCell[T](st: => Stream[T]){ lazy val v = st }
  
  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
    var these = new LazyCell(stream)
    def hasNext: Boolean = !these.v.isEmpty
    def next: A = 
      if (hasNext) {
        val result = these.v.head; 
		these =new LazyCell(these.v.tail); 
		result
      } else Iterator.empty.next
    override def toList: List[A] = stream.toList
  }
}

class Zippedx[+Repr1, +El1, +Repr2, +El2](coll1: TraversableLike[El1, Repr1], coll2: IterableLike[El2, Repr2]) { 
    def map[B, To](f: (El1, El2) => B)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[Repr1, B, To]): To = {
      val elems2 = (new LazyItrSt(coll2.asInstanceOf[Stream[El2]])).iterator

      for(el1 <- coll1 if elems2.hasNext) yield f(el1, elems2.next)
    }
}

class Zippedx2[+Repr1, +El1, +Repr2, +El2](coll1: TraversableLike[El1, Repr1], coll2: IterableLike[El2, Repr2]) { 
    def map[B, To](f: (El1, El2) => B)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[Repr1, B, To]): To = {
      val elems2 = coll2.iterator

      for(el1 <- coll1 if elems2.hasNext) yield f(el1, elems2.next)
    }
}

object Debug extends Application {
    implicit def t2t[T1,T2](t: (T1,T2)) = new {
        def zippedx[Repr1, El1, Repr2, El2](implicit w1: T1 => TraversableLike[El1, Repr1],
                                                  w2: T2 => IterableLike[El2, Repr2]): Zippedx[Repr1, El1, Repr2, El2]
            = new Zippedx[Repr1, El1, Repr2, El2](t._1, t._2)
    }
	
	implicit def t2t2[T1,T2](t: (T1,T2)) = new {
        def zippedx2[Repr1, El1, Repr2, El2](implicit w1: T1 => TraversableLike[El1, Repr1],
                                                  w2: T2 => IterableLike[El2, Repr2]): Zippedx2[Repr1, El1, Repr2, El2]
            = new Zippedx2[Repr1, El1, Repr2, El2](t._1, t._2)
    }
	val fib: Stream[Int] = 1 #:: 1 #:: (fib, fib.tail).zippedx2.map(_ + _)
        //val fib: Stream[Int] = 1 #:: 1 #:: (fib, fib.tail).zippedx.map(_ + _)
	println(fib(2))
	println(fib(3))
}

Haha, I finaly find the reason !!!
The implementation of Stream#iterator is wrong which I showed above.
There is the correct one:

```scala
class Stream[A] {
   ...
  class LazyCell[T](st: => Stream[T]){ lazy val v = st }
  
  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
    var these = new LazyCell(Stream.this)
    def hasNext: Boolean = !these.v.isEmpty
    def next: A = 
        if (hasNext) {
            val result = these.v.head
            val tmp = these      //Here...
            these =new LazyCell(tmp.v.tail); 
	    result
        } else Iterator.empty.next
    override def toList: List[A] = Stream.this.toList
  }
}
```
Replying to [comment:5 extempore]:
> I applaud your progress, but so far in my limited fiddling with your implementation I haven't gotten zipped to behave fully lazily.  I can't spend any more time on it, but it would be great if you could take this all the way to a patch against trunk.  (I can't guarantee it'll go into 2.8 though.)

It works fine in my tests.
However, I don't satisfied with this way to fix #2634 since it is not perfect at all(as I mentioned in [http://old.nabble.com/Some-ideas-of-lazy-version-takeWhile-method-in-TraversableLike.-td28189940.html]).
In my opinion, just keep the status of #2634 until we have a pefect solution.

Anyway, this ticket(SI-3273) should be fixed
```scala
  override /*LinearSeqLike*/ 
  def iterator: Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
  
    class LazyCell(st: => Stream[A]){ lazy val v = st }
    
    var these = new LazyCell(self)
    def hasNext: Boolean = !these.v.isEmpty
    def next: A = 
      if (hasNext) {
        val cur = these.v
        val result = cur.head
        these = new LazyCell(cur.tail)
        result
      } else Iterator.empty.next
    override def toStream: Stream[A] = these.v
    override def toList: List[A] = these.v.toList
    
  }
```

this discussion is difficult to follow. Eastsun proposes a fix, but what bug does it fix? I'm not clear on why this is a separate ticket from #2634.

is there something short I can type into the REPL to see for myself that Stream.iterator needs to be "more lazy"?

And with lazy iterator:

scala> def lazyItr[A](xs: Stream[A]): Iterator[A] = new Iterator[A] {
     |
     |     class LazyCell(st: => Stream[A]){ lazy val v = st }
     |
     |     var these = new LazyCell(xs)
     |     def hasNext: Boolean = !these.v.isEmpty
     |     def next: A =
     |       if (hasNext) {
     |         val cur = these.v
     |         val result = cur.head
     |         these = new LazyCell(cur.tail)
     |         result
     |       } else Iterator.empty.next
     | }
lazyItr: [A](xs: Stream[A])Iterator[A]

scala> val num3: Stream[Int] = 1 #:: lazyItr(num3).map{ _+1 }.toStream
num1: Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> num3.take(10).toList
res0: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
```

(In r22995) Stream gets a specialized, extra-lazy Iterator so it can iterate
as lazily as it traverses.  Patch submitted by "Eastsun": probably
not his real name, but that's what we call him.  Closes #3273,
review by prokopec.
Is there anyone interested in #3526 ?
I think it's time to fix it.

In case you're not on the list, see my comments at http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.internals/3890 .  (Further discussion at #3526 please.)
