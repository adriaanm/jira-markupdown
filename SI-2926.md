The presentation compiler seems to have issues when an object is defined with the same name as a case class.

Steps to reproduce:

(1) Create a file Foo.scala:

```scala
package test

object Foo {
  
}
case class Foo(t: String) {

}
```

(2) Open editor

(3) Notice that the editor shows two incorrect errors (construction definition not allowed here and constructor Foo is defined twice).

The file is actually compiled fine and nothing is shown in the Problems view. scalac also handles the file fine:

```scala
/opt/scala-2.8.0.Beta1-RC8/bin/scalac test/Foo.scala
```
(In r20625) Attempt to fix #2926 (companion object of case class problem in Eclipse)
(In r20634) Second attempt to fix #2926. Reverted first attempt. review by milessabin.
This looks very, very good (and fixes a lot of the residual case of #2767 as well).

Unfortunately tweaking the example slightly gets the originally reported error back,

```scala
package test

object Foo2 {
  object Foo {
  
  }
  case class Foo(t: String) {

  }
}
```
