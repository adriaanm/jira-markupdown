@VladUreche, it would be great if you could minimize this bug. Doing so doesn't require GenASM knowledge, but looking for the code pattern that triggers a `VerifyError` under `-target:jvm-1.6`. The before and after code to compare involves `-Yinline-handlers` only, no other optimization phase changes the verification-error outcome.
