OK, I will see about reproducing it.  It came up somewhere in the course of either my tab completion code or the Interpreter.breakIf pretend-debugger code, both of which rely on being able to glean information via reflection without crashing.  It was intrusive enough to cause me to shelve whichever of those I was working on... if I can't reproduce it I'm going to staple a note to my forehead which says "RECORD ALL BUG DETAILS."
