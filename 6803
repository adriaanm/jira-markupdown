Can't we just get rid of the whole class and think about a better way to provide this functionality?

This class has been bug-ridden since I started to work with Scala and has a highly disproportional ratio of LOC/bugs. It is not even used in Scala at all except one occurrence in Scala Swing afaik.

Most code in the wild doesn't even bother using it and takes the expensive route of 

{code}
abstract class Foo
object Foo1 
object Foo2
... 
{code}

instead.

I don't have any hopes left that this functionality doesn't keep breaking like it did in the past.

Maybe it would be better to tell people to define enums in Java instead (as it is already done for runtime-visible annotations) and deprecate/remove this class?
