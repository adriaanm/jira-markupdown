Now that I see spec changes I guess I should open a ticket for the absence of fresh specifications.

Has not had new scala references for a while.
This seems to be a genuine bug in Ghostscript: the problem disappears removing the lines between {{begin}} and {{end}} in the following section (lines 8394 to 8399 as of r24170):
{code}
\begin{lstlisting}
  Byte    <-> java.lang.Byte
  Short   <-> java.lang.Short
  Char    <-> java.lang.Character
  Int     <-> java.lang.Integer
  Long    <-> java.lang.Long
  Float   <-> java.lang.Float
  Double  <-> java.lang.Double
  Boolean <-> java.lang.Boolean
\end{lstlisting}
{code}
The issue reappears again if at least two non-empty lines of text (any text) are inserted between the {{begin}} and {{end}}. I will ask Fabien to try Ghostscript 9.00, we'll see whether there's any improvement.
Correction, lines 8394 to 9399 are:
{code}
\begin{lstlisting}
  Byte  -> Short
  Short -> Int
  Char  -> Int
  Int   -> Long
  Long  -> Float
  Float -> Double
\end{lstlisting}
{code}
The issue is as described above.
(In r24193) Ugly workaround to address a LaTeX issue introduced in r23753.

Failure in the sense that TeX gets confused for reasons unknown.
See SI-4208 for further information.

(In r24195) Slightly better looking ugly workaround, see SI-4208.


It looks like a bug that occurs when a listing crosses a page break. There's nothing special about the listing itself, and if I put a \clearpage before it, the thing builds fine. Give that, the least bad thing to do right now might be to put a \clearpage before any listing that has the problem. Additionally, for longer listings, it might be better to put them inside a float so that they won't possibly cross a page boundary.

To prevent people from following a dead end, I can also add that surrounding the listing with \begin{samepage}...\end{samepage} didn't fix the problem.


The ideal fix would be in the Listings package itself. I don't have time right now to look into that, but perhaps someone else does. Also, I'll email Brooks Moses, the most recent maintainer I can find for the Listings package, and include a link to this bug report and minified sample file.
