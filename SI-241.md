In the specification, a function type with by-value paramters is defined as such:

```scala
Type ::= ‘(’ [‘=>’ Type] ‘)’ ‘=>’ Type
       | ...
```

In practice, the compiler accepts types such as:

```scala
(=>int, =>int) => int
```

It is a bit tricky to have the specification fit the implementation properly because the grammar for a non-by-value parameter list is part of `SimpleType` (and shares a production with tuple types):

```scala
SimpleType ::= ‘(’ Types [‘,’] ’)’
            | ...
```

Wich means the by-value marker `=>` cannot be added there.

It isn't pretty, but the rule for Type may be changed to:

```scala
Type ::= ‘(’ [‘=>’ Type {‘,’ [‘=>’] Type}] ‘)’ ‘=>’ Type
       | ...
```
