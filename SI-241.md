In the specification, a function type with by-value paramters is defined as such:

{code}
Type ::= ‘(’ [‘=>’ Type] ‘)’ ‘=>’ Type
       | ...
{code}

In practice, the compiler accepts types such as:

{code}
(=>int, =>int) => int
{code}

It is a bit tricky to have the specification fit the implementation properly because the grammar for a non-by-value parameter list is part of `SimpleType` (and shares a production with tuple types):

{code}
SimpleType ::= ‘(’ Types [‘,’] ’)’
            | ...
{code}

Wich means the by-value marker `=>` cannot be added there.

It isn't pretty, but the rule for Type may be changed to:

{code}
Type ::= ‘(’ [‘=>’ Type {‘,’ [‘=>’] Type}] ‘)’ ‘=>’ Type
       | ...
{code}
