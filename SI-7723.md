Trying to come up with a pattern to match creation of anonymous inner classes, I ended with:

```java

case b@q"""new $tpe[..$tparams](...$vparamss) { ..$body }""" => println("b: " + b); tpe
case a@q"""new $tpe(...$vparamss) { ..$body }""" => println("a: " + a); tpe

```

To match for example the first two instantiations in the following snippet.

```java
@searchAnonymous class MyClass {
 
  val theLabel = new javax.swing.JLabel {
    val alternateText = ???
  }

  new java.util.logging.Logger {
     ..
  }

  val thePoint =  new java.awt.Point2D()
}
```


Problem is that only the first case should be enough, as with the parameters pattern, that will match 0 or more parameter lists.
