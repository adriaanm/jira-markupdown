I've just tried to reproduce the issue with your build definition.

I removed the previously compiled Scala interfaces with:

{noformat}
% (find /Users/jason/.sbt; find ~/.ivy2) | grep compiler-interface | grep 2.11.6 | xargs rm -rf
{noformat}

And then successfully compiled sources in a project that uses your build definition:

{noformat}
% (find /Users/jason/.sbt; find ~/.ivy2) | grep compiler-interface | grep 2.11.6 | xargs rm -rf

% sbt clean compile

Can you try moving aside your ~/.ivy2 and ~/.sbt and seeing if the problem persists? If so, can you please post the output of `sbt "show update"`?
