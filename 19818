http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/12-the-scala-standard-library.html has a broken image: 

{code}
<img src="public/images/classhierarchy.pdf" alt="Class hierarchy of Scala">
{code}

The extension is .pdf. The resource is present and serves out in a new tab if requested directly,

    http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/public/images/classhierarchy.pdf

but it does not display as an embedded image.
