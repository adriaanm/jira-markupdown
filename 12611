But I'm going to apply a workaround for this issue on master branch.

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/pull/341

Try the package file which was already released after I will merge the PR.

{code}
wget https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/download/2.3.1/skinny-blank-app.zip
unzip skinny-blank-app.zip
cd skinny-blank-app
# edit build.sbt
cd skinny-blank-app/
sbt dev/console
{code}
