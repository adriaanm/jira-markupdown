When I add the Scala nature to a Java Project in Eclipse by right-clicking and selecting Scala => Add Scala Nature everything seems to work fine and I can now mix my .java and .scala class files for compilation. 
However, this only seems to work for Java projects. 
When I create a "Dynamic Web project" and do the same, Eclipse is unable to add the Scala library, etc to the classpath. I added the libraries manually, but the java class complained of referring to the missing type "def" when i tried to call a Scala method from the Java class.

I've blogged about it here: http://vikasrao.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/scala-nature-in-eclipse/
