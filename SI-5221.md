I launch the scala command from a terminal to open an interactive session. I work in the interactive session. After I close the interactive session, input from my keyboard isn't echoed anymore to my terminal. I must issue the reset command to have the terminal echo my commands as I type them again.

The Scala REPL seems to be changing something in the way the terminal echoes input, and then it isn't appropriately resetting this after execution.

[~jprupp], it would help if you provided some information on whether it's working as of the latest version in trunk.
