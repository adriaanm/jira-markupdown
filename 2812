You may spot a missing function definition in the example, however it's not the problem. The following fixed code gives the same compiler error:
{code}
package pkg1 {
    class C {
        def foo: Int = 1
    }

    trait T extends C {
        private[pkg1] abstract override def foo = super.foo + 1
    }
}
{code}
