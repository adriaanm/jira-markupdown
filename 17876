the non-nullary method in question is in Java source code, so there isn't any way for me to make it nullary to make the warning go away.
```
% cat S.scala
trait T { def foo: Int }
class S extends J with T
% cat J.java 
class J { public int foo() { return 0; } }
% /usr/local/scala-2.10.0/bin/scalac -Xlint S.scala J.java
J.java:1: warning: non-nullary method overrides nullary method
class J { public int foo() { return 0; } }
```

in my particular codebase I was able to work around it by changing "class J" to "abstract class J extends T". but it does seem like a bug.
