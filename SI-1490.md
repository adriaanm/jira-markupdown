I'm doing heavy refactoring on a medium sized project (44 source files, 3800 LOC).  The project doesn't build, there are a lot of outstanding compilation problems.

Nonetheless, here's the issue:

1) I start Eclipse and select my project's workspace
    => Errors are shown in the Problems view (this is expected)

2) Do Project -> Clean -> Clean All Projects
    => Get 50 items in the Problem View (this is expected)

3) Edit one file, insert and delete a white space, save.
    => Now I get 78 items in the Problems View
       Many of them having to do with "not found: type XXX"

So the issue is that somehow editing any file leads to an inconsistent state when some types that are known are no longer found.

I'm attaching my Eclipse logs.

I'm afraid there's not much I can do with this without a reproducible test case. Please reopen this if you can produce one.

I'm using Eclipse 3.4.1 with the nightly build of the Scala plugin on Fedora 10 (although I don't use the Eclipse packaged with Fedora). I can reproduce it on Windows Vista, too (same version).
Here's the console output of eclipse when building:
When doing clean build:
{code}
build ColoredCost.scala
build Cost.scala
build Colored.scala
build Color.scala
build Characteristics.scala
{code}

After changing Characteristics.scala:
{code}
build Characteristics.scala
late /home/Florian/workspace/Bug/src/core/colored/ColoredCost.scala
late /home/Florian/workspace/Bug/src/core/Color.scala
late /home/Florian/workspace/Bug/src/core/Colored.scala
{code}
I'll investigate further under which circumstances the problem occurs. Would the eclipse.log help?
Might be related to SI-2689 since both bugs report the same bogus message _Type not found_ after a Clean&Build (SI-2689 provides a simpler test case).
