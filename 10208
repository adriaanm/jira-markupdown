One thing you can exploit is that deprecation warnings are not issued within deprecated methods/classes. So you can coral your usages of deprecated APIs behind a facade:
```scala
scala> @deprecated("", "") def foo = 0
foo: Int

scala> object Test { @deprecated("", "") class Coral { def fooForwarder = foo }; object Coral extends Coral }
defined object Test

scala> Test.Coral.fooForwarder
res1: Int = 0
```
