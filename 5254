OK, clear easy-to-find record entered into the record.  It's definitely a duplicate.

When you enter "class Test" into the repl, the code which is compiled looks like this, which I trust makes the duplicate attribute apparent.
{code}
object lineXX$$object {
  object $$iw {
    object $$iw {
      class Test
    }
  }
}
{code}
