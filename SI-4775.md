Java example:

{code:title=JavaClass.java|borderStyle=solid}
public class JavaClass {
  public static class Element {

  }

  public static <T extends Element> int foo(Element a, Class<T> b, boolean c, Class<? extends T>... d) {
    return 1;
  }

  public static <T extends Element> int foo(Element a, Class<? extends T> b, boolean c) {
    return 2;
  }

  public static <T extends Element> int foo(Element a, Class<? extends T>... b) {
    return 3;
  }

  public static <T extends Element> int foo(Element a, boolean b, Class<? extends T>... c) {
    return 4;
  }

  static {
    foo(new Element(), Element.class, false);
  }
}
```scala

Scala example:

{code:title=ScalaClass.scala|borderStyle=solid}
class ScalaClass {
  JavaClass.foo(new Element, classOf[Element], false)
}
```

Obviously two methods are applicable, but one of them is definetely more specific (which is without varargs). 
Minimized:
```scala
class A {
  def f[T](x: T): T = x
  def f[T](x: T, xs: T*): T = x
  
  f(5)
  
  // but this works:
  def g(x: Int): Int = x
  def g(x: Int, xs: Int*): Int = x

  g(5)
}
```
Oops, missed the error.
```
b.scala:5: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method f in class A of type [T](x: T, xs: T*)T
and  method f in class A of type [T](x: T)T
match argument types (Int)
  f(5)
  ^
one error found
```
Reading section 6.26.3 of the spec, I can't even find what language implies def f[T](x: T): T should be favored over def f[T](x: T, xs: T*): T.  It seems like everyone takes for granted, that the first would be favored over the second if both were applicable, but if it's in the spec it must emerge indirectly from language too complicated for me to dissect right now.
This looks very similar to #2991, which was closed with NotABug.  

Interestingly, you can explicitly call the varargs f with f(5, Seq.empty: _*) but there is no way to specify the non-varargs method (at least I can't come up with one).

I've tried to wrap my head around the language in the relevant bit of the JLS ([section 15.12.2.5](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.5));
the "informal intuition" supports favoring def f[T](x: T): T, but I find nothing supporting that in the formal definition.  I won't even try to understand section 6.26.3 of the Scala spec on a Friday afternoon.  :)
How about
```scala
f[Int](5)
```
That's what "first of all this happens trying to infer the type parameters" means, or implies, or it's what we infer from that.  It's inferences all the way down.

You, the caller, can help by specifying type params and types of value args.  See his examples.

The rule of as-specificity, or as-specific-asness, or as-specific-asidity, is just to apply each method to the arg types of the other method.  If one applies but the other doesn't, that method is more general and the other is more specific.  This is easy to see in a case of m(A) and m(B), B <: A, but it's the same rule that applies in arcane cases.

Friday afternoon is the best time for this sort of thing, before family and religious obligations take over, or, if you prefer, after enough beer to understand the spec and before enough beer no longer to understand the spec.

Just ran into this in a real-life example writing a unit test using Mockito:

```java
        when(serviceReference.getProperty("name")).thenReturn(name)
```

Results in the compilation error:

```scala
scala: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method thenReturn in trait OngoingStubbing of type (x$1: Object, x$2: <repeated...>[Object])org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing[Object]
and  method thenReturn in trait OngoingStubbing of type (x$1: Object)org.mockito.stubbing.OngoingStubbing[Object]
match argument types (String)
        when(serviceReference.getProperty("name")).thenReturn(name)
                                                   ^
```

And to fix this, I have to be explicit in typing the instance of OngoingStubbing:

```java
        when(serviceReference.getProperty("name")).asInstanceOf[OngoingStubbing[String]].thenReturn(name)
```

Which can get pretty ridiculous, depending on the thing I'm stubbing:

```java
        when(bundleContext.getService(serviceReference)).asInstanceOf[OngoingStubbing[LoginHandler[AuthData, User, String]]].thenReturn(handler)
```

It's not Friday yet, but I guess it is time to get beer and/or pray.
