According to [http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814#AVNormalize] (section 3.3.3), leading and trailing space in non-CDATA attribute values should be discarded before passing the value to the application.


{code}val xml = <root><e attr=" test"/></root>{code}

Expected
{code}(xml \ "e" \ "@attr") == "test"{code}

Actual
{code}(xml \ "e" \ "@attr") == " test"{code}


Before I look at the source related to this, I'd like to confirm that I've correctly interpreted both the standard and the current behaviour in relation to the standard.  If anyone feels that the behaviour I was expecting is correct and would like me to help in any way, let me know and I'll be happy to do my part.

Regards,
Anthony
