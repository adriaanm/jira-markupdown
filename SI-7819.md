Currently the operand on the lhs of match is left-associative. Thus we are forced to use parenthesis around the entire match block, e.g. as follows.

{code}def f(a:String, b:B) = a + (b match {
   case Thing => "thing"
   case Thang => "thang"
}){code}

The closing parenthesis straddles such a large distance far from the original point-of-concern. Rather if match was right-associative, then in the opposing case, the parenthesis are local, e.g. as follows.

{code}def f(a:String, b:String) = (a + b) match {
   case "thing" => Thing
   case "thang" => Thang
}{code}

Or the operand could be put on the rhs of match.

P.S. I tried to post this as a new topic at scala-debate using Google Groups, yet my new topic was automatically deleted within a few seconds of posting it. I tried 3 times. I have no problem replying to existing topics there. I don't know how to report that problem. So I am filing a report here. Note I am unable to change the "Blocker" Priority setting on this bug.
Please try again on the mailing list to see if you can find the history of this choice. [scala-language] would be suitable.

I don't know myself, but if I had to guess I would say it would be so you could reason about the associativy by thinking of `match` as a regular method:

```scala
object Test {
  def `match`(a: PartialFunction[Any, Any]) = 0

  def op(t: Test.type) = t

  this op this match { case x => x }

  this op this `match` { case x => x }
}
```

```
qbin/scalac -Xprint:parser sandbox/test.scala
[[syntax trees at end of                    parser]] // test.scala
package <empty> {
  object Test extends scala.AnyRef {
    def <init>() = {
      super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def `match`(a: PartialFunction[Any, Any]) = 0;
    this match {
      case (x @ _) => x
    };
    def op(t: Test.type) = t;
    this.op(this) match {
      case (x @ _) => x
    };
    this.op(this).`match`(<empty> match {
      case (x @ _) => x
    })
  }
}
```
