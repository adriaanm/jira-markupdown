Elephant in the room. Nobody says anything about it, it's not even on the tracker:
```scala
$ cat C.scala
class C[@specialized T](t: T)
class D[@specialized T](t: T) extends C[T](t)
 
$ scalac C.scala
C.scala:2: warning: class C must be a trait. Specialized version of class D will inherit generic C[Boolean]
class D[@specialized T](t: T) extends C[T](t)
^
one warning found
 
$ cat D.scala
object Test extends App {
val x=new D(3)
println(x.getClass)
println(x.getClass.getSuperclass)
println(x.getClass.getSuperclass.getSuperclass)
}
 
$ scalac D.scala
$ scala Test
class D$mcI$sp
class D
class C
```
It will probably be closed with "Won't Fix", as it's a conscious decision in specialization. Still it's good to have a bug to refer to.
It does generate a warning, although it's hard to make sense of it without understanding the transformation:
```scala
C.scala:2: warning: class C must be a trait. Specialized version of class D will inherit generic C[Boolean]
class D[@specialized T](t: T) extends C[T](t)
^
one warning found
```
