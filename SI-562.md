RichString.capitalize doesn't check to see if the string is empty, so it throws an array out of bounds exception:

```scala
scala> "".capitalize
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
        at scala.runtime.RichString.capitalize(RichString.scala:133)
```

I would expect it to just return the empty string if it's empty. Something like this would work:

```scala
def capitalize: String = self match {
  case "" => ""
  case _ @ chars => {
    val chars = self.toCharArray
    chars(0) = chars(0).toUpperCase
    new String(chars)
  }
}
```

Or they may be a better way...

      if (self == null) null
      else


There's no need to allow null, the above can be omitted.

(null: String).capitalize  should IMHO give a Null Pointer Exception.
