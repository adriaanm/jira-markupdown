Thanks for the report. Though, the warning _does_ say: {{See the Scala docs for value scala.language.reflectiveCalls for a discussion}}

It says "*value* scala.language.reflectiveCalls"... That's explicitly telling you that it's a *value* and that it can be found in the scala.language object. You link to _trait_ "scala.languageFeature.reflectiveCalls" which is not the path that the warning instructs one to consult. 

This is the same error message for all language imports (HKT, implicit conversions, etc), and in years of it being in use, so far I can't say that I've heard any complaints that this warning not precise enough. It actually is quite precise. Therefore, I can only recommend to close this issue, as it appears that the reporter did not notice the word _value_ in the warning.
