<sub><sub>Also, if you haven't already notices, "JSON.class" exists in several jars.</sub></sub>

Tested it some more, and with the following command-line:
```scala
scalac -classpath appengine-tools-api.jar;dyuproject-util-1.1.5.jar;dyuproject-json-1.1.5.jar;dyuproject-openid-1.1.5.jar;geronimo-servlet_2.5_spec-1.2.jar src/test.scala
```
the JSON.class is present only in a single jar (appengine-tools-api.jar),
but the problem persists.

(Using jetty-util-6.1.19.jar instead of appengine-tools-api.jar solves the problem,
but it isn't possible with AppEngine Eclipse setup, where appengine-tools-api.jar
is preconfigured as part of the AppEngine libs).
