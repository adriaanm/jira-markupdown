There is a swing.Action with peer javax.swing.Action,
but there is no TextAction with peer  javax.swing.text.TextAction.

From the API of javax.swing.text.TextAction
```scala
 * An Action implementation useful for key bindings that are shared across
 * a number of different text components.
```

A TextAction has no explicit reference to a TextCompont,
but it acts on the last focused TextComponent. So you can have
a MenuItem with a TextAction which can act on each
TextComponent of the swing application.

Attached there is an implementation and an example app with
TextAction changing the fontsize.
