Vector should override isEmpty:

override def isEmpty = length == 0

Expect five fold performance increase in head, tail, last and init :)
I looked at the code. The issue seems to be that {{Vector#isEmpty}} uses {{IterableLike}}'s implementation {{!iterator.hasNext}}.

This in turn invokes `Vector#iterator`, which does a lot of work:

```scala
  @inline override def iterator: VectorIterator[A] = {
    val s = new VectorIterator[A](startIndex, endIndex)
    initIterator(s)
    s
  }
```

Using `Vector#length` to implement `Vector#isEmpty` seems to make sense, because it is only a comparison and an arithmetic operation:   def length = `def length = endIndex - startIndex`
I'd suggest that `isEmpty` should be overridden in `SeqLike` in terms of `lengthCompare`.
Jason, are you sure? Won't this also lead to the expensive creation of `Vector#iterator`: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/library/scala/collection/SeqLike.scala#L87 ?
`lengthCompare` itself is overridden in `IndexedSeqOptimized`.
