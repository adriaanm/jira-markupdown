This is extracted from the later comments of ticket #2144, which was otherwise addressed.
```scala
object Test {
  class MyGraph[V <: Any] {
    def addVertex(v: V): Boolean = true
  }

  type DuckGraph = {
    def addVertex(vertex: Int): Boolean
  }
  
  def fail(graph: DuckGraph) = graph addVertex 1

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    fail(new MyGraph[Int])
  }
}
```
```scala
$$ scala Test
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Test$$MyGraph.addVertex(int)
```
Also confirm that the fix for this bug fixes the following:

```scala
class C[+T](val x: { var y : T })
object A extends C[Int](new { var y = 1 })
(A:C[Any]).x.y = ""
```
```scala
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: A$$$$anon$$1.y_$$eq(java.lang.Object)
```
Definitely would like to see this one fixed as it kills an ideal use case for structural types. For reference my scenario posted to scala-user:

Assigning to meeting because I have an implementation to see.
Another `NoSuchMethodException`, maybe the same bug, maybe not:

```scala
val o = new {
  def f(x: Object) = new {
    def g(y: x.type) = 0
  }
}
val s = ""
o.f(s).g(s)
```
I can't follow what you are saying.

What should be disallowed? I think the code makes perfect sense, and the type checker is able to handle it correctly. Only it crashes at run-time.


```scala
scala> val o = new {
     |   def f(x: Object) = new {
     |     def g(y: x.type) = 0
     |   }
     | }
o: Object{def f(x: Object): Object{def g(y: x.type): Int}} = $anon$1@7471c619

scala> val s = ""
s: String = ""

scala> val o1 = o.f(s)
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
o1: Object{def g(y: s.type): Int} = $anon$1$$anon$2@2a11890d

scala> o1.g("huh")
