The `map` method is sitting right out in the open on the page I linked to above, I don't see how you could have trouble finding it:

Your suggestions do require an external database, for the js filtering to happen in a reasonable time frame. You're asking for all members and entities (and their signatures) of the entire Scala library and peripherals (like the actors library, Scala swing, etc) to be generated (regardless of the format) all on one HTML page and for us to provide a js filter to filter through all of it. That's not feasible or sensible via simple static HTML + js. 

A nicer UI than just static HTML? We're likely not going to change the generated format of the doc.

You're essentially asking us to build a completely different Scaladoc. This is not likely.

I remind you to consider comparing the usability of Scaladoc with javadoc.
