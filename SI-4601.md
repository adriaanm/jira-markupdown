=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
class A

trait B {
  self: A =>

  def test {
    println('blubber)
  }
}

object Test extends A with B {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    test
  }
}
```


=== What is the expected behavior? ===

No runtime verifier crash.

=== What do you see instead? ===
```scala
java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: symbol$$1
	at B$$class.test(Test.scala:13)
	at Test$$.test(Test.scala:17)
	at Test$$.main(Test.scala:19)
	at Test.main(Test.scala)
```
=== Additional information ===
This seems to be the same bug as #4560 and I'm filing this for reference since it seems to be fixed with the fix for #4560. The same rules to invoke this bug in 2.9.0 apply here: one self-type which is a trait works in 2.9.0, a self-type which is a class or multiple self-types is still broken.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0
(extempore in [r25120](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25120)) Test case closes #4601, no review.
If you happen to trip over this one: the wider issue is still not fixed if a self-type like in #4560 is used.
