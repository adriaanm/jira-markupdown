The following code

```scala
def g[T <: {def size: Int}](p: T) = println(p.size)
g(Array(1, 2))
```

raises a `java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: [I.size()`
Fixed in r13906. Simpler case of issue #397.
Whatever fix was applied, the ticket still holds with 2.7.2RC1.

Since the ticket was closed because of the fix and not because this ticket has been marked as a (kind of) duplicate of #397, I am reopening it.
This ticket has a different profile since the Array rewrite.  You can see below that it's fine with Array[Int] being of type Sized, yet if T <: Sized it's not a T.  The crash is gone though.

```scala
scala> type Sized = { def size: Int }
defined type alias Sized

scala> def g[T <: Sized](p: T) = println(p.size)
g: [T <: Sized](p: T)Unit

scala> g(Array(1,2))
<console>:7: error: inferred type arguments [Array[Int]] do not conform to method g's type parameter bounds [T <: Sized]
       g(Array(1,2))
       ^

scala> def g(p: Sized) = println(p.size)
g: (p: Sized)Unit

scala> g(Array(1,2))
2
```
The situation remains identical when using one of the original array methods (those that do not require an implicit conversion to be available), for example:

```scala
def g[T <: {def length: Int}](p: T) = println(p.length)
g(Array(1, 2))                                         
```

```scala
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: [I.length()
```
Paul's "new profile" of the bug is not related to structural types, but to the way implicits work (and which are now used for Arrays).

The situation is similar to the following:

```scala
class A
class B
implicit def a2b(a: A): B = new B

def f(p: B) = null
f(new A) // OK

def g[T <: B](p: T) = null
g[B](new A) // OK
g(new A) // error: inferred type arguments [A] do not conform to method g's type parameter bounds [T <: B]
```

Which is, I think, the expected behaviour for implicits.
