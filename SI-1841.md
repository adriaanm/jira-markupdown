I have repeatedly encountered a stack overflow error when performing joint compilation of a java/scala project. While this error is repeatable, despite my best efforts I have not been able to come up with a trivial example that demonstrates the error. It seems to be related to a combination of Scala code calling a Java method with an incorrect parameter list and the called method parameter list including a parameter of a recursive generic type, e.g. A<T extends A<T>>

I am using version 2.7.3 final.
Sorry, until you come up with at least *some* example that preferably does not use third party code (mixed java and scala is fine though), there is not much we can do about it. You might want to try out the nightly builds to see whether it has already been fixed. Feel free to reopen this ticket once you have an example. Thanks.
