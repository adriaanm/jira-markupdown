Due to bug in unlifting following code crashes with `StackOverflow`:
```scala
implicit val unliftXmlComment = Unliftable[xml.Comment] {
  case q"new _root_.scala.xml.Comment(${value: String})" => xml.Comment(value)
}
val q"${comment: xml.Comment}" = q"<!--foo-->"
```
This is caused by the fact that quasiquotes tries to recursively unwrap `xml.Node` as an iterable to figure out its rank but due to the fact that `xml.Node` is an `Iterable\[xml.Node\]` it causes infinite recursion.
