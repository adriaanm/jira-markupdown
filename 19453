That use to work on 2.11.1:

{code:scala}
trait Monad[M[_]]

def x: Monad[M forSome { type M[_] }] = ???
{code}

There seems to be an history of hate between "higher kinded" and "existential" when searching for bugs.

Is it something I should gave up on trying to use in the long term, or should I keep hope?
