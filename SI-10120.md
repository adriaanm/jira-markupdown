This could be more beginner-friendly:
```scala
scala> 'utf-8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf-8'
      ^

scala> 'utf
res1: Symbol = 'utf

scala> 'utf - 8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf - 8'
        ^

scala> ''
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
''
^

scala> 'utf8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf8'
     ^

scala> 'utf_8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
       'utf_8'
       ++++++^

```
There is no `-Xprint:scanner`. `-Ydebug` shows:

```
scala> 'utf-8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf-8'
      ^
<console>:1: error: [ suppressed ] ';' expected but something found.
'utf-8'
      ^
```

but could actually show the scansion for the line.
