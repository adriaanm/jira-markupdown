This could be more beginner-friendly:
{code}
scala> 'utf-8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf-8'
      ^

scala> 'utf
res1: Symbol = 'utf

scala> 'utf - 8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf - 8'
        ^

scala> ''
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
''
^

scala> 'utf8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf8'
     ^

scala> 'utf_8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
       'utf_8'
       ++++++^

{code}
There is no {{-Xprint:scanner}}. {{-Ydebug}} shows:

{noformat}
scala> 'utf-8'
<console>:1: error: unclosed character literal
'utf-8'
      ^
<console>:1: error: [ suppressed ] ';' expected but something found.
'utf-8'
      ^
{noformat}

but could actually show the scansion for the line.
