[[BR]]

In my .bashrc, I was setting a shell-variable "EMACS" to point to one of my emacs installations..
[[BR]]
[[BR]]

From `man bash`
```scala
       EMACS  If  bash  finds this variable in the environment when the shell starts with value "t", it assumes that the shell is running in
              an emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
```

Simply using a less Powerful (!!) name for this variable 'fixes' the issue, and scala-completion works again.
