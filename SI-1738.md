When importing a Scala project into Eclipse, the first "Building Workspace" cycle builds assuming that the output directory is the project root.  This is repeatable by creating a Scala project using Buildr and then importing it into Eclipse.  Subsequent builds function normally.
I cannot reproduce this bug in r19928.

I create a maven project from the command line (via archetype), copy and edit the .classpath, .project and pom.xml files from other projects (that use 2.8) and then I import the project in Eclipse via "File > Import > Existing Project Into Workspace". While importing I monitor the project's directory to see the generated files and I do not see the *bin* directory getting created.
