The compiler hangs with 100% CPU load when trying to compile the following piece of code with -optimise:

```scala
class Test(val s: String) { }
object Test {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var b = false
      var s: String = null
      do {
         val t = new Test(s)
         if (null eq s) b = true
         s = null
      } while (!b)
   }
}
```

The compiler was constantly at 100% CPU for more than an hour, until I aborted it. No output was produced.
Compiling without -optimise succeeds.
