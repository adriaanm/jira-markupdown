Since there is a lift method in PartialFunction, which turns PartionFunction[A,B] into Function1[A,Option[B]]. I think it is a good idea to add a partial method in Funtion1, which could turn Funtion1[A,Option[B]] into PartionFunction[A,B].

It may be defined as follows(in Function1[A,B]):
{code}
    def partial[C](implicit ev: B <:< Option[C]): PartialFunction[A,C] = x => ev(apply(x)) match {
        case Some(r) => r
    }
{code}
or:
{code}
    def partial[C](implicit ev: B <:< Option[C]): PartialFunction[A,C] = new PartialFunction[A,C] {
        def apply(v: A): C = ev(Function1.this.apply(v)).get
        def isDefinedAt(x: A): Boolean = ev(Function1.this.apply(v)(x)).isDefined
        def lift: A => B = Function1.apply(v).this
    }
{code}
This has been discussed, but it wasn't as obvious a step as lift because the semantics do not translate cleanly in this direction.  The A => Option[B] function ends up being called at least twice on every invocation.  That's fine if you know what you're getting into, but putting it on F1 maybe makes it too accessible to the unwary.

On the other hand, putting it on F1 would let us at least make (A =>? B) => (A => Option[B]) => (A =>? B) into a non-lossy operation, by keeping a copy of the other version around.  In the end, I'm with you.  Although I think I'd call it "unlift" or "delift" or some other conjugation which makes it clear it's the dual of lift.

(In r22963) Proposed implementation of 'unlift' on Function1, the inverse
function of PartialFunction#lift.  Review by rytz and other
interested parties.  References SI-3825, but not closing until this
is further considered.
(In r24312) Moved unlift to the Function companion object, which might have been
better in the first place.  Had to make a minor change to genprod,
and then I couldn't escape that unscathed.  Finished the not very
complete undertaking I found there to update the scaladoc.  Lots of
little changes to the generated text and code.

I changed genprod to only put a unique stamp on Function0 so we can
stop having a 100 file diff everytime an i is dotted somewhere.

Closes SI-3825, no review.
