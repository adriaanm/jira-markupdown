The current temporary directory for FSC is ~/tmp.  This works fine on Windows XP, where the home directory is never used.  However, it can be *extremely* annoying on Mac, Linux and Windows Vista/7.  It would be nice if FSC would use either the system-conventional temporary directory (e.g. /tmp), or a hidden configuration directory (i.e. ~/.fsc on *nix, ~/AppData/Local/fsc on Windows Vista/7, ~/Application Support/fsc on Windows XP).
This has always bugged me a lot too.  There were actually two bugs in there, in that in addition to it favoring ~/tmp over java.io.tmpdir/something, it would try to create all potential candidates before picking one; so no matter what you did that ~/tmp directory would get recreated every time you run fsc, even if it used its first choice under scala.home.

Fixed in r17215.  I don't see any reason this would impact windows, but since I don't have windows to test I trust someone will let me know if anything's broken.
