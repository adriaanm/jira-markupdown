Compile following code:

{code}
class X {
  class Y {
    class Z {
      class Z2
    }
  }
}
{code}

and check InnerClasses attribute for Z2, it'll print:

{code}
  InnerClass: 
   public #32= #29 of #31; //Z=class X$Y$Z of class X$Y
   public #33= #10 of #29; //Z2=class X$Y$Z$Z2 of class X$Y$Z
{code}

which is incomplete because entry for Y (being inner class of X) is missing.

For definition of InnerClass attribute check JVM spec. 4.8.5.

Also, checked that Java compiler generates complete table in corresponding case.
