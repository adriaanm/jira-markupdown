In a Scala project that has Task Items (via TODO and XXX tags in comments) when we do a Clean followed by a Project Build the Task Items disappear from the Tasks View.

To add the Task Items to the Tasks View again we have to go to each file and save it to trigger compilation.

This bug is probably related to SI-2689 and to the bug described [http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A--scala-tools--Error-highlights-in-Eclipse-Scala-p26480821.html here].
