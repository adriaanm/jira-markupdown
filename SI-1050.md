List has a count method and for consistency it would be good to have a similar method for all Iterables.

def count(p: A => Boolean) = {
    val elems = elements
    val count = 0
    while (elems.hasNext) { 
        val x = elems.next
        if (p(x)) count += 1
    }
    count
}
Formatting got screwed up in the last comment. 

```scala

def count(p: A => Boolean) = {
    val elems = elements
    val count = 0
    while (elems.hasNext) {
        val x = elems.next
        if (p(x)) count += 1
    }
    count
}
```
 
count is defined on Traversable in the new collections, so you can use it on range:
```scala
scala> (0 to 100).count(_ < 20)
res10: Int = 20
```
