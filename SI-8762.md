Compiler errors would be easier to read if they didn't use fully qualified type names. How 'bout a compiler option / scala-ide option to display shorter versions of the types? 

We've talked about this in person once or twice, but I don't think I've ever filed an issue. 

scala-ide shows me a very long line, with fully qualified type names: 

```scala
type mismatch;  found   : rx.lang.scala.Observable[nest.sparkle.loader.kafka.AvroKafkaLoader.TaggedBlock[Nothing,Nothing]] => rx.lang.scala.Observable[nest.sparkle.loader.kafka.AvroKafkaLoader.TaggedBlock[K,Nothing]]  required: rx.lang.scala.Observable[nest.sparkle.loader.kafka.AvroKafkaLoader.TaggedBlock[T,U]] => rx.lang.scala.Observable[nest.sparkle.loader.kafka.AvroKafkaLoader.TaggedBlock[K,U]]  
```

I'd like to see a shorter version of what scalac produces:
```scala
type mismatch;  
found: 
  Observable[TaggedBlock[Nothing,Nothing]] => Observable[TaggedBlock[K,Nothing]]  
required: 
  Observable[TaggedBlock[T,U]] => Observable[TaggedBlock[K,U]]  
```

I find it useful to copy and paste the error message and then manually format it to make it easier to read, but that seems a bit silly..

On rare occasions it would be handy to see the fully qualified names, but I'd guess most people would prefer the short version almost all the time.
