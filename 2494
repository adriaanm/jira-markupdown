Maybe maps.jar (Google Maps API in Android) is broken.
Because it seems that maps.jar in Android SDK is created by "mkstubs" in Android source tree(development/tools/mkstubs)

And, it writes in mkstubs's README.txt,

  The generated constructors are not proper. They do not invoke the matching super() before the generated throw exception. Any attempt to load such a class should trigger an error from the byte code verifier or the class loader.

I replace MapView.class and MapController.class in maps.jar with the following files.

And, work it.
