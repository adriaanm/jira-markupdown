problem is that in {{ def m(s:X[_]) {} }}, the symbol {{_}} gets pickled as "external", no loacal. the owner is {{method m}}, the unpickler tries to find a member named {{_$$1}} in {{mSym.info.decls}}.

It also happens when giving the existential a name, i.e. {{ def m(s:X[T forSome {type T}]) {} }}.

I think {{T / _$$1}} just has to be pickled as if they were local. => Ask martin what the current {{isUnrootedExistential}} logic in the pickler is for, and how to fix the current bug.
