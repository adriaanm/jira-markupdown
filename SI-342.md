Report originally due to Bob Hutchison.

The following compiles, but should not, because B does not conform to its self-type. The expected error message will be given if the val is changed to a def, or if the two classes are moved outside Test.

{code}
object Test {
    class A
    class B { this : A => }
    val x = new B
}
{code}
I can extend the example to 

{code}
object Test extends Application {
    class A { def foo () = { println("foo") } }
    class B { this : A => this.foo() }
    val x = new B
}
{code}

and get an exception when B tries to call its nonexistent {{foo}} method.  This is definitely a problem.
