The following object declares two functions which are identical except in their use of type parameterization.  They take two arguments and return the top of the stack trace, which I use to determine if a specialized version of the method was invoked.

```scala
object Test1 {
  def f1[@specialized A] (a: A, b: Any) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)
  def f2[@specialized A, B] (a: A, b: B) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("f1: "+f1(1,"some ref"))
    println("f2: "+f2(1,"some ref"))
  }
}
```

Both methods are specialized on their first type parameter.  f1's second argument is of type Any.  f2 has a second, unspecialized, type parameter and declares it's second argument to be of that type.

I would expect the main method to invoke specialized versions of both methods, since I'm passing an Int in to the sole specialized parameter.  However, the specialized variant is only getting invoked on f1:

```scala
f1: Test1$.f1$mIc$sp(X.scala:3)
f2: Test1$.f2(X.scala:4)
```

I verified that specialized versions are generated for f2.  They are just not invoked.  I also inspected the bytecode to verify that using the stack trace this way gives me accurate results.
I tried some other variants to flesh out the behavior:

1.  If I specialize both type parameters, the specialized versions are only invoked if both parameters are AnyVal subtypes.  The compiler doesn't even emit method versions for the cases where one parameter is specialized and the other is generic.

2.  If I specialize both type parameters, *and* explicitly include AnyRef in the specialized types, then the compiler at least emits method versions having one primitive argument and one Object argument.  However, thye are never invoked.  Specialized versions are only invoked when both parameters are AnyVal subtypes.  (Exception: In 2.9.2, a specialized version is also invoked when both parameters are AnyRef, although in this case the specialized code is the same as the generic code).

I'm attaching some sample code that exercises the different variants with all combinations of AnyVal vs AnyRef argument types.  It's a bit long to paste inline.
Specializing against `AnyRef` is not longer supported. It never really worked, and inflicted collateral damage.

But, specializing a subset of a method's type parameters should definitely work. I'm not that familiar with this area of the compiler, but I've put together a patch that seems to fix things:

I need to expand the test coverage and documentation before submitting a pull request.
A slightly harder test case:

```scala
object Test {
  def f1[@specialized A] (a: A, b: Any) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)
  def f2[@specialized A, B] (a: A, b: String) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)
  def f3[B, @specialized A] (a: A, b: List[B]) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)
  def f4[B <: List[A], @specialized A] (a: A, b: B) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)
  def f5[B, @specialized A] (a: A, b: List[(A, B)]) = new Exception().getStackTrace()(0)

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("f1: "+f1(1,"some ref"))
    println("f2: "+f2(1,"some ref"))
    println("f3: "+f3(1,List("some ref")))
    println("f4: "+f4(1,List(0)))
    println("f5: "+f5(1,Nil))
  }
}
```

This shows up fairly fundamental problems of phase-awareness in the specialization transform: as MethodTypes flow through InfoTransfomers they pick up new symbols for type parameters. This does not seem to be accounted.

```scala
  def specializedTypeVars(sym: Symbol): immutable.Set[Symbol] = (
    if (neverHasTypeParameters(sym)) immutable.Set.empty
    else enteringTyper(specializedTypeVars(sym.info))
  )
```
