Good stuff in there.  One thing:

> You really want to hash the raw bits of each non-reference field, not its ##, even though the latter is usually the same. 

I don't think you want to do that.  The value of ## is how you know they're equal.  If you ignore it then you will hash equal values to unequal hashcodes.
```scala
scala> case class A[T](x: T)
defined class A

scala> A(1.0f)
res0: A[Float] = A(1.0)

scala> A(1)
res1: A[Int] = A(1)

scala> res0 == res1
res2: Boolean = true  
```
I imagine I don't need to demonstrate that the raw bits of 1.0f and 1 are not identical, but:
```scala
scala> java.lang.Float.floatToRawIntBits(1.0f)
res3: Int = 1065353216

scala> 1.0f.##
res4: Int = 1

scala> 1.##
res5: Int = 1

scala> 1.0f.hashCode
res6: Int = 1065353216
```
