Yeah... I'd assumed that the value type {{A}} and parameterless method type {{=> A}} were compatible or equivalent. The only thing in the spec that vaguely justifies that assumption is:

6.26.2: A parameterless method {{m}} of type {{=> T}} is always converted to type {{T}} by evaluating the expression to which {{m}} is bound.

This is talking about the semantics of expression evaluation, though, not the typing rules...
