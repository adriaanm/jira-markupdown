It's well known that the following idiom should disable String-+:

```scala
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _, _}

object Test {
  new Object() +"abc"
}
```

Only, it doesn't anymore. You need to write:

```scala
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _, StringAdd => _, _}

object Test {
  new Object() +"abc"
}
```
The problem is that any2stringadd has spawned an evil twin in the form of the class StringAdd which is now an implicit class. I am not sure why StringAdd has to be an implicit class in the first place.


I did not realize that any2stringadd was now non-implicit. But yes, since it is part of an important idiom we should keep the name of the implicit stable.
