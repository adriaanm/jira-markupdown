I was about to ask you about that; I only noticed it after discovering -uniqid...  I thought Adriaan's comment had special significance, like LabelDefs are used differently now; but it was clear how this used to work in 2.9.  Obviously, after learning what Typer is doing for Duplicator, I could answer my questions from yesterday; but I had to stick treeBrowser.browse in a few places to get the picture.  For future newbies, one might think of Duplicator.retyped as .reduplicate as opposed to tree.duplicate.

I'll be curious to see the rest of the fix if there's more; you don't just get the enclosing context?  Sorry I didn't get it done. :)
