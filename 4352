Setting aside the issue of compiler complexity, the proposed syntax is already spoken for. `Map[_, _]` is an existential type, it is shorthand for `Map[A, B] forSome { type A; type B}`

For the particular example, you can avoid repeating the types of the key and value by inferring them on the right-hand-side.
```scala
import collection.mutable.HashMap
var x : collection.Map[Int, Int] = new HashMap() 
```

Closing as needinfo. Might I suggest that you raise these sort of questions first on scala-debate, where you will get a wider audience for discussion?
