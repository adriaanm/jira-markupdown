The Complex value type has long been missing from Java, and Scala's fresh and dynamic environment has the ability to fill that void.  Although the effort of each developer requiring a Complex type to implement their own is not insurmountable, the benefit of having a standard library definition would be great.  Not only would it save the developer work and possible bugs, it would also provide a common definition for Scala libraries in the future to integrate with each other.

Existing code from Double and RichDouble could be used as a starting point for an implementation.
a welcome contribution, indeed: assigning to scala_community
I wouldn't mind a crack at implementing this. Something like:

```scala
trait Complex[S] extends Numeric[Complex[S]] {
  def toPolar: PolarComplex[S]
  def toCartesian: Cartesian[S]
}

trait CartesianComplex[S] extends Complex[S] {
  val r: S
  val i: S
}

trait PolarComplex[S] extends Complex[S] {
  val r: S
  val theta: S
}

object Complex {
  def polar[S](r: S, theta: S) = ...
  def cartesian(r: S, i: S) = ...
}
```

Is this the sort of API you where thinking of?
It would be nice to be able to write :

```scala
val a = 1 + i
val b = 1e(Math.PI/4)
```
