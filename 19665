The {{matchesName}} method in {{scala.tools.nsc.transform.Constructors.scala}} currently matches any parameter which starts with the param.name, followed by the join symbol ($). This has the possibility of wrongly matching a parameter during compilation which will silently compile without warnings and introduce problems in runtime.

A minimal reproducible is easy, and will create the same problem in all use-case versions of Scala:

{noformat}
scala> case class Invoice(`total tax`: Int, total: Int)
defined class Invoice

scala> Invoice(`total tax` = 20, total = 120)
res0: Invoice = Invoice(20,20)

scala> res0.total
res1: Int = 20
{noformat}

A proposal would be to change the method from 
{noformat}
def matchesName(param: Symbol) = param.name == name ||
  param.name.startsWith(name + nme.NAME_JOIN_STRING)
{noformat}

to

{noformat}
def matchesName(param: Symbol) = param.name == name ||
  param.name == name.append(nme.NAME_JOIN_STRING)
{noformat}

I'll make a PR with the failing test, to discuss the potential solution.
