A bad cli option should hard exit. Instead the bad option is interpreted as a source file containing documentable content.
```scala
11:16 $ ./scaladoc -h
scaladoc error: bad option: '-h'
  scaladoc -help  gives more information
error: source file '-h' could not be found
model contains 1 documentable templates
two errors found
```
