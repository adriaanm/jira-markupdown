In MacPorts we install symlinks into $prefix/bin for all the shell scripts.  The symlinks are relative, so `scala` is a symlink to ``../share/scala-2.10/bin/` instead of using an absolute symlink (makes it slightly more relocatable.)  This works in 2.9 and breaks in 2.10.  The 2.10 code works if one is cd'ed into the directory where the symlink resolved, but most times people are not cd'ed into $prefix/bin.

# This works:
cd /tmp
tar xvfz /opt/local/var/macports/distfiles/scala29/scala-2.9.2.tgz
mkdir bin
cd bin
ln -sf ../scala-2.9.2/bin/scala .
cd /
/tmp/bin/scala


# This doesn't work:
cd /tmp
tar xvfz /opt/local/var/macports/distfiles/scala210/scala-2.10.0-M3.tgz
mkdir bin
cd bin
ln -sf ../scala-2.10.0-M3/bin/scala .
cd /
/tmp/bin/scala


Returns

/tmp/bin/scala: line 15: cd: ../scala-2.10.0-M3/bin/..: No such file or directory
Error: Could not find or load main class scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner

I'll change the symlinks in MacPorts to absolute.

I do not think this is scala's issue per se.  What I see is that it works fine unless you use /tmp specifically, because /tmp itself is a symlink to /private/tmp.

That means if you do this:

  cd /tmp
  mkdir bin
  cd bin
  ln -s ../path/to/scala

You create a bogus symlink, because bash (wildly guessing you're using bash) "helpfully" resolves .. according to the path by which you arrived.  It acts as if you're in /tmp/bin, but you're in /private/tmp/bin.

To verify this is the problem, try it from /private/tmp instead of /tmp and I think you'll find it works.  (At least, I do.)

Hi Paul,

I tried this on my Ubuntu 12.04 system with /tmp being a real directory and I got the same error.

Now having seen it work on multiple systems, I stand by the assessment.  You will need something pretty convincing to make me disbelieve this.

Not re-opening until I can prove this ;)

Is local at /local?  In that case, I believe the symlink's leading ..'s will go back to / so it'll continue to work.  With your current test of the scala symlink, can you cd somewhere deeper and try it, say /usr/share/doc, where ../.. doesn't take you to /.

You got it.  Maybe fixed in 4cd0253d0d .  I won't be winning any awards for the code but it should only arise in this slightly perverse scenario so if it works for you then it works.

Was looking for the latest in resolving script paths and found my way to this issue.

If you take an even more perverse scenario:
{code}
relative/scala -> ../bin/scala
relative/again/scala -> ../scala
{code}
with multiple relative symlinks, then the fix in 4cd0253d0d also won't work.

Just trying something now that could be better. Will put it in a pull request.
