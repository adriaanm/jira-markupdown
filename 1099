I can't review the whole patch right now, but as one quick comment, scala-compiler.jar is available in scala-dev in the "scala-devel" package.  For build.properties, I think it would be fine just to say the properties aren't set, without checking for file existence and without making a file copy.  The file copy could mean that one build fails and the next succeeds -- but with default options rather than user-chosen ones.

Otherwise these changes sound fine, though I haven't looked at the diff.
