The offending bytecode looks as follows (the trouble is with the number of locals, which presumably should be greater or equal than 1):

{code}
public static int wrapper();
  Code:
   Stack=1, Locals=0, Args_size=0
   0:   aload_0
   1:   invokespecial   #18; //Method x$1:()I
   4:   ireturn
{code}
