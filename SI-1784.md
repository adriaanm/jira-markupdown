Hello,
I got the url from here http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94 and it seems that neither the normal , nor the nightly-build url works.

Apparently the url (http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/scala-plugin/) is being redirected to http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/scala-plugin/ , where i get the 403 forbidden: 'You don't have permission to access /archives/downloads/distrib/files/scala-plugin/ on this server.'

thanks,
Alex
Sorry, 
the original url is actually http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin.And it doesn't work.

It was a copy/paste error in the message.
