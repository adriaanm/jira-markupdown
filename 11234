This is also related to scala/bug#7963. 

If a process is connected to stdin, even after the process exits, the reading thread is still around waiting for input. As soon as input is given, it unblocks and either realizes it has been interrupted, or just fails trying to write to a close stream. Since there is basically no way to have an interruptible stream on System.In, there isn't much we can do (except polling...)
