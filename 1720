Well, for what it's worth there are these two commented out lines in TypeKinds:
{code}
    // case WildcardType => // bq: useful hack when wildcard types come here
    //  REFERENCE(definitions.ObjectClass)
{code}
And if I uncomment those, it works.  What does "useful hack when wildcard types come here" mean, you might rightfully ask? Your guess is at least as good as mine.
