final class Foo1(a: Int) {
  def isEmpty = false
  def get     = this
  def _1      = a
}
object Foo1 { def unapply(x: Foo1) = x }

final class Foo2(a: Int, b: Int) {
  def isEmpty = false
  def get     = this
  def _1      = a
  def _2      = b
}
object Foo2 { def unapply(x: Foo2) = x }


// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Foo1
defined object Foo1
defined class Foo2
defined object Foo2

scala> new Foo1(1) match { case Foo1(a) => Array(a) }
res0: Array[Foo1] = Array(Foo1@6340e5f0)

scala> new Foo2(1, 2) match { case Foo2(a, b) => Array(a, b) }
res1: Array[Int] = Array(1, 2)
{code}

For clarity, I expected {{res0}} to be {{Array[Int]}} not {{Array[Foo1]}}.

I believe this is as specced, but I submit as counter-proof that [~moors] expected it to work as well: "Looks like it doesn't work for Product1":

Maybe res0 should be {{(1)}}. If you want {{1}}, define {{get}} appropriately.
Why? res1 isn't {{((1), (a))}}
res1 is a tuple, so res0 should be a tuple, too. Probably I expect to iterate over the Product elements.

Uniformity was discussed in comments to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7897 

It's inconvenient to special-case Product1 just because n == 1.



I changed the examples to use array, so we don't get all hung-up on confusing the arity of the extractor with the arity of the return type.

It returns {{Array(Bippy(1))}} when it should return {{Array(1)}}.
Simplified the test case to {{Foo1(a: Int)}} and {{Foo2(a: Int, b: Int)}}.

{{res0}} is an {{Array[Foo1]}} where I expected it to be an {{Array[Int]}}.
