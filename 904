Although this bug is clearly related to SI-1722, I seem to have fixed it in r17228 without actually fixing SI-1722, so we must presume "edifice" to be inaccurate.  I'm crossing my fingers that any minute now my debugging process will cease to include the sacrifice of a goat under the light of a harvest moon.
