I propose adding a trait like the following to the standard library:
```scala
trait Comprehendable[C[+_], +A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): C[B]
  def flatMap[B](f: A => C[B]): C[B]
  def filter(p: A => Boolean): C[A]
}
```
This trait would then be mixed into those traits and classes that currently implement the methods required for comprehensions.  The primary advantage of this is it makes it easier to explain how to make something work with comprehensions, and common related functionality could be refactored into this particular trait.

I am open to suggestions on the name.  I would be okay with calling in MonadZero or some such, but I figure Comprehendable might be clearer to most people.

The only real problem at the moment is that Seq implements
```scala
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Iterable[B]): Seq[B]
```
rather than
```scala
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Seq[B]): Seq[B]
```
May I suggest something like the following:

```scala
trait Comprehendable[+A] {
  type AbstractC[+A]
  type C[+A] <: AbstractC[A]
  
  def map[B](f: A => B): C[B]
  def flatMap[B](f: A => AbstractC[B]): C[B]
  def filter(p: A => Boolean): C[A]
}

trait Iterable[+A] extends Comprehendable[A] {
  type AbstractC[+A] = Iterable[A]
}

trait Seq[+A] extends Iterable[A] {
  type C[+A] = Seq[A]
}
```
Recording a mail from miles sabin to scala-user in case it's useful when/if someone implements this:
```scala
The trick here is to factor out the recursion as an additional type
parameter (type-level Y combinator anyone?). For 2.7.5 the following
works,

object Fors {
  
  type Comprehendable[C[+_], +A] = {
    def map[B](f: A => B): C[B]
    def flatMap[B](f: A => Iterable[B]): C[B]
    def filter(p: A => Boolean): C[A]
    def foreach(f : (A) => Unit) : Unit
  }                                                                             

  def four[C[+_], A](c : Comprehendable[C, A]) {
    for(e <- c)
      println(e)
  }                                                                             

  def main(args : Array[String]) {
    val l = List(1, 2, 3)
    four[List, Int](l)
  }                                                                             
}                                                                               

Note that because of the lack of inference for higher-kinded types you
have to supply explicit type parameters at the call site of "four".

Interestingly the version for 2.8.0 is completely different as a
result of the collections redesign. The following works relative to
trunk,

object Fors {

  type TT[+A, +This] = TraversableTemplate[A, This] with Traversable[A]
  type BF[B, That, This] = BuilderFactory[B, That, This]

  type Comprehendable[+A, +This <: TT[A, This]] = {
    def map[B, That](f : (A) => B)
      (implicit bf : BF[B, That, This]) : That
    def flatMap[B, That](f : (A) => Traversable[B])
      (implicit bf : BF[B, That, This]) : That
    def filter(p: A => Boolean): This
    def foreach[U](f : (A) => U) : Unit
  }                                                                             

  def four[A, This <: TT[A, This]](c : Comprehendable[A, This]) {
    for(e <- c)
      println(e)
  }                                                                             

  def main(args : Array[String]) {
    val l = List(1, 2, 3)
    four(l)
  }                                                                             
}
```
