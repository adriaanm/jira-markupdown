From the laundry-list of improvements and suggestions mentioned so far, I've picked two categories (recovering optimized stability, and refactoring of {{InliningPhase}}) as candidates for inclusion in 2.10-M5. Those changes are tracked in SI-5891 . The corresponding pull request will be a beautified version of branch [recoveringOptimizedStability | https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/master...recoveringOptimizedStability] . 

As before, the focus of SI-5442 remains finding a more robust way to avoid {{IllegalAccessError}} (eg using unpickling as mentioned in the previous comment).
