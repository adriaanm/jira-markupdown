This is related to ticket #824, but may be not known:

scala> def test(x: Any)= x match {
     |       case _: Array[String] => println("String-Array")
     |       case _ => println("no match")
     |     }
test: (Any)Unit

scala> val arr= Array("hallo")    
arr: Array[java.lang.String] = Array(hallo)

scala> test(arr)
String-Array

scala> test(Array("hallo"))
no match
 
Don't worry, it's known all too well.  Closing as duplicate of #824 among others.
