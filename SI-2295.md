  protected def buffer(pos: Int, ns: Seq[Node]): NodeBuffer = {
    val nb = new NodeBuffer()
    var jt = ns.elements
    var j = 0; while (j < pos-1) {
      nb.append(jt.next)
      j += 1
    }
    nb
  }

Should be while (j < pos) otherwise the pos-1 node will not be put to NodeBuffer.
Please search trac and try a nightly build before reporting bugs.  I fixed this a couple months ago, and yours is the second duplicate bug report (see SI-2273) to be opened since then.
