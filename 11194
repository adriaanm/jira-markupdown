It'd be great to see this fixed. I was wondering why I hadn't hit it myself, which lead me to a *partial* workaround: 

In the failing example, `TypeAlias` is an alias that refers to another alias `@@`. Ive had success using aliases for tagged types, but Ive always defined directly in terms of unaliased types, eg 
```
type Distance = Int with TagAs.Tagged[DistanceObj.type]

object TagAs {
  trait Tagged[+U]
}
``` 

That is, can't stack 2 aliases over a tagged type, but 1 seems OK.
