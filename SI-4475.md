=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
  import scala.Math
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
It shouldn't be available anymore, either for 2.9 (it was already deprecated in 2.8) or in the future.

=== What do you see instead? ===
It's still there.

=== Additional information ===
Scala 2.8: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Math$$.html
Scala 2.9: http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/Math$$.html
Yes, agreed. However as reminders go, it suffices that `@deprecated` annotations (with both `since` and usage example) are there all over object scala.Math.
