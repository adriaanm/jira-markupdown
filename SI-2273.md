Using 2.7.5:

In using a RewriteRule to strip some elements, I found that it tends to strip elements I am not asking it to strip, unless there is whitespace between them.  See enclosed program.

I would expect, with no whitespace between elements, to end up with a final XML of:

<reportList><report><sourceId>foo</sourceId><reportId>bar</reportId></report></reportList>

Instead, I get:

After: <reportList><report><sourceId>foo</sourceId></report></reportList>

<reportId>bar</reportId> mysteriously stripped!
From Bryan Castillo on scala-user:

I tracked it through in a debugger using eclipse. I think if i+= 1 is moved
before the check for unchanged or buffer is changed so that while (j <
pos-1) is while (j < pos).

These 2 methods seem to be the culprits from BasicTransformer.

  def transform(ns: Seq[Node]): Seq[Node] = {
    var i = 0
    val it = ns.elements
    try {
      while (it.hasNext) {
        val n = it.next
        val n2 = transform(n)
        if (!unchanged(n, n2)) {
          throw NeedsCopy(n2)
        }
        i += 1
      }
      ns
    } catch {
      case NeedsCopy(n2) =>
        val nb = buffer(i, ns)
        nb ++= (n2:Iterable[xml.Node])
        transform(it, nb)
    }
  }



  protected def buffer(pos: Int, ns: Seq[Node]): NodeBuffer = {
    val nb = new NodeBuffer()
    var jt = ns.elements
    var j = 0; while (j < pos-1) {
      nb.append(jt.next)
      j += 1
    }
    nb
  }
Another comment from Bryan on scala-user:

```scala
The documentation from BasicTransformer for buffer seems inconsistent with
the implementation of it.

  /** Returns a new node buffer with the first <code>pos</code> elements
   *  from <code>ns</code>.
   *
   *  @param pos ..
   *  @param ns  ..
   *  @return    ..
   */
```
As far as I know I fixed all this stuff a while ago.  Please try trunk before reporting bugs.  Here is after the trunk output.
```scala
After: <reportList><report><sourceId>foo</sourceId><reportId>bar</reportId></report></reportList>
```
