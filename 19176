A default implicit Ordering seems to exist for all built-in types and some other classes (e.g. BigDecimal, Option[T]). I would think Symbol belongs in this distinguished category of types too, since it even has a literal syntax. But it has no Ordering:

scala> scala.collection.SortedSet('a, 'b)
<console>:18: error: No implicit Ordering defined for Symbol.
              scala.collection.SortedSet('a, 'b)
