Don't panic! The only real problem I can see here is that the `private[this] def x` in `B` should not override the inherited `x` yet it does. I believe the same error is in order here as if `x` had been declared `private def x`. For `private[this] val x` (which is *far* more common) the test is not necessary because fields don't override on the JVM. That's a relief because adding the test would probably cause lots of programs to break.
