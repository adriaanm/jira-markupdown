Yeah, really pretty :)

Here's another minification:

{code}
object Test2 {
 def test(name: String) = 12
}
class strangeTest(x: Int) extends scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

trait A {
  @strangeTest(Test2.test("test")) def test(x: String): Unit
}

// compile separately
// trait B extends A { val name = 12 }
{code}

From looking at your graph I'd say the VALsyms in the method type probably introduce the new bindings (although I don't understand why trees in an annotation would ever be  allowed to introduce anything into any context).
