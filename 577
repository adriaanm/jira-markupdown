FYI, the workaround that Martin in suggested in response to another report of mine (SI-733) also works in this case;
the code compiles if I change it to read:
{code}
class RichIterableInt(it:Iterable[Int]) { def sum = it.foldLeft(0)(_ + _) }
implicit def iterableWithSum(it: Iterable[Int]) = new RichIterableInt(it)
println((1 to 10).sum)
{code}
perhaps the changes you suggest to how scripts works are still a good idea, though.
