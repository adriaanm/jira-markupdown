What I would really like to see (in e.g. scala.util) is a convenience class to create virtual machine shutdown hooks, like one normally implements this way:

```scala
scala> Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(
     |   new Thread(new Runnable() {
     |     override def run() { println("I'm the shutdown code") }
     |   }))
```

Of course the shutdown code is most likely something shutting down an ExecutorService or closing a stream or socket, etc. As you can see in the example it's really boilerplate, no closures ... so what I currently use and what serves me well is the following implementation:

```scala
/**
 * A virtual machine shutdown hook.
 *
 * Registered shutdown hooks are executed when the virtual machine
 * terminates normally. For more information read the documentation
 * of [[Runtime]].
 *
 * @constructor creates an unregistered instance
 * @param name the shutdown hook's name (for e.g. logging purposes)
 * @param body code to execute when the shutdown hook is executed
 */
final class ShutdownHook(
    val name: String,
    private[this] val body: => Unit) {

  def this(body: => Unit) = this("", body)

  private[this] val hook = new Thread(new Runnable() { def run { body } }, name)

  /** Registers this as a virtual machine shutdown hook. */
  def register() = {
    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(hook)
    this
  }

  /** Deregisters this from the virtual machine. */
  def deregister() = Runtime.getRuntime.removeShutdownHook(hook)

  override def toString = "ShutdownHook("+name+")"
}

/** Factory for [[ShutdownHook]] instances. */
final object ShutdownHook {
  /** Creates a registered instance. */
  def apply(name: String, body: => Unit) = new ShutdownHook(name, body).register()

  /** Creates a registered instance. */
  def apply(body: => Unit) = new ShutdownHook("", body).register()
}
```

So know creating a VM shutdown hook is as easy as:

```scala
$$ scala -i ShutdownHook.scala
Loading ShutdownHook.scala...
defined class ShutdownHook
defined module ShutdownHook

Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_23).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> ShutdownHook(println("foo :)"))
res0: ShutdownHook = ShutdownHook()

scala> :q
foo :)
$$
```

Hopefully, this makes it into library.jar :)

I'm getting in my time machine again.
```scala

```
Feel free to suggest things after looking at what's already there.  It's generally hard to get feedback until there's a release, because nobody ever looks at the work in progress.  Hint hint.
