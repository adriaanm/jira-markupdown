I was hoping it would have been easy to create a test for this using the [existing Presentation Compiler testing infrastructure](https://github.com/scala/scala/tree/master/src/interactive/scala/tools/nsc/interactive/tests), but it isn't the case (I'm not saying that it is not possible, but it requires more time than I'm currently willing to invest). On the other hand, it should be fairly easy to create a regression test for this on the Scala IDE side.
