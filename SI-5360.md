After Scala language syntax highlighting is installed (scala.lang), gedit outputs an error message to console when started, e.g:

(gedit:31839): GtkSourceView-WARNING **: in file /home/user/.gnome2/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs/scala.lang: style 'scala:other' not defined

Looking at scala.lang, it's true, there is no style defined for type *other*.  This can be easily fixed, for example by adding 
`<style id="other" _name="Other" map-to="def:special-char"/>`
to the <styles> sections.  *special-char* isn't used for anything else, and in the default colourscheme, it's a plausible colour for annotations.

See attached scala.lang with above change; gedit starts without whingeing, and annotations get a syntax highlight.
