I am not sure about building a test case without the Vaadin jar.
Although the best guess is that Java inner classes are involved I don't know how to easily extract
all the potentially problematic code out of Vaadin.

If you have a fix I would be happy to try out your snapshot scala compiler with the fix on my project if you can make it available.
