Bryan,

I don't want to put down your complaints on stability of Scala; it's a rather widespread feeling.

Despites all that I still choose to invest in it, since I find that the advantages might outweight the costs of fighting with rough edges.

Hence, I would really grateful if you find some time to provide more details on the kind of issue you are having. You mentioned eclipse projects issuing build errors. Can you please provide some sample code that breaks the compiling of mixed scala and java?
