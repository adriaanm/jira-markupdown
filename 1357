The new error you're reporting is harmless noise (it happens only on Eclipse startup, and has no adverse effects other than error log entry). Your original problem with Javadoc hovers has been fixed by updating to Eclipse 3.4.1, so I'm closing this again.

If you're having a new or/different issue, please create a fresh ticket with a detailed explanation of the issue and ideally a reproducible test case.
