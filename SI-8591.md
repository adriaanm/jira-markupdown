I can't scroll contents of the right iframe under Safari on iOS.

Currently the only way to navigate between type members is to use members' filter. But this workaround requires being familiar with given member or at least having enought time to play with some 'brute-force' filtering.

I figured out how to fix it and I'm going to prepare pull request with appropriate fix.
Great. Can we close #6781 as well?
