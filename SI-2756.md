The following code generates several val defs where 'arg' is given the same symbol. It only works now because they are always assigned the same thing, so the fact that only one physical location is used does not matter.

This affects the backend in another way, when it emits variable ranges for debug info. Currently it ignores such cases, keeping them in scope until the end of the method. However, for the jvm-1.6 target, type information about such locals should be emitted only when they are in scope. Unhappiness hits.

{code}
class Foo {
  def stringOf(arg : Any): String = arg match {
    case arg: List[_] => arg.toString
    case _ => arg.toString
  }
}
{code}

after explcit outer:

{code}
    def stringOfSI-8520(argSI-9938: AnySI-22): java.lang.StringSI-1655 = {
      var temp1SI-10756: AnySI-22 = argSI-9938;
      if (temp1SI-10756.isInstanceOfSI-3915[List[_SI-9993]]())
        {
          {
            var temp2SI-10757: List[_SI-9993] = temp1SI-10756.asInstanceOfSI-3918[List[_SI-9993]]();
            {
              {
                val argSI-9992: List[_SI-9993] = temp2SI-10757;
                if (true)
                  {
                    {
                      val argSI-9992: List[_SI-9993] = temp2SI-10757;
                      body%0SI-10764(argSI-9992){
                        argSI-9992.toStringSI-10308()
                      }
                    }
                  }
                else
                  throw new MatchErrorSI-788(temp1SI-10756.toStringSI-3914())
              }
            }
          }
        }
      else
        {
          if (true)
            {
              body%1SI-10829(){
                argSI-9938.toStringSI-3914()
              }
            }
          else
            throw new MatchErrorSI-788(temp1SI-10756.toStringSI-3914())
        }
    }
  }

{code}

It appears that through a series of improvements culminating with your change in r20987, the tree after explicitouter looks pretty much optimal.
{code}
    def stringOfSI-8377(argSI-9891: AnySI-31): java.lang.StringSI-2080 = {
      var temp1SI-12082: AnySI-31 = argSI-9891;
      if (temp1SI-12082.isInstanceOfSI-5134[List[_SI-9946]]())
        {
          temp1SI-12082.asInstanceOfSI-5137[List[_SI-9946]]().toStringSI-10270()
        }
      else
        {
          argSI-9891.toStringSI-5132()
        }
{code}
One of my goals with partest was to be able to put tests in place for this sort of thing -- too painful and fragile at the moment.  And I don't think the underlying bug is fixed anyway.  But I could use a new example, should you have any in mind.
(In r24812) Working my way through pattern matcher sequence issues mostly caused
by the special handling of Lists.  Also deleting all kinds of
useless or almost useless code which is presently only clutter.

Closes SI-2756, SI-2800, SI-3050, SI-3530, SI-3972, no review.
