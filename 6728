Thanks for the prompt answer, it's impressive.
I still hope that this subcase can be handled more easily, since here, unlike in SI-2712, Scalac does not have to synthesize a type function, but it is handed to it on a plate and it must just be kind-checked and the kind compared with the desired one.
