I might not know what I'm doing but the compiler should give me a more sensible error message.

With 
{code}
class Symbol(val name: String) extends (Symbol => Symbol) {
  override def toString() = name
  override def apply(that: Symbol) = new Symbol(name + " " + that.name)
}
{code}

I get 
{code}
scala> val hello = new Symbol("Hello")
hello: Symbol = Hello
scala> val world = new Symbol("World!")
world: Symbol = World!
scala> hello world
<console>:6: error: value world is not a member of Symbol
       hello world
{code} 

which is in blatant contradiction to what it has just finished saying.

No the error message is perfectly sensible.  There is no field or method called "world" in the class Symbol.  What you probably wanted to write was
{code}
  hello(world)
{code}
