According to the contract of [Compiler.parseTree](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/interactive/scala/tools/nsc/interactive/CompilerControl.scala#L232), no symbol should be entered in the returned tree. [This ticket in the Scala IDE project](https://scala-ide-portfolio.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1001986) proves the contract is broken.
