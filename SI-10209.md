Seems to lose a side effect.
```scala
$ scala
Welcome to Scala 2.12.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_111).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala>  object A { val u: Unit = { println("ok"); () } }
defined object A

scala> A.u

scala> A
ok
res1: A.type = A$@5b35c7d

```
The getter call is replaced by `BoxedUnit.UNIT` because `isExprSafeToInline`. I'm not sure if that's intentional, the [doc comment](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.1/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/TreeInfo.scala#L159-L166) says

"References to modules [] are side-effecting [] but they are safe to inline because the expression result from evaluating them is always the same"
