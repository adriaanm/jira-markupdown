The following crash happens when invoking `scalac -optimise -d classes -target jvm-1.5 symbol.scala`
I have updated the files: symbol.scala should compile without any external dependencies.

Note that `scalac -optimise` is very easy to crash for *any* non-trivial source module.
So the example included here is more or less arbitrary.  (These sources are from [http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/src/Pure])
