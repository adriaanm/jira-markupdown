I tried that fix in my example, I get (cut/paste from Eclipse)
```scala
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
type WrappedKey is not a member of object GHashMap	GHashMap.java	/Bug/src	line 104	Scala Problem
```
where the line in question reads
```scala
        this(hasher, new HashMap<WrappedKey, V>());
```

So your revised example, strictly speaking, is too minimal.
