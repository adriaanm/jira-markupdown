Does this still affect 2.11 and 2.12 versions? I think it does.

The following [test|https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/1543] in Zinc is failing because of it. Could someone confirm this hasn't been fixed in new Scala versions and set those versions in the ticket?

This constant inlining could be perjudicial for a lot of Zinc users that make intense use of final vals. I think it would make sense to fix this and I'd be happy to take a stab at it. I'd like to know if [~moors] or [~retronym] would accept such a PR for next 2.12.x and 2.11.x series (if there's to a be a new version for 2.11). A time estimate to fix this would also be very useful to pick the appropriate moment to implement it. I think this could be a blocker for a fully stable Zinc 1.0 release (though we could probably live with it since it depends on the compiler).
