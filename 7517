Well, it took me a long time to see it.  No more letting me do your debugging for you, kris!
```scala
  new F[A, C] {
    def apply(xv: X[A]): X[C] = f(new XX(xv) with XPrint[B])
  }
```
Since you're inside an anonymous F, that new XX is in the F[A, C] being created.  You want "new outer.XX(sv)" at which point it compiles as given (with or without variance.)
