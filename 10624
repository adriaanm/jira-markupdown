I have to use regexes periodically or I totally forget how to use them.  Thanks for the opportunity to keep it fresh.

The javadoc uses severe language:

Note that backslashes (\) and dollar signs ($) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string.

An exception is a different result.

The scaladoc tries to tell you to use quoteReplacement.  The message is slightly confusing.
```scala
scala> val p = Pattern compile "cat"
p: java.util.regex.Pattern = cat

scala> val m = p matcher "one cat two cats"
m: java.util.regex.Matcher = java.util.regex.Matcher[pattern=cat region=0,16 lastmatch=]

scala> m replaceAll """\"""  // single backslash escapes nothing
java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 1
  at java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:658)
  at java.util.regex.Matcher.appendReplacement(Matcher.java:762)
  at java.util.regex.Matcher.replaceAll(Matcher.java:906)
  ... 32 elided

scala> m replaceAll (Regex quoteReplacement """\""")
res3: String = one \ two \s

scala> "one cat two cats".replaceAllLiterally("cat", "\\")
res4: String = one \ two \s

scala> "cat".r.replaceAllIn("one cat two cats", Regex quoteReplacement """\""")
res5: String = one \ two \s
```

Maybe someday a macro will warn if a literal replacement string is not quoted for literal escapes.

I'll also use this occasion to note that retronym's suggestion to truncate the repl stack trace was the best ever to hit jira.
