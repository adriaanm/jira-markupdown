In java compiling Foo.java will always result in Foo.class (and an
arbitrary number of other classes as well).  Build tools
(like ant) determine if Foo.java needs to be rebuilt by comparing
the times of Foo.java and Foo.class.

The scalac ant task does this as well.

With the present behaviour, if Foo.scala does not contain
a class (or a "object") with the name Foo, then ant with
the scalac task (or other java build tools) will rebuild 
Foo.scala on every build.

The present workaround is to run "ant -v" to find what is
being pointlessly built and add a "object Foo {}" to the
top of such files.

Build tools use the filesystem as their database, so the fact
that a file is compiled needs to leave some evidence on the
filesystem that can be determined by the filename alone.

While not a perfect solution: I would propose that Foo.scala
always generate Foo.class (and empty class if required).

I admit that this is a little bit gross ... but the alternative
is even worse (and is confusing new users, or resulting in users
getting the feeling that scalac is just a slow compiler when
the problem is that they are rebuilding lots of their application
all the time).
