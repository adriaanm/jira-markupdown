the javadoc for Iterable claims "This trait adds methods... zipWithIndex, ...", but:
{code}

scala> (List(1,2,3): Iterable[Int]).zipWithIndex
<console>:5: error: value zipWithIndex is not a member of Iterable[Int]
       (List(1,2,3): Iterable[Int]).zipWithIndex
{code}

perhaps it is intentional that zipWithIndex is present only on Sequence, not Iterable?
if so, then it's just the javadoc that needs fixing.
