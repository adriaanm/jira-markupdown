The following only compiles with the 'filter' method, however it is never called:

{code}
  object Foo
  {
    def foreach( f : ((Int,Int)) => Unit ) 
    {
      println("foreach")
      f(1,2)
    }
//    def filter ( f : ((Int,Int)) => Boolean ) =
//    {
//      println("filter")
//      this
//    }
  
    for( (a,b) <- this )
    {
      println((a,b))
    }  
  }
{code}
Firstly, if you read the specification the first thing that happens during desugaring of pattern matching is that, 
{code}
for ( (a,b) <- this )
{code}
becomes
{code}
for ( (a,b) <- this.filter( case (a,b) => true; case _ => false } )
{code}
And if you indeed look at the AST following typechecking, this is indeed the case.  However, sometime during the superaccessors or refchecks phase, {{filter}} is eliminated.  Therefore, this seems to be a bug, but only because something is being too aggressive about optimizing out the call to filter, which is the identity other than being side-effecting.
Actually, I do understand the Spec differently (might be misunderstanding it though):

The translation scheme is as follows. In a first step, every generator {{p <- e}}, where
p *is not irrefutable* (�8.1) for the type of e is replaced by
  {{ p <- e .filter { case p => true; case _ => false } }}

A pattern p *is irrefutable* for a type T, if one of the following applies:

*3. p is a constructor pattern c(p 1 , . . . , p n ), the type T is an instance of class c, the primary constructor (�5.3) of type T has argument types T1 , . . . , Tn , and p i is irrefutable for Ti .*

Isn't Tuple2 irrefutable, but filter is only used for non-irrefutable types?  


Everything else I would consider a performance bug as the following would copy the array by calling its filter method:

{code}
val pairs : Array[(Int,Int)] = ...

for((first,second) <- pairs) printf("First: %4d\t Second: %4d\n", first, second)
{code}
@Jason, since #1893 (the revert) was not accepted, is this still an issue?
If so, what caused it to regress?

Scala 2.11.5 has been released.

Also, this should be linked to SI-5589 (which is perhaps a even more common occurrence of this bug).
