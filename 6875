(extempore in [r26091|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26091]) Fixed -Xfuture 5.ds, deprecated 0-octal.

I messed up my trip to the future the first time around; now in
the future 5.f is not an error but an attempt to call method "f"
on 5 like nature intended. (Thank you simon for catching this.)
And deprecated leading 0 for octal.  Closes SI-5205.
