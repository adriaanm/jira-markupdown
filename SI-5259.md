With trunk as of 2.10.0.r26093-b20111130020250 compiling the following,

```scala
class A[T]
class B {
  def m(a: A[this.type] = new A[this.type]) { }
}

object DefaultArgBogusTypeMismatch {
  def newB = new B

  newB.m()

  // this compiles
  // val stableB = new B
  // stableB.m()
}
```

Results in the error report below,

```scala
t5259.scala:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : A[_2.type] where val _2: B
 required: A[_1.type] where val _1: B
  newB.m()
       ^
```

Adriaan's comment is that it shouldn't be necessary to existentially abstract over the "this" reference, which is what's causing the problem here.
This is not so easy to fix. The invocation

```scala
newB.m()
```

is first transformed by named/default args to

```scala
{ val qual$1 = newB
  qual$1.m(qual$1.m$default$1)
}
```

In the method call `qual$1.m`, the qualifier tree `Ident(qual$1)` is created in `blockWithQualifier` using `gen.mkAttributedRef` which doesn't assign a `SingleType`.

That's why the qualifier has type `B` instead of `SingleType(qual$1)`. Selecting the `m` method therefore has an existential type
{noformat}qual$1.m: (a: A[_1.type])Unit{noformat}

Note that I applied a small change which runs the type-checker on the `Select` node, instead of assigning the type directly:

```
-          val f = Select(gen.mkAttributedRef(sym), selected)
-                   .setType(baseFun1.tpe).setSymbol(baseFun1.symbol)
+          val sel = Select(gen.mkAttributedRef(sym), selected)
+          val f = blockTyper.typedOperator(sel)
```



Then there's the question why `qual$1.m$default$1` also has an existential types, but I guess it's something along the same lines.


Anyway, I'll stop working on this for now, it seems a very cornery case, and there's no deep underlying bad bug, it's due to the singleton `this.type`.
Oh, I just realized that we can create an `Ident` tree and type-check it instead of using `gen.mkAttributedRef`, that should be fine in this case (it's always an Ident to a the local value). So now the question is only about `qual$1.m$default$1`
