scala> scala.collection.parallel.ParSeq()
res0: scala.collection.parallel.ParSeq[Nothing] = ParArray()

scala> Nil == res0
res1: Boolean = false

scala> res0 == Nil
res2: Boolean = true
{noformat}

There will be other examples of this.  Don't change Nil or ParSeq please without first establishing exactly what is supposed to be equal to what.  Before the arrival of the parallel collections, the algorithm was as described here: http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections_41.html
