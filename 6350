Judging from the last commit message it seems like this one should be closed, but it isn't.

I ran the badsigs tool and it doesn't report any errors:
```scala
Root is /home/soc/Entwicklung/badsigs
Working dir is /tmp/badsigs.VG0Ed
Checking /home/soc/Entwicklung/badsigs/./classes/:
Running Main app (will generate Java files and run ecj)
```

I guess this can be closed?
