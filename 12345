Note that the indirection through the type alias {{Door.K}} is not a factor here; the error message is the same if you take that out and just write {{val key: Key with h.K}}.

I haven't studied both tickets closely, but SI-6130 looks loosely related (but there is no extractor here, so this one seems more fundamental).
