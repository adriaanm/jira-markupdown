Note that the indirection through the type alias `Door.K` is not a factor here; the error message is the same if you take that out and just write `val key: Key with h.K`.

I haven't studied both tickets closely, but scala/bug#6130 looks loosely related (but there is no extractor here, so this one seems more fundamental).
