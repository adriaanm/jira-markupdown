(In r23384) Some issues with Tuple2/3.  There was a stray wrong-arity
foreach method in Tuple3, and both classes have what is now
a redundant zip method which is also unfortunately completely
strict in a not entirely fixable fashion.  So "zip" is
deprecated in favor of zipped.  Closes scala/bug#3526, but the code
which closes that is primarily found in r23228.  No review.
