Being able to toggle the "Concrete" and "Abstract" buttons is nice, but I think it'd be better to put all the abstract members of a trait/class in their own section above the concrete members.  Figuring out how to minimally implement a trait/abstract class is easily in the top 10-20 use cases for scaladoc. :)
(In r24658) Separated abstract and concrete value members in scaladoc.
This looks like such a runaway improvement to me that I'm just
checking it in, but if anyone feels differently say the word.
I eliminated the abstract/concrete filter entirely as it is
extraneous once you can just see which is which.

Closes #3831, review by malayeri.
