REPL freezes with par in for comprehension expression:

For example, you can type in REPL is standard mode:
var count = 0
for (i <- 1 to 10 par) count += 1 // after this line REPL freezes
println(count) // no output

But if one type this sample in :paste mode - it's OK. (see attachment)
Use {{-Yrepl-class-based}} if you want to start threads in the expression, which is a member initializer.

Alternatively, put it behind a {{def}}.

That's not a workaround, but the required technique. So this is not a bug per se. Not sure what changed for 2.12, maybe encoding of lazy vals or some other implementation detail.

Github makes adding a link so easy, jira makes it so hard.
