As a newbie reading through the document and doing exercises, I expect an exercise that says "replace the ??s with logic" that the exercise will function when putting the correct logic in.  I shouldn't have to make additional changes, or if I should, the exercise should hint at it.

For instance, when trying to run my solution, I get
exercise5.2.1.scala:3: error: ':' expected but ',' found.
	def iter(a, result) = {
                  ^
exercise5.2.1.scala:8: error: identifier expected but '}' found.
}
^
two errors found

and after fixing that error,

exercise5.2.1.scala:5: error: recursive method iter needs result type
		else iter(a+1, result + f(a))
                     ^
one error found
(In r19980) The text of "Scala By Example" has been amended; the
correction will be available in the next release of the
manual (the updated version, built every night,
is available at http://www.scala-lang.org/node/212/pdfs )

Closes #2706
