The following code compiles and runs with 2.7.7 but fails to compile
with 2.8.0.Beta1-RC1:

```scala
abstract class Base

object Test
{
  def run(c: Class[_ <: Base]): Unit = {
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
  {
    val sc: Option[Class[_ <: Base]] = Some(classOf[Base])
    sc match {
      case Some(c) => run(c)
      case None =>
    }
  }
}
```

```scala
t.scala:12: error: type mismatch;
 found   : java.lang.Class[_0] where type _0
 required: Class[_ <: Base]
      case Some(c) => run(c)
```
I think this is a bug in the pattern matcher, because of which c's type is not propagated properly

changing the line to
```scala
      case Some((c: Class[_ <: Base])) => run(c)
```

results in:

```scala
/Users/adriaan/git/scala/test/pending/pos/t2635.scala:12: error: not found: type _$$3
      case Some((c: Class[_ <: Base])) => run(c)
```

this was probably an existing bug that was unmasked by the fix for #513
(In r19769) Closed #2635
