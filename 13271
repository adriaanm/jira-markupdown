Array.concat is not correctly implemented. There was a change last year to accept Seqs rather than Arrays as arguments, but the implementation wasn't touched.

{code}
scala> Array.concat(List(3, 3), List(35, 3))
> java.lang.ArrayStoreException

{code}

Eric Willinger the following in a recent thread:

"Yes, if this function is to accept an arbitrary sequence of Seq[T], then 
the comment should be "Concatenate all argument sequences" and a working 
implementation would simply add a .toArray call inside the loop:
   
{code}
def concat[T](xs: Seq[T]*) = {
     var len = 0
     for (x <- xs) len += x.length
     val result = new Array[T](len)
     var start = 0
     for (x <- xs) {
       copy(x.toArray, 0, result, start, x.length)
       start += x.length
     }
     result
   }
{code}
"
