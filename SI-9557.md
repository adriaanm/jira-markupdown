The spec says:
```scala
id ::= plainid | ‘`’ stringLiteral ‘`’
```
That seems fine.  But what is {{stringLiteral}}?
Section 1.3.5 says
```scala
stringLiteral  ::=  ‘"’ {stringElement} ‘"’
```
This seems wrong because I don't need double quotes to make a back-quoted identifier.
```scala
stringLiteral   ::=  ‘"""’ multiLineChars ‘"""’
```
seems wrong for the same reason.

What is a {{stringLiteral}}?

Side question: which escape characters are allowed in the identifier string literal?  Because it's some, but apparently not `\``

Thanks!
The Scala 2.9 spec pdf defines `id ::= plainid | ‘`’ stringLit ‘`’`, but I couldn't find a definition of `stringLit` anywhere.
You have come up with a use case for triple backticks.
```scala
val ```abc`def``` = 42
```
There is revised language at [this change](https://github.com/som-snytt/scala/commit/ab527ce8cc0220443bda5cc3337ebae158c2fe74) around "printable". I don't see a more recent nightly or 2.12 spec yet, but [the source says this](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/spec/01-lexical-syntax.md#string-literals).

Also conceivably, it could accept ``abc\u0060def`` by blessing the unicode form.

Backtick is not [backslashable](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/01-lexical-syntax.html#escape-sequences).
@apm I'm saying that the definitions and usage of `stringLiteral` in my initial ticket, taken together, aren't true.
I've run into this error in the specification too.

So if the second form of non-terminal {{id}} is not back quotes (Unicode GRAVE ACCENT) around a string literal-\-which can contain unescaped back quotes--what exactly _is_ the syntax the second form of {{id}}?
