If you have a Scala project and you included a java project and it includes another java project that has exported classpath entries, these classpath entries do not get included in the top level project when compiling and you get compiler errors.

Example:
ProjectA
ProjectB
ProjectC

ProjectA has a dependency on ProjectB
ProjectB has a dependency on ProjectC which exports a classpath entry for JarA

when ProjectA is compiled, scala files do not compile because JarA is not in the classpath.

The fix is to put JarA in the classpath of ProjectA, but that really isn't desired.

You claim that ProjectA should have JarA in its classpath but this is not the behavior that JDT has. In order for ProjectA to have JarA in its classpath ProjectB must export ProjectC so we have JarA exported by ProjectC and ProjectC exported by ProjectB that is a dependency of ProjectA.

The above works perfectly well in trunk but unfortunately there are some issues with the build manager so if you use multiple projects you have sometimes to do a clean&build to see the updates.

Miles you should close this issue as invalid since the behavior described in the ticket is not compatible with JDT and SDT implements JDT's behavior correctly.
