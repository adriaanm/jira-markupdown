Can't believe I'm still finding things out about the language...
```scala
An assignment ~\lstinline@$$f$$($$\args\,$$) = $$e$$@~ with a function application to the
left of the `\lstinline@=@' operator is interpreted as 
~\lstinline@$$f.$$update($$\args$$, $$e\,$$)@, i.e.\
the invocation of an \code{update} function defined by $$f$$.
```
(I don't know how to get a readable excerpt from the spec so I'm pasting the latex.)

So apparently this means (intentionally? I think so, but not sure) that you should "inline args" so that:
```scala
// the obvious one for which there are examples
x(a) = b  // x.update(a, b)
// less obvious
x(a, b) = c // x.update(a, b, c)
// less obvious still
x() = a  // x.update(a)
```
There are no conditions under which one would first expect that f.update(args, e) means that update is variable-arity from 1-N, so I think such a thing should be very explicit and have at least one example of both the "x() = a" sort and "x(a, b) = c" sort.  Even if it might technically be derivable from the language which is present.
It seems that the following is also accepted,

```scala
scala> class Up { def update(as : Int*) {} }                                                                 
defined class Up

scala> val up = new Up                      
up: Up = Up@129dcc0

scala> up() = 0

scala> up(0) = 1

scala> up(0, 1) = 2

scala> up(0, 1, 2) = 3

scala> 
```
And perhaps even more bizarrely the following is also accepted,

```scala
scala> class Up { def update(as : Int*)(d : Double) {} }
defined class Up

scala> val up = new Up                                  
up: Up = Up@1890c67

scala> (up(0) = 1)(1.0)                                 
```

I'm sure someone can find something useful to do with this.
