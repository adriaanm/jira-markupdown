If you test below snippet you'll notice that only the 2nd field will react properly on FocusLost events. looking at the source code of 2.7.2's TextField, it's obvious (I think) there's a "publish()" lacking to surround the "EditDone(TextField.this)" inside the FocusAdapter.

(PS: this is my first ticket here so bear with me if I did something wrong).
```scala
import scala.swing._
import event._
import java.awt.event.FocusAdapter

object Funfocus extends SimpleGUIApplication {
 def top = new MainFrame {
  contents = new BoxPanel(Orientation.Vertical) {
   contents += new TextField {
    reactions += { case EditDone(my) => println("field 1 content: " + my.text) }
   }
   contents += new TextField {
    val me = this
    peer.addFocusListener(new FocusAdapter {
     override def focusLost(e: java.awt.event.FocusEvent) { publish(EditDone(me)) }
    })
    reactions += { case EditDone(my) => println("field 2 content: " + my.text) }
   }
  }
 }
}
```
