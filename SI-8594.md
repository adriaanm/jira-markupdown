I've found that a constant source of performance issues is the lack of this method in the Map trait:

{code}
trait Map[K, V] {
  def mapEntries[V2](f: (K, V) => V2): Map[K, V2]
}
{code}
Ultimately, if you want to build a new Map from an existing Map (and which has the same keys), but the values of the new map are defined by a function which depends on both the key _and_ value (by far the most common case, in my experience), you have to do this (which is O(N)):

{code}
kvs map { case (k, v) => k -> f(k, v) }
{code}

What's more, using the enhance-my-library pattern to add {{mapEntries}} to Map, or even to construct ones own Map type which contains this method is sub-optimal, the former because each time a Map is converted to a MappedEntriesMap, that is O(N) and the latter, well, that's because it involves MapLike, MapFactory and general unpleasantness. What's more, you still lose because you pay a gradual price in extra object creation overhead (I attach a file, {{map.scala}} which contains such a new Map type, so you can see what the overhead is)

All in all, it would be nice if instead of this in {{collection.MapLike}}:

{code}
def mapValues[C](f: B => C): Map[A, C] = new MappedValues(f)
protected class MappedValues[C](f: B => C) extends AbstractMap[A, C] with DefaultMap[A, C] {
  override def foreach[D](g: ((A, C)) => D): Unit = for ((k, v) <- self) g((k, f(v)))
  def iterator = for ((k, v) <- self.iterator) yield (k, f(v))
  override def size = self.size
  override def contains(key: A) = self.contains(key)
  def get(key: A) = self.get(key).map(f)
}
{code}
We had this:

{code}
def mapEntries[C](f: (A, B) => C): Map[A, C] = new MappedEntries(f)
protected class MappedEntries[C](f: (A, B) => C) extends AbstractMap[A, C] with DefaultMap[A, C] {
  override def foreach[D](g: ((A, C)) => D): Unit = for ((k, v) <- self) g((k, f(k, v)))
  def iterator = for ((k, v) <- self.iterator) yield (k, f(k, v))
  override def size = self.size
  override def contains(key: A) = self.contains(key)
  def get(key: A) = self.get(key).map(v => f(key, v))
}
{code}
Then the mapValues implementation just becomes:
{code}
def mapValues[C](f: B => C): Map[A, C] = mapEntries((_, b) => f(b))
{code}
This is a pretty simple change and (it seems to me) a rather big win for little effort.

A colleague pointed out that {{Map.transform}} does a lot of what I want (except it requires a new map to be structurally built - it's strict, unlike my preference above)

2 points

* I'm adding this comment in case anyone else stumbles over this issue and wants a workaround
* It's pretty astonishing that it is possible for an experienced Scala dev to be able to peruse the type signatures of Map's methods and completely miss that a method with the signature they were looking for already exists (impossible to tell from the CBF version, of course!). Use-case on map being what it is and all :-(
