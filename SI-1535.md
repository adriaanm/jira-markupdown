In the following program, when both n.x and n.y are printed, the second one is printed as its default value (0 or false) rather than 42 or true. Thus the version below prints

```scala
42
false
```

instead of

```scala
42
true
```

From an examination of the generated bytecode, the reason seems to be that two lazy vals end up sharing a bit in the bitmap$$0 field, so the second field erroneously appears to have been evaluated when it hasn't.

The BlockStmt class is important.  If ClassDecl directly inherits from ASTNode then the bug does not occur.

```scala
class ASTNode {
    lazy val x = 42
}

class BlockStmt extends ASTNode

class ClassDecl extends BlockStmt {
    lazy val y = true
}

object Main extends Application {
    val n = new ClassDecl ()
    println (n.x)
    println (n.y)
}
```
