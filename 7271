There are many improvements that are pending for the Scala.Net toolset (not only the compiler). One of such goals is allowing multi-platform deployment of Scala programs that use only the Scala library. Getting there requires more resources than are currently assigned to the Scala.Net project(s). "Special-casing" won't get us there sooner, and it's me who has the most to lose if Scala.Net isn't successful so as you can imagine I'm paying attention to those details.

Coming back to the toString() vs. ToString() discussion, for now there are other areas of Scala.Net that require our effort.
