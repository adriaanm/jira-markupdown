I would like to place the script below in my Scaladoc header or footer:

    <script type='text/javascript' src='http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML'></script>

Doing so would allow me to write math symbols in my Javadoc for a complex machine learning library I am writing which involves lots of math.

Unfortunately, I can't find anyway to do so. There is -doc-footer, but this escapes the HTML before inserting it into the doc so that it doesn't render.

[The Scaladoc code|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/9e30bee0c9363f6cf36a7b65ddbaaa225b57d6a9/src/scaladoc/scala/tools/ant/Scaladoc.scala#L22] (btw, this is an old commit. where is the current code?) references -header and -footer options, but these don't appear to actually exist. I'm guessing whoever wrote this class copy/pasted from the Javadoc code? Would it be possible to add these methods for parity with Javadoc?
I'd be interested in this, and would be willing to take a stab at it. Any thoughts or suggestions, @ureche?

As @sethtisue told me, Scaladoc is part of the Scala compiler so it should be in the https://github.com/scala/scala repository, mostly under src/scaladoc/scala/tools/nsc, but I haven't looked into it yet.

It looks like Spark has [solved|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16822] the problem by directly [editing api-docs.js|https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14438/commits/2a480caba91dd912eeda8b2b4393f9be11061310 ].

Could we make this the default behavior?
[~ureche] auto-complete worked for me just now
