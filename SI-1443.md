```scala

foo: [A](A)(implicit (A) => List[A])List[A]

scala> foo(1)
<console>:10: error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both method b in object Testing of type [A <: AnyRef with java.io.Serializable](A) => List[A]
 and value a in object Testing of type => (Int) => List[Int]

This looks similar to tickets #1272 and #298, but I don't think it's the same.
(probably by fix for #2421)
