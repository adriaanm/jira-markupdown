The following code compiles without any warning:
```scala
package test

final class Foo(val value: Int)
object Foo {
  def unapplySeq(foo: Foo): Some[Seq[Int]] = Some(List(foo.value))
  /*def unapply(foo: Foo): Some[Int] = Some(foo.value)*/
}

sealed trait Tree
case class Node1(foo: Foo) extends Tree
case class Node2() extends Tree

object Test {
  def transformTree(tree: Tree): Any = tree match {
    case Node1(Foo(1)) => ???
  }
}
```

But if you uncomment `unapply`, you get:
```scala
test2.scala:14: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: Node1(_), Node2()
  def transformTree(tree: Tree): Any = tree match {
                                       ^
one warning found
```

It'd be nice to give the same warnings when only `unapplySeq` is used, for example with `List`.
