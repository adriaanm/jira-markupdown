This is essentially #7753, which is probably #6161, but it seems like something to fix. It's really amazing how hard it is to use the language which is advertised in the brochure.

One thing I noticed while debugging this is that the logic for comparing prefixes is completely borked. Watch isSameType assessing the equivalence of two types and rejecting them though they resolve to the same thing. Up close you can see it following logic with code like this:
```scala
trait Trait { type Foo }
object Stable extends Trait { type Foo = Int }
```
*scala, thinking*: Is **Stable.Foo** the same type as **scala.Int** ? Hmm, Foo has prefix "Stable.type" but Int has prefix "scala.type". Verdict: **REJECT**

This reduced manifestation:
```scala
trait Thing { type A }
object IntThing extends Thing { type A = Int }

// compiles
package p1 {
  class View(val in: Thing { type A = Int }) {          def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
  class SubView extends View(IntThing)       { override def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
}
// does not compile
package p2 {
  class View[AIn](val in: Thing { type A = AIn }) {          def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
  class SubView extends View[Int](IntThing)       { override def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
}
// c.scala:12: error: method f overrides nothing.
// Note: the super classes of class SubView contain the following, non final members named f:
// def f(p: AIn): AIn
//   class SubView extends View[Int](IntThing)       { override def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
//                                                                  ^
// one error found
```
Here is a revealing look at how various forms of the same type are viewed in a subclass. What do you think "T" means in B.
```scala
trait Thing { type A; var p: A = _ }
class A[T](final val x: Thing { type A = T }) {
  type Q = T

  def x1: T   = x.p
  def x2: Q   = x.p
  def x3: x.A = x.p
}
class B extends A[Int](null) {
  def y1 = x1
  def y2 = x2
  def y3 = x3

  // After typer:
  // def y1: Int = B.this.x1;
  // def y2: B.this.Q = B.this.x2;
  // def y3: B.this.x.A = B.this.x3;
  //
  // After uncurry:
  // def y1(): Int = B.this.x1();
  // def y2(): Int = B.this.x2();
  // def y3(): T = B.this.x3();
}
```
I was able to fix this, and the code in my comment in #7753, without affecting either the original #7753 or #6161.
Interested to see where you managed to finesse this!

Reducing the example from your comment and adding an explicit type:

```scala
trait Thing { type A; var p: A = _ }
class AA[T](final val x: HasA { type A = T }) {
  def foo: x.A = ???
}

class B extends AA[Int](null) {
  override def foo: B.this.x.A = super.foo
}
```

Leads to:

```
sandbox/test.scala:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : B#7645.this.x#14044.A#14051
    (which expands to)  T#7883
 required: B#7645.this.x#14044.scala.A#15337
    (which expands to)  scala#21.this.Int#1760
  override def foo: B.this.x.A = super.foo
```

The `scala.` part looks like a bug in type printing, something must be using the prefix of the normalized type there.

The second symbol for `A` comes from the as-seen-from of the selection `B#7645.this.x` in the type of the overriding method.

```scala
     // Base class
    <method> <triedcooking> def foo#14047: AA#7882.this.x#14044.A#14051 = scala#21.this.Predef#1992.$qmark$qmark$qmark#7269

    // Sub class
    <method> override def foo#15326: B#7645.this.x#14044.A#15337 = B#7645.super.<error: method foo#14047>#25431
```

I guess you've ended up in:

```scala
  private def equalSymsAndPrefixes(sym1: Symbol, pre1: Type, sym2: Symbol, pre2: Type): Boolean = (
    if (sym1 == sym2)
      sym1.hasPackageFlag || sym1.owner.hasPackageFlag || phase.erasedTypes || pre1 =:= pre2
    else
      (sym1.name == sym2.name) && isUnifiable(pre1, pre2)
  )
```

and `isEligibleForPrefixUnification`. I seem to remember pushing those around in a previous excursion out of the trenches.

Okay, git tells me that was in the aborted attempt at #8071

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3267
Here's my dabble: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket;8177?expand=1

Note that one of the tests (from the comments of #7753) is stuck in pending-ville.
Just pushed another commit that shows a way to make `AsSeenFrom::classParameterAsSeen` figure out the correct `nextBase` in light of refinement types.

```scala
        def nextBase = {
          val base = if (clazz.isRefinementClass) {
            pre.baseTypeSeq.toList.find(_ <:< clazz.info).getOrElse(NoType)
          } else pre baseType clazz
          base.deconst
        }
```
Moving Paul's test case from #7753 over here, as I closed that ticket as not-a-bug.

```scala
trait CC[A]
trait HasElem[Repr] { type A }
object ccInt extends HasElem[CC[Int]] { type A = Int }
 
object Test {
  final class View[Repr, AIn](repr: Repr, val tc: HasElem[Repr] { type A = AIn }) {
    // For a time it's completely convinced AIn and tc.A are the same type.
    def equivalence1[B](implicit ev: B =:= AIn) = true
    def equivalence2[B](implicit ev: B =:= tc.A) = true
    def evidences = List(equivalence1[tc.A], equivalence1[AIn], equivalence2[tc.A], equivalence2[AIn]) // 4 out of 4
 
    // Foreshadow.
    def f1(p: AIn): AIn = p
    def f2(p: tc.A): tc.A = p
  }
 
  def xs: CC[Int] = ???
  val view = new View[CC[Int], Int](xs, ccInt)
 
  // No longer equivalent, transitivity lost.
  def g0 = List(view.equivalence1[Int], view.equivalence2[Int])
  // b.scala:33: error: Cannot prove that Int =:= Test.view.tc.A.
  //   def g0 = List(view.equivalence1[Int], view.equivalence2[Int])
  //                                                          ^
 
  def g1 = view f1 5  // compiles
  def g2 = view f2 5  // fails
  // b.scala:31: error: type mismatch;
  //  found   : Int(5)
  //  required: Test.view.tc.A
  //     (which expands to)  AIn
  //   def g2 = view f2 5  // fails
  //                    ^
}
```

This is the one that needs the tweak to `nextBase` described in the previous comment.
Here's what I did. I'm not saying it's any better; really I don't believe there is a correct way to handle it given the compiler architecture. 

https://github.com/paulp/scala/compare/issue;8177
Noting that my patch can lead to SOE.

```scala
scala> trait T[A] { val foo: { type B = A } = ???; def bar(b: foo.B) = () }
defined trait T

scala> object O extends T[Int] { /*bar(0)*/ }
defined object O

scala> val bar = typeOf[T[_]].member(newTermName("bar"))
bar: $r.intp.global.Symbol = method bar

scala> typeOf[O.type].memberInfo(bar)
res0: $r.intp.global.Type = (b: O.foo.B)Unit

scala> val seenFromParamType = typeOf[O.type].memberInfo(bar).params.head.info
seenFromParamType: $r.intp.global.Type = O.foo.B

scala> val paramType = bar.info.params.head.info
paramType: $r.intp.global.Type = T.this.foo.B

scala> val seenFromParamTypePreInfo = seenFromParamType.asInstanceOf[TypeRef].pre.typeSymbol.info
seenFromParamTypePreInfo: $r.intp.global.Type = AnyRef{type B = Int}

scala> val paramTypePreInfo = paramType.asInstanceOf[TypeRef].pre.typeSymbol.info
paramTypePreInfo: $r.intp.global.Type = AnyRef{type B = A}

scala> seenFromParamTypePreInfo <:< paramTypePreInfo
KABOOM
```

The `<:<` added to `nextBase` can recursively call `asSeenFrom` by way of `specializedSym`.
The dodgy owner of the refinement class in the param accessor type is a verbatim copy of that in the constructor parameter's tpt. We really ought to run a TypeMap over that to spit out a type with the class as owner of refinements therein. Or, take another swing at:

```scala
      private def derivedTpt = {
        // For existentials, don't specify a type for the getter, even one derived
        // from the symbol! This leads to incompatible existentials for the field and
        // the getter. Let the typer do all the work. You might think "why only for
        // existentials, why not always," and you would be right, except: a single test
        // fails, but it looked like some work to deal with it. Test neg/t0606.scala
        // starts compiling (instead of failing like it's supposed to) because the typer
        // expects to be able to identify escaping locals in typedDefDef, and fails to
        // spot that brand of them. In other words it's an artifact of the implementation.
        val tpt = derivedSym.tpe_*.finalResultType.widen match {
          // Range position errors ensue if we don't duplicate this in some
          // circumstances (at least: concrete vals with existential types.)
          case ExistentialType(_, _)  => TypeTree() setOriginal (tree.tpt.duplicate setPos tree.tpt.pos.focus)
          case _ if mods.isDeferred   => TypeTree() setOriginal tree.tpt // keep type tree of original abstract field
          case tp                     => TypeTree(tp)
        }
```

If we do that, I'd want to make sure that the typer infers singleton types correctly in cases like:

```scala
val s = ""
class C(val ss: s.stype)
```
Could you show the entire code for that still-failing example?

I tried:

```scala
trait HasA { type A; var p: A = _ }
class AA[T] {
  type HasAT[T] = HasA { type A = T }
  val x: HasAT[T] = ???
  def foo: x.A = ???
}
 
class B extends AA[Int] {
  override def foo: B.this.x.A = super.foo
}
```

There's a chance that it is only working because of my in-flight changes.
BTW, we also need to extend our tests to things like:

```scala
class A[T](final val x: Thing { type A <: T }) {
```

I haven't tried, but I suspect that your approach might fail to unwrap these.
Just to add another angle: #6596 demonstrates that refinement owners aren't consistent in joint and separate compilation.

Martin's states over there: "I believe owners for refinement types are a compiler-internal artefact only.".

That might be true, but the compiler does need to make sense of the owners for asSeenFrom to work, as this ticket shows.
Here's a test case which compiles for me but not at the time I tried your 8177 branch.
```scala
trait HasA { type A; var p: A = _ }

package p1 {
  class AA[T](final val x: HasA { type A = T }) { def foo: x.A = ??? }
  class B extends AA[Int](null) { def bar: B.this.x.A = foo }
}

package p2 {
  object Types { type HasAT[T] = HasA { type A = T } }
  class AA[T](final val x: Types.HasAT[T]) { def foo: x.A = ??? }
  class B extends AA[Int](null) { def bar: B.this.x.A = foo }
}
```
In your branch I changed the last line of isEligibleForPrefixUnification to
```scala
case _                     => (tp ne tp.dealias) && isEligibleForPrefixUnification(tp.dealias)
```
Which allowed that to compile and all tests still passed, so if it introduces something bad it's on the untested side of the ledger.
Well, maybe type aliases plus named classes will do it after all. It's a pretty heavy burden though.
```scala
package p {
  trait Indexed[A]
  trait Indexable[Repr] { type A }
  object Indexable {
    implicit def indexedIsIndexable[A0] : Indexable[Indexed[A0]] = new Indexable[Indexed[A0]] { type A = A0 }

    /** It works if we instead write that conversion as: */
    // class IndexedIsIndexable[A0] extends Indexable[Indexed[A0]] { type A = A0 }
    // implicit def indexedIsIndexable[A] : IndexedIsIndexable[A] = new IndexedIsIndexable[A]
  }

  object IndexedView {
    def apply[Coll](repr: Coll)(implicit tc: Indexable[Coll]): IndexedView[Coll, tc.A] = new IndexedView[Coll, tc.A](repr)(tc)
  }
  final class IndexedView[Coll, A](val repr: Coll)(implicit val tc: IndexableType[Coll, A]) {
    final def map[B](f: A => B): IndexedView[Coll, B] = ???
    final def force: Indexed[A] = ???
  }

  class Foo {
    def bufferAt(i: Int): String  = ???
    def indices: Indexed[Int]     = ???
    def contents: Indexed[String] = indices map bufferAt force
    // ./a.scala:23: error: type mismatch;
    //  found   : Int => String
    //  required: tc.A => ?
    //     def contents: Indexed[String] = indices map bufferAt force
    //                                                 ^
    // one error found
  }
}

package object p {
  implicit def liftIndexedView[Coll](repr: Coll)(implicit tc: Indexable[Coll]): IndexedView[Coll, tc.A] = IndexedView(repr)

  type IndexableType[Repr, A0] = Indexable[Repr] { type A = A0 }
}
```
You're stripping the refinement from the `implicit def indexedIsIndexable`. Either leave off the return type, or repeat it in full.

It compiles for me with this change:
```scala
    implicit def indexedIsIndexable[A0] = new Indexable[Indexed[A0]] { type A = A0 }
```
I'd probably go for a term alias to go with `IndexableType`. Sure, it's not such a big change, but you sound like a camel with a lot of straws on your back at the moment, so maybe removing one little one might help.

```scala
package p {
  trait Indexed[A]
  trait Indexable[Repr] { type A }
  object Indexable {
    implicit def indexedIsIndexable[A0] : IndexableType[Indexed[A0], A0] = IndexableType[Indexed[A0], A0]
  }
 
  object IndexedView {
    def apply[Coll](repr: Coll)(implicit tc: Indexable[Coll]): IndexedView[Coll, tc.A] = new IndexedView[Coll, tc.A](repr)(tc)
  }
  final class IndexedView[Coll, A](val repr: Coll)(implicit val tc: IndexableType[Coll, A]) {
    final def map[B](f: A => B): IndexedView[Coll, B] = ???
    final def force: Indexed[A] = ???
  }
 
  class Foo {
    def bufferAt(i: Int): String  = ???
    def indices: Indexed[Int]     = ???
    def contents: Indexed[String] = indices map bufferAt force
  }
}
 
package object p {
  implicit def liftIndexedView[Coll](repr: Coll)(implicit tc: Indexable[Coll]): IndexedView[Coll, tc.A] = IndexedView(repr)
 
  type IndexableType[Repr, A0] = Indexable[Repr] { type A = A0 }
  def IndexableType[Repr, A0]: IndexableType[Repr, A0] = new Indexable[Repr] { type A = A0 }
}
```

Sorry to rewind all the way to the top, but regarding
> scala, thinking: Is Stable.Foo the same type as scala.Int ? 
> Hmm, Foo has prefix "Stable.type" but Int has prefix "scala.type". Verdict: REJECT

Shouldn't this fallback to normalizePlus?

```scala
scala> trait Trait { type Foo }
defined trait Trait

scala> object Stable extends Trait { type Foo = Int }
defined object Stable

scala> typeOf[Stable.Foo] =:= typeOf[scala.Int]
res0: Boolean = true
```
As a workaround for your rebellious thing, I suggest:

```scala
trait Thing { type A }
object IntThing extends Thing { type A = Int }
 
class View[T <: Thing](val in: T) {          def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
class SubView extends View(IntThing)       { override def f(p: in.A): in.A = p }
```
Trying to get a closer look as follows:

```scala
scala> trait Thing { type A }
     | trait View[AIn] {
     |   val in: Thing { type A = AIn }
     |   type Bla = in.A // 
     | }

scala> typeOf[View[Int]].memberType(typeOf[View[Int]].member(newTypeName("Bla")))
res1: $r.intp.global.Type = AIn // AHA! should be Int

```
Right, which is why running things through asSeenFrom again works:
```scala
scala> typeOf[View[Int]].memberType(typeOf[View[Int]].member(newTypeName("Bla")))
res2: $r.intp.global.Type = AIn

scala> res2.asSeenFrom(typeOf[View[Int]], typeOf[View[Int]].typeSymbol)
res3: $r.intp.global.Type = Int
```
It would help if I better understood what is the resistance to more aggressive dealiasing. I don't mean stuff like "there will be cycles" or other implementation artifacts, nor "the undealiased types are desirable in error messages" which is valid but cosmetic, but whatever is the deeper objection. Because as far as I can see it, if there is a T from Foo[T] reachable in any way shape or form in the result of a whatever.asSeenFrom(Foo[Arg]) then when that T comes out it's going to be a bug. So I don't see the advantage of allowing it, ever. Which requires peeking inside type aliases, always.
If I were doing it from scratch, hypothetically speaking, 100% I'd keep both. It's not the kind of choice one should have to make.
If those are the only objections then please see the one-line patch proposed in #8223 (dealias more in InstantiateDependentMap) and the one here (dealias more in AsSeenFromMap.) Obviously this points toward "dealias more in TypeMap" as a possible one-patch-solves-all sort of thing. But I know that cycles will be a problem.
Aggressively dealiasing early in the piece also robs people of their abstractions:

```scala
class C {
  type T = Int
  def foo: T = 0
  def bar = foo
}
```

Here, we don't want to expose the Int in inferred the return type of `bar`.

Not saying that the proposed patches actually change that exact sample, but that's another thing we have to take care with.
I've been stepping through the ASF in my repl snippet above. It's pretty crazy. The first time around nothing changes, but the normalizeAliases in existential type that wraps up the ASF does another ASF via     
```scala
override def betaReduce = transform(sym.info.resultType) 
```

this method is pretty broken, since it ends up doing an ASF on a type (AIn) from a different owner (the refinement that defines A, whose info we're transforming). ASF assumes the clazz defines the symbol of the type we're asking it to relativize, so things go off the rails.
:-) /away bedtime

i'm very suspicious of the transform and the mis-aligned owners; we shouldn't be doing an tp.ASF(pre, clazz) only makes sense when tp.typeSymbol.owner isSubClass clazz
dumping my brain/debugging session:

```scala
trait Thing { type A }
trait View[AIn] {
  val in: Thing { type A = AIn }
  type Bla = in.A // 
}

val view = typeOf[View[Int]]
val bla = view.member(newTypeName("Bla"))

view.memberType(bla)

Here's a small accompaniment.
```scala
trait Boo {
  type A1 >: Int <: Int
  type A2 = Int
}
class Foo(val in: Boo) {
  type A1 = in.A1
  type A2 = in.A2

  type B1 = A1
  type B2 = A2
}
object Baz extends Foo(new Boo { })

/**

**/
```
Normalize isn't supposed to change abstract types (even those equivalent to aliases), so this looks correct to me:

```scala
scala> typeOf[Baz.type].members filter (_.isType) map (x => (x, typeOf[Baz.type] memberType x normalize) )
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details

scala> typeOf[Baz.type].members filter (_.isType) map (x => (x, (typeOf[Baz.type] memberType x normalize) bounds) )

res1: Iterable[($r.intp.global.Symbol, $r.intp.global.TypeBounds)] = List(

```
co-evolution == creation?

finally answered one of those cringe-inducing questions-to-self 
```scala
    override def coevolveSym(pre1: Type): Symbol =
      if (pre eq pre1) sym else (pre, pre1) match {
        // don't look at parents -- it would be an error to override alias types anyway
        case (RefinedType(_, _), RefinedType(_, decls1)) => decls1 lookup sym.name
        // TODO: is there another way a typeref's symbol can refer to a symbol defined in its pre?
        // yup: they could both be `SingleType`s with an underlying RefinedType
        case (preOrig, preNew) if preOrig.isStable && preNew.isStable => preNew.decls lookup sym.name 
```
#764 opened by mark harrah in april 2008. Nice.
@adriaan If you're evolving coevolution, perhaps you'll wind up fixing, or enabling a fix of, #6493 / https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2986
I spent all day on this, but I don't know how to generalize this fix. Clearly, the current approach is a hack.
Co-evolution should be pushed to AsSeenFromMap and SubstMap and only rebind symbols when going from TypeRef(pre, sym, args) 
to TypeRef(pre', sym', args'), where pre is now "discarded" and thus it makes no sense to refer to the symbols it defines.
We don't have this information in the current approach, so we can't fix the first half of #6493, which requires a broader approach to rebinding these symbols. neg/t4137.scala is a good example of where we don't want to rebind: A#EPC2 and B#EPC2 are both valid typerefs, so when you're doing an ASF that rewrite a this type from A to B, you still don't want to change EPC2 (the one defined in A) to the other EPC2 (the one defined in B). Maybe a check like pre1.typeSymbolDirect.isNonBottomSubclass(pre2.typeSymbolDirect) could work... it's still feels like it pushes the hack into no-go territory
Concretely, with a more liberal coevolveSym, we don't get both expected errors:

I think you're hitting the natural ceiling on the "copy and mutate" approach to coherence. These constructs are too complex and too poorly managed to tolerate an ad hoc copy-on-demand approach to maintaining different views of the same type. Imagine if you will:
```scala
@immutable abstract class Type
@immutable abstract class Prefix extends Type
@immutable final case class TypeView(seenFrom: Prefix, tpe: Type) extends Type
```
Until such a day arrives, everyone should be thankful for whatever scraps of correctness they can scavenge. I'll certainly be glad to get these particular scraps. I thank you for the effort, while simultaneously regretting the percentage of it which goes to the chase-the-mutable monkey gods for whom no sacrifice will ever be enough.
