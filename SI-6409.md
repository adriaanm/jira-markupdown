The reference to the original stream head is not released until the mapper function produces a non-empty stream. This can be a problem if the elements consume considerable memory, and the mapper returns a long chain of empy streams.

{code}
scala> def run[A](s: Stream[A]) = s.flatMap(_ => Stream.empty[Int])
run: [A](s: Stream[A])scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int]

scala> def bigElemts = Stream.range(1, 1000000).map(x => List.fill(1000)("big"))
bigElemts: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[List[java.lang.String]]

scala> run(bigElemts)
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
{code}

With Stream's head not being lazy, I'm not sure this can be solved. But at least would be nice to include a hint in the flatMap apidocs.
Note also if you are concerned that the above run method holds to the stream head:

{code}
scala> @scala.annotation.tailrec def len[A](s: Stream[A], acc: Int = 0): Int = if (s.isEmpty) acc else len(s.tail, acc + 1)
len: [A](s: Stream[A], acc: Int)Int

scala> len(bigElemts)
res3: Int = 999999

scala> len(bigElemts.flatMap(_ => Stream.empty[Int]))
   ... OOM
{code}

So it is flatMap holding to the head.
Your example code doesn't indicate that the above run method doesn't holds to the stream head because len method is a tail recursive and the tail recursive method jumps to beginning of the method and *rewrite* the corresponding parameter {{s}} when the method itself is called.

However, my previous comment was also wrong.  The reason of this problem is not that the run method holds to the stream head.
The reason of this problems is that flatMap continues to evaluate each thunk of Stream until non-empty sequence is produced.

In {{len(bigElemts)}}, because {{s}} is rewritten to its tail when calling {{len(s.tail, acc + 1)}}, memory leaks doesn't happen.
In {{len(bigElemts.flatMap(_ => Stream.empty[Int]))}}, all thunks ({{LIst.fill(1000)("big")}}) of {{bigElemts}}, the number of {{bigElemts}} is 1000000, is evaluated to big List.  Then, much memory is consumed.  The head of {{bigElemts}} cannot be released in the flatMap because {{bigElemts}} itself is *{{this}}* reference, which is not rewritable.
