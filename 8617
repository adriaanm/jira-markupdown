Please change the docs on {{raw}} to state that it is broken if it's not going to be fixed for .0.  The first thing I did with raw was not raw, which was (1) confusing given that there was no documentation and (2) would not inspire a lot of confidence in me for using a .0 release if I wasn't following the dev process and tried this early.
