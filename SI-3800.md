Under some circumstances, scalac throws 'Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: X @scala.annotation.unchecked.uncheckedVariance' with X being the annotated type. A'm attaching a sample.
adriaan, can you have a look? i tried adding to appliedType

{code}
      case AnnotatedType(annots, underlying, self) => AnnotatedType(annots, appliedType(underlying, args), self)
{code}

but then the example gives a type error which i think is worng.
slightly less bombastic test case:

{code}
class meh extends StaticAnnotation

class ALike[C]
class AFactory[CC[x] <: ALike[CC[x]]] {
  def aCompanion : AFactory[CC @meh]
}
{code}
(In r23083) closes SI-3800. strip annotations from type constructors when checking subtyping

appliedType goes under annotations.
removed some dead code in isSubtypeHK0.
