The problem is best illustrated in the REPL:
{code}
scala> List(1, 2, 3).toSet.subsets(2).map(_.toList)
res0: Iterator[List[Int]] = non-empty iterator

scala> List(1, 2, 3).toSet.subsets.map(_.toList)
<console>:8: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => x$1.toList)
              List(1, 2, 3).toSet.subsets.map(_.toList)
{code}

Note that doing this with Set(1, 2, 3) directly does not produce the issue.

Both Set.subsets and Set.subsets(Int) have the same return type so I don't see why the latter line should not compile.

Originally, I asked this as a [question on Stack Overflow|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27357353/scala-missing-parameter-type]
Duplicate of SI-7743. Unfortunately this is more a limitation than a bug: local type inference is working as specified but needs more programmer-provided type annotations when you have an compound expression like this one.
As someone points out on SO, overload resolution is your friend in this case.

Or anything that anything that induces type inference. Such as using `xs.to[Set]` as in SI-7743.

I think it's sufficient if the parameterless `subsets` were endowed with parens. (That seemed to work.)

Alternatively, or until then,

{code}
