This is related to SI-1806
First, i just spent an hour trying to workaround this issue, so I'd expect someone would really appreciate if protected statics were just treated as public.
Second, I got this error message:
"Access to protected variable staticReference not permitted because enclosing class object SpringWebApplication in package ui is not a subclass of object WebApplication in package navigator7 where target is defined var webApplication = if (WebApplication.staticReference == null) {"
here is the definition:
object SpringWebApplication extends WebApplication{ }
it really looks like it is a subclass, but the message tells me it is not.
Instead of this lengthy explanation, I would prefer to see some steps of how to work around the problem, e.g. "Use reflection or write a java wrapper to access this field, because scala does not allow accessing protected static members"
