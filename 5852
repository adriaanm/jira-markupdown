Pretty much expected.  It's within the realm of possibility that someday it will, after realizing that the flatten on Option is ineligible, find the flatten on Iterable available after implicitly converting Option.  But I wouldn't bet on it.  Option is never going to fit seamlessly in with the collections, since it isn't one.
