The scala REPL uses jansi.dll which needs msvcr90.dll from the c++ runtime libs.
Without it there is no history nor tab-completion available in the REPL. 
I suggest to mention in the installation instructions how to verify that msvcr90.dll is available and if not how to install it from Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86):

The analysis of this problem was done in the scala-user group discussion "No JLineReader in REPL": 
http://groups.google.com/group/scala-user/browse_thread/thread/5df0eb293817d08a/3b04ca8fe346869c#3b04ca8fe346869c
I'm hopeful this is a duplicate of #4703 (which was opened later but makes the issue clearer.) If this is in fact a completely distinct bug from that one, and keeping in mind that having extra tickets open will not get it fixed any faster, then please reopen this with more detail.
It is a different bug than #4703. This one is a missing MSVCR90.DLL dependency. 

I am not sure how prevalent systems with that missing dll are. I don't think the severity is major. 

I would suggest the following fix: if the exception (or root exception) on JLineReader instantiation has the following text *"This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect."*, then print *Downloading and installing the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package" may fix your issue.*

If you assign to me or to community, I would eventually find time to test and provide a patch to that effect. By that time we may have more feedback on how many are affected. There is a vote link in this issue tracker so people can up vote if they feel it's important.
