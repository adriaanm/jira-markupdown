In 2.8.1, there is a syntax error: 'case' expected but '}' found.
In scala-2.9.0.r24198, it compiles but instead raises a MatchError on execution. A compile error seems preferable to a guaranteed runtime exception. I guess this changed with changeset r23726 and Parsers.caseSeparated(). 
(In r24210) Fix for parser regression allowing 0-case match blocks.
Closes SI-4217, no review.
