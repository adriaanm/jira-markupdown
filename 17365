lines 483ff of Future.scala should become

{code}
        p complete (try {
          Success(boxedType(tag.runtimeClass).cast(t).asInstanceOf[S])
        } catch {
          case e: Exception => Failure(e)
        })
{code}

because passing Nothing as type argument makes tag.runtimeClass throw an Exception("Nothing is a bottom type, therefore its erasure does not return a value")). This is really bad because then the future is never completed, which is not really expected behavior of this method and thus might break legitimate programs.
