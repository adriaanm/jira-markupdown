For instance,
{code}
@inline final val is = Array(1,2,3)
{code}
would warn.

For constant vals, it says refs are replaced by the RHS.  If the `5` is really `5.0`, which do you use?

Maybe it's obvious and there are no loopholes.  Then you'd get

{code}
final val b: Byte = 42
final val c: Char = 'a' + 1
@inline final val b = (42: Byte)   // warn?
{code}
