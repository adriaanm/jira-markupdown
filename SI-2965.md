I use a heap of 2GB, but even so it doesn't take too long before I have to restart Eclipse because the garbage collections are unable to free any memory.

The memory usage was at about 1.5 GB when I closed all the projects and invoked the garbage collector. That didn't help much, so I took a heap dump. I'm attaching the exported csv.
A heap dump taken on an Eclipse instance with _all_ projects closed.
