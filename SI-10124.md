I am upgrading a few libraries to cross-build with Scala 2.12.1. The following project hangs indefinitely when compiling the test sources:

https://github.com/iem-projects/ScalaCollider-If/tree/SI-10124

To reproduce:

```scala
git clone https://github.com/iem-projects/ScalaCollider-If
cd ScalaCollider-If
git checkout SI-10124
sbt ++2.12.1 clean test
```

For me, this proceeds until

```scala

```

And never completes.
The critical file is `SuperColliderSpec.scala`, and I had to fix a source incompatibility when adding Scala 2.12.1: Line 82 `import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global` had to be removed because in Scala 2.12.1 the implicit is ambiguous, while it is *not* so under Scala 2.10 and 2.11. My guess is the compiler hangs due to implicit resolution.
