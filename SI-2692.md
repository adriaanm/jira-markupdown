Take the following class:

```scala
class Klass {

	var num1 = retrieve(1)

	var num2 = retrieve(1L)

	def retrieve(id: java.lang.Long) = {
		id
	}

	def retrieve(id: java.lang.Integer) = {
		id
	}
}
```

Latest Scala will complain with a compile-error:
```scala
src/main/scala/Klass.scala:8: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method retrieve in class Klass of type (id: java.lang.Integer)java.lang.Integer
and  method retrieve in class Klass of type (id: java.lang.Long)java.lang.Long
match argument types (Int)
        var num1 = retrieve(1)
                   ^
one error found
```

I should be obvious that retrieve(1) should call retrieve(id: java.lang.Integer) and therefore boxed to the Integer object, not Long
This is an (arguably not very nice) side-effect of Scala's notion of weak conformance between numeric value types (see ï¿½3.5.3 of the [http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/pdfs/ScalaReference.pdf Scala reference 2.8]). Weak conformance allows (amongst other things) to pass a lesser numeric value to a method that expects a bigger one:

```scala
def f(l: Long) = ...
f(1)
```

Autoboxing is defined in Scala as a serie of implicit methods in `scala.Predef` such as `int2Integer(x: Int):java.lang.Integer` or `long2Long(x: Long):java.lang.Long`. But because of weak conformance, an `Int` can be autoboxed both to Integer or Long, leading to the ambiguity above.

Weak conformance is very useful in many cases, and won't go away. The current implementation of autoboxing is elegant (reuses the existing implicit infrastructure) and works in most cases. Now, Martin and I agree that the example given in this ticket is unpleasant. Unfortunately, we fear that there is not much that can be done about it. If you think this is not true, we would be very interested in hearing about your idea in the form of a [http://www.scala-lang.org/sids SID].

Note that there is a workaround for your issue:

```scala
var num1 = retrieve(int2Integer(1))
var num2 = retrieve(long2Long(1L))
```
Isn't it possible to have a priority system that makes int2Integer be preferred to expanding int to long and then calling long2Long?

Roughly, it would work by imagining a graph where each "conversion step" is represented by an edge, and the compiler would pick the shortest path to something valid (in this case, ("call int2Int",) is length 1, while ("weak-conform int to long", "call long2Long") is length 2).

I believe that C++ has a similar mechanism for implicit conversions, which could be a source of inspiration.
