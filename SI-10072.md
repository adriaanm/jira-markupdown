The following snippet compiles under 2.11.8 but does not compile under 2.12:
{code}
trait Foo[@specialized(Double,AnyRef)T] extends IndexedSeq[T] {

  override def sum[@specialized(Double, AnyRef) B >: T](implicit num: Numeric[B]): B = {
    foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)
  }
}
{code}

Compilation error:
{code}
[error] Foo.scala:4: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : (Double, Double) => Double
[error]  required: (Double, T) => Double
[error]     foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)
[error]                            ^
{code}
For me, the snippet doesn't compile in 2.11.8. I actually get two errors in 2.11.8:

{noformat}
Test.scala:3: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (Double, <empty>.T) => Double
 required: (Double, T(in trait Foo)) => Double
    foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)
                           ^
Test.scala:3: error: type mismatch;
 found   : B(in method sum$mcD$sp)
 required: <empty>.B
    foldLeft(num.zero)(num.plus)
                      ^
{noformat}
Intermediate result: this is related to https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5284, which was fixed in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/755, i still have to spend some time to understand that change.

The example in this ticket compiles using {{-Ydelambdafy:inline}}, in which case the {{castType}} method introduced in the above PR casts the function instantiation (new anonfun) to the necessary type {{(Int, A) => Int}}.

This cast is not performed under {{-Ydelambdafy:method}}, where the {{Function}} survives until specialization and is not replaced by {{new anonfun}}. So "duplicators" attempts to re-typecheck {{(x: B, y: B) => $anonfun$sum(x, y)}} with expected type {{(Int, A) => Int}}, which then yields the type mismatch.
