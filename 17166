Here is the code that donâ€™t work (from scala-virtualized-tutorial sample)
```scala
  object Example extends EmbedJS with JSCodeGen { 
    trait Boy[A] extends JSObj {                       // this works fine
      val name: String
      val age: A
    }
    class Girl(val name: String, val age: Int) extends JSObj   // this compiles by doesn't work
    
    def prog = {
      var kim = new Boy[Int] { val name = "kim"; val age = 20 } // Ok
      kim.age = 21
      var ann = new Girl("Ann", 20)                                          // looks like it is not reified at runtime
      var allowedDrink = if (kim.age >= 21) "beer" else "milk"
      var allowedDrink2 = if (ann.age >= 21) "beer" else "milk"

      document.getElementById("drink").innerHTML = allowedDrink + "," + allowedDrink2
    }
  }
```

And here is an exception i get at runtime while the compiler is completely fine with this code
```scala
function prog() Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: org.scala_lang.virtualized.js.Test$Example$Girl cannot be cast to org.scala_lang.virtualized.CoreExps$Exp
```
