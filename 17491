The update method updates the collection and after that it sends an `Update` message containing the new element. In my subscriber I want to get the old element so that I can handle it's removal.

In theory I could use `undo` to trigger an `Update` event for the old element, then `undo` again to set the new element back. As you can see that would get messy very quickly.

I can not think of a proposal that would not (potentially) break existing code.
