As an example, it's not fun (nor particularly easy) to need to escape these characters oneself.
```scala
val rel = group.replaceAllIn(template, (gm: Regex.Match) => m.groups(gm.group(1)).text.replaceAll("""\\""", """\\\\""").replaceAll("""\$""", """\\\$"""))
```

I propose that for this overload, the escaping is done by scala.
