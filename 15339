In the following, the implicit is selected despite requiring a prefix because of the local shadowing.

{code}
class A
class B

trait S {
    implicit def aToB(a: A): B = new B
}

class T extends S {
    def x: B = {
        val aToB = 3
        // doesn't compile, because aToB method requires 'T.this.' prefix
        //aToB(new A)
        
        // compiles, using T.this.aToB,
        //   despite it not being accessible without a prefix
        new A
    }
}
{code}

As I understand it, Section 7.2 of the spec says that the first part of implicit resolution finds implicits accessible without a prefix.  Ch. 2 says that a local identifier shadows an inherited identifier because it has the same precedence but is in an inner scope, which is why `aToB(new A)` doesn't compile.  Therefore, `S.aToB` should not be considered for implicit resolution.

The same behavior occurs when defining `aToB` directly in `T` or importing an implicit named `aToB` (say, from an `object P`).  Putting `implicit` in front of the local `val aToB` shows the expected behavior of not selecting the `S.aToB` implicit, giving a compile error.
