=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Looking at ScalaDoc.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
All methods should be documented.

=== Additional information ===
As we have now "real" source files, it should be easier to add documentation to these classes.
I guess the current docu gets its right in one key point, where it says: "by the underlying host system."

Some details apply to both JVM and CLR (e.g. min/max values), others less so (exceptions upon overflow on CLR depend on whether checked mode is in use), and a discussion of the connection between Char and Unicode leads to the APIs for Unicode on each platform. 

Want to contribute a patch, for JVM/JDK? Then the CLR/.NET Framework story can also be added. Only then will the docu be "complete".
