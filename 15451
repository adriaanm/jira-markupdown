Class util.Random does not define shuffle method - the shuffle method is defined only in the companion object. This makes it impossible to shuffle a collection with a user initialized, non-default Random instance, e.g. to obtain repeatable results with every run of the program. 

If there is no other important reason why this method is defined in the companion object only, I suggest moving it to the definition of the Random class. Then the following assertion would compile and pass:

assert (new util.Random(0) shuffle List(1,2,3,4) ==
        new util.Random(0) shuffle List(1,2,3,4))
