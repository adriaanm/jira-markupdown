I have this piece of code
```scala
trait Bound {
  private val support = new PropertyChangeSupport()
  
  def firePropertyChange(name:String, oldVal:Object, newVal:Object) = support.firePropertyChange(name, oldVal, newVal)
}
```

I realized that I used a constructor which is NOT present in the java class. How is that possible ? A decompile yielded:
```scala
    public static void $init$(Bound $this)
    {
        $this.scala$test$Bound$_setter_$scala$test$Bound$$support_$eq(new PropertyChangeSupport(BoxedUnit.UNIT));
    }
```

So it seems the compiler tried to match the Object constructor with a default unit. Is this the proper behavior ?
How can a programmer know that this substitution is happening ?
