I agree with the original invalid resolution, since the behavior is as specified for the conformance relation (3.5.2).  There is a special case for allowing a parameterless method to override a method with an empty parameter list, but this is just for overriding and not conformance.

Related, I don't see what in the spec allows you to do the opposite and override a method with an empty parameter list with a parameterless method, but the compiler doesn't complain:
```scala
scala> class A { def x: Int = 3 }
defined class A

scala> class B extends A { override def x(): Int = 4 }
defined class B
```
