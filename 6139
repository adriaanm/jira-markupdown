The following looks like it may be yet another manifestation of the same problem:
{code}
trait T extends DelayedInit {
  def delayedInit(body: => Unit) = {
    println("In delayedInit")
    body
  }
}
val f = {(p1: Int) => new T{println(p1)}}
f(5)
{code}

In 2.10.3, this fails with 'error: symbol value p1$1 does not exist in $anonfun$1$$anon$1$delayedInit$body.apply'

I encountered this when trying to use a Specs2 After context with a data table.
