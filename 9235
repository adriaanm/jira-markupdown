```
 Notice the usage of Any, which is kind-polymorphic, a code phrase which means "there will be bugs" in the mother tongue
```

{{Any}} is a bit of a red herring there, the for type checking higher kinded types, expected kind is sneakily encoded an expected type (ie {{pt}}). In that encoding, the return type is unused.

What happens is that we have a higher kinded type ref encoded (again) as an `AliasTypeRef` without args. This can't be dealiased, the only way to reveal anything further is via `etaExpand` (which is behind `normalize` for these.

For example:
```scala
type L[X] = Any
// <L>.dealias eq <L>
// <L>.etaExpand == <[X]Any>
```

I'm not sure what conclusions to draw from all of this. Maybe a split `AliasTypeRef` into a HK and regular version?

I'm running a test now to see with:
```scala
    final def typeParamsMatchArgs  = if (typeParamsMatchArgs0) true
                                     else if (isHigherKinded && args.isEmpty) false
                                     else { debugwarn(s"$this.typeParamsMatchArgs = false for non-higher-kinded type"); false}
```

to see if there are any ground type refs that that get into this spot.
