(In r22508) closes scala/bug#2331: the pre-transform in Erasure did not correctly recurse in the case of a TypeApply.

It simply returned the function, which might very well have been, say, a Select node, which had to be erased in case the qualifier's type is a refinement.

(sorry about the whitespace changes)
