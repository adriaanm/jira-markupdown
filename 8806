Also, in case the dimensions of this aren't yet apparent, adriaan your example makes it appear more of a corner case than it is. You don't need a hidden type parameter. All you need is a scrutinee with type Any.
{code}
case class Concrete[A](havoc: A => A)
object Test extends App {
  (Concrete((x: Int) => x): Any) match { case Concrete(f) => f("not what you'd expect") }
}
{code}
