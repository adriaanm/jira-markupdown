From the Iterator docs:
```scala
 *  It is of particular importance to note that, unless stated otherwise, ''one should never
 *  use an iterator after calling a method on it''. The two most important exceptions
 *  are also the sole abstract methods: `next` and `hasNext`.
```

So, after you call `takeWhile`, all bets are off.
