**Steps to reproduce the bug**
 1. Create a Scala class A in a file A.scala
 2. Comment out the class definition and save the file
 3. In another file (say B.scala) create a package named _A_ with a package block ({{package A { }}})

Saving the file *B.scala* produces a compilation error saying "A is already defined as object A". To remove this message we have to delete the file *A.scala* (where class A was defined). The same bug can be reproduced if the deleted class and the package were in the same file.

Tested with Eclipse 3.5.1 and SDT r20518.
