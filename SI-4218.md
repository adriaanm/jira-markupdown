=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
Methods of an anonymous class are sometimes made private. Check the following code which differs only in that in one case the instance of an anonymous class is assigned to a value before returning - resulting in a different class signature:
{code}
object Test {
	def main(args: Array[String]) {
		val res1 = test1();
		val res2 = test2();
		
		assert(res1.getClass.getMethod("getTest") != null);
		assert(res2.getClass.getMethod("getTest") != null);
	}
	
	def test1() : AnyRef = {
		val tmp = new AnyRef {
			def getTest = "Hello";
		};
		tmp
	}

	def test2() : AnyRef = {
		new AnyRef {
			def getTest = "Hello";
		}
	}
}
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The methods of the anonymous inner class in test2() to be public.


=== What do you see instead? ===
2 anonymous classes having the same code resulting in different signatures.

=== Additional information ===
Executing the code above should be enough.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: 1.6.0_20
  - Operating system: Windows 7
Because martin's novella on this subject was nominated for several prestigious commenting awards, I enclose it here.
{code}
// This is very tricky stuff, because we are navigating
// the Skylla and Charybdis of anonymous classes and what to return
// from them here. On the one hand, we cannot admit
// every non-private member of an anonymous class as a part of
// the structural type of the enclosing block. This runs afoul of
// the restriction that a structural type may not refer to an enclosing
// type parameter or abstract types (which in turn is necessitated
// by what can be done in Java reflection. On the other hand,
// making every term member private conflicts with private escape checking
// see ticket SI-3174 for an example.
// The cleanest way forward is if we would find a way to suppress
// structural type checking for these members and maybe defer 
// type errors to the places where members are called. But that would
// be a big refactoring and also a  big departure from existing code.
// The probably safest fix for 2.8 is to keep members of an anonymous
// class that are not mentioned in a parent type private (as before)
// but to disable escape checking for code that's in the same anonymous class.
// That's what's done here. 
// We really should go back and think hard whether we find a better
// way to address the problem of escaping idents on the one hand and well-formed
// structural types on the other.
