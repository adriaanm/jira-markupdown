In the following example, the pattern match against `FooBar` is not correctly propagated to the case body, producing a compiler error:

Preparation:

{code}
sealed trait Bar[S] {
  def system: S
}

trait Foo { def bar(): Unit }

trait FooBar extends Bar[Foo]
{code}

Example:

{code}
trait Test[S] {
  val bar: Bar[S]

  bar match {
    case fb: FooBar => fb.system.bar() // error
    case _ =>
  }
}
{code}

The error here is: "error: value bar is not a member of _2"

The following shows that the type is actually accepted by the compiler:

{code}
case fb: FooBar => (fb: FooBar).system.bar()
{code}

A different perspective:

{code}
sealed trait Bar[S] {
  def system: S
}

trait Foo { def bar(): Unit }

trait FooBar extends Bar[Foo]

trait Test[S] {
  val bar: Bar[S]

  def blip(fb0: Bar[S] with FooBar) {
    val sys = fb0.system
    sys.bar()
  }
}
{code}
In that example, the compiler can't unify {{Bar[S] with FooBar}}, because it is perfectly legal to represent uninhabited types as in:

{code}
scala> trait M[A]; trait N extends M[Int]
defined trait M
defined trait N

scala> type T = M[String] with N
defined type alias T
{code}

In the pattern matching context, we know that the type {{Bar[S] with FooBar}} is inhabited (because we got there by virtue of pattern matching on a value.) But I'm not sure how to exploit this.
Re how to exploit this, exploiting this is what propagateKnownTypes does.
{noformat}
[log typer] Checking checkability of (x: Bar[S]) against pattern FooBar
[P1] false  X <: P             // Bar[S]  <: FooBar
[P2] false  x ? P              // (x ? Bar[S]) ? (x ? FooBar)
[P3] true   XR <: P            // FooBar <: FooBar
[P4] false  None of the above  // !(P1 || P2 || P3)
[log typer] !(FooBar <:< Bar[S]), but after propagateKnownTypes we find (FooBar <:< FooBar) - pattern inference improved
{noformat}
However it's not enough by itself, because the selection on foo.system still comes up with _1 as its type. I'm not sure who to blame. Given invariant Foo[T], a value, and the knowledge that the value is both a Foo[Bar] and a Foo[Quux], all scala can come up with is that the value is
{noformat}
Foo[_1] forSome { type _1 >: glb(Bar, Quux) <: lub(Bar, Quux) }
{noformat}
This seems far too weak. AFAICS _1 should be both lower and upper bounded by glb(Bar, Quux), in other words no matter what the _1 in Foo[_1] is, it has to be <: Bar and it has to be <: Quux. And indeed changing the calculation in that fashion makes everything in this ticket start compiling. But things can't be done that way in general - if the above description is accurate, it's only accurate when the types you are folding are known to be inhabited by the same value. There would have to be a different facility for calculating this.

Well, I do and I don't. At least I understand the situation. This:
{code}
trait Foo { def f: M1 }
trait Bar { def f: M2 }

object Test {
  def f1(x: Foo) = x match { case y: Bar => y.f }
}
{code}
The pattern matcher types y as "Bar", not as anything intersecting Foo and Bar, as that would require it to do something more sophisticated to resolve collisions than ignoring them. I am not sure this aspect of the language can be fixed.
