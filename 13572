scala -classpath classes SomeObject
does not behave the same as
java -classpath xxx/lib/scala-library.jar:classes SomeObject
when you attempt to change a Formatter to a non JDK Formatter -- for example a custom formatter in the classes directory.

This seems to be the same as scala/bug#50 "Classloader trouble", but may only be superficially similar.

It seems that JDK classes cannot load non-JDK classes with scala(1).
