This program is correctly rejected with a variance error in scala 2.7.7. And then it is accepted by 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10.
{code}
trait Family[+Base] { type Family = Base }
{code}
I fixed it in a419799f87 at which point it returned to being an error. But it will assuredly break code to change it suddenly. I found it because this not-small project

 https://github.com/ReifyIt/basis

is essentially built around exploiting the bug. And I wasn't able to make uncheckedVariance work on an abstract type member - is it possible? The upshot is that just getting it back to compiling will require touching almost every file in the project, and that's assuming it doesn't have to be redesigned entirely given the far-reaching consequences.

So I don't know what the policy is, but based on past decisions maybe you don't want to roll this out so suddenly. At the very least it warrants an explanatory message, or maybe an opt-in -Yunsafe-variance option.
{code}
scala> trait Family[+Base] { type Family = Base }
<console>:7: error: covariant type Base occurs in invariant position in type Base of type Family
       trait Family[+Base] { type Family = Base }
                                  ^

scala> trait Family[+Base] { type Family = (Base @annotation.unchecked.uncheckedVariance) }
defined trait Family
{code}

Isn't this enough? We could disable the new check behind -Xsource:2.10 (I did that already for a few similarly strengthened checks.)
If you're looking for 2.10 code which doesn't compile, another many-time offender is:
{code}
 -  implicit def Byte(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomByte
 +  implicit def Byte(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomByte()(S)

 -  def PositiveByte(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomPositiveByte
 +  def PositiveByte(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomPositiveByte()(S)

 -  def ByteBelow(upper: Byte)(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomByteBelow(upper)
 +  def ByteBelow(upper: Byte)(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomByteBelow(upper)(S)

 -  def ByteBetween(lower: Byte, upper: Byte)(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomByteBetween(lower, upper)
 +  def ByteBetween(lower: Byte, upper: Byte)(implicit S: Random): Arbitrary[Byte] = new RandomByteBetween(lower, upper)(S)
{code}
I already WTFed that on one of the mailing lists when I first discovered it.

Because otherwise,
{code}
[error] /s/basis/stat/src/main/scala/basis/stat/Arbitrary.scala:61: ambiguous implicit values:
[error]  both method Random in package stat of type => basis.stat.Random
[error]  and value S of type basis.stat.Random

[error]                                                           ^
[error] one error found
{code}

Indeed, this changed:

{code}
package p {
  class Foo
  object `package` {
    implicit val foo: Foo = new Foo
  }

  object Test {
    def bar(implicit f: Foo): Any = implicitly[Foo]
  }
}
{code}

I think I remember why:

    SI-6667 Abort after any ambiguous in-scope implicit

    Rather than continuing on to a search of implicits
    of the expected type.

    Previously, the companion implicits were searched if the
    the caller was running the implicit search in silent
    mode, for example if searching for an implicit parameter
    in an application which has an expected type.

    After this commit, the behaviour is consistent, regardless
    on silent/non-silent typing.

Failing is a lesser WTF than 2.10.3 which fell back to the implicit in the companion-scope (which includes package objects of the prefixes of the sought type, unfortunately!)

Package object implicits: just say no!
Here's another one. This works in 2.10 because FunctionClass contains ClassSymbols. It seems to have been downgraded to Symbols.

I did partly mean "seq?" like that, but I also meant that I don't see it in 2.10.3 or current master. Although I don't know you meant "2.10.3" for the "before" in "before and after".
