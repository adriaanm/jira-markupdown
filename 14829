Scala reports type errors when using the org.json.simple.JSONObject class, probably because it is decalred as a raw HashMap:

scala> val o = new org.json.simple.JSONObject()  
o: org.json.simple.JSONObject = {}

scala> o.put("a",1)
<console>:6: error: overloaded method value put with alternatives (K,V)V <and> ((K with K,_2)_2) forSome { type _2 >: V with V } cannot be applied to (java.lang.String,Int)
       o.put("a",1)

Scala should however not prevent the use of this library, as it's working fine with pure Java.
