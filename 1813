Aside from the junit issue (or non-issue), why is _this_ issue closed? Isn't it still the case that the plugin is not resolving the eclipse M2_REPO variable (or any eclipse classpath variable) prior to invoking the compiler? In my case, the M2_REPO variable is configured correctly, and jars they point to do indeed exist. That the compiler is crashing due the plugin not sending the resolved path the jars seems to be orthogonal to the compiler problem. Or do you believe that I have configured something incorrectly within eclipse?
