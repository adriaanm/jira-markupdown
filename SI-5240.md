I have a project in java (JaCoP http://sourceforge.net/projects/jacop-solver/) that I add scala wrapper for creating DSL. The scala code contains a number of classes and a package object. Compilation of this scala code works correct the first time but the second time, when doing changes in the code, it reports the following two errors:

error: type _$1 is defined twice
error: type _$1 is defined twice

It does not give any suggestion on possible error :( Cleaning the project and generating once more the code works correct again.

I can send the whole code on request but it is rather big. I send for you scala files that work with current version of JaCoP. Everything is on sourceforge.
