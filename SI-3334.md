```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> val xml = <foo>bar</foo>
xml: scala.xml.Elem = <foo>bar</foo>

scala> val x2 = xml.map(i => i)
x2: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<foo>bar</foo>)

scala> x2 == xml
res0: Boolean = false

scala> xml == x2
res1: Boolean = false
```

Old behavior:
```scala
scala> val xml = <foo>bar</foo>
xml: scala.xml.Elem = <foo>bar</foo>

scala> val x2 = xml.map(i => i)
x2: scala.xml.NodeSeq = <foo>bar</foo>

scala> x2 == xml
res0: Boolean = true
```
"Broken" is what it was before.  You left the last line off your old behavior transcript:
```scala
scala> xml == x2
res1: Boolean = false
```
As far as I'm concerned, if we're stuck with this idea of "universal" equality and one == method which takes an Any, then the absolute minimum requirement for the standard library is that it not be internally inconsistent.  That way people who want an inconsistent equals can implement it on top of a consistent one; however there is no way to implement a consistent one on top of an inconsistent one.

As mentioned elsewhere the old behavior is still available in xml_==.
```scala
scala> x2 xml_== xml
res0: Boolean = true

scala> xml xml_== x2
res1: Boolean = false
```
So to the extent I have anything to say about it, this is wontfix.
This is a little more illuminating:
```scala
scala> val x1 = <foo>bar</foo>
x1: scala.xml.Elem = <foo>bar</foo>

scala> val x2 = x1.map( i => i)
x2: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<foo>bar</foo>)

scala> x2.getClass
res41: java.lang.Class[_] = class scala.xml.NodeSeq$$$$anon$$1

scala> x1.getClass
res42: java.lang.Class[_] = class scala.xml.Elem

scala> x2(0)
res43: scala.xml.Node = <foo>bar</foo>

scala> x1 == x2(0)
res44: Boolean = true

scala> x2(0) == x1  
res45: Boolean = true

scala> 
```
So really it looks like the behavior of map has changed, not the behavior of equals.
