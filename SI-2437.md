As with Eclipse 3.5, Eclipse supports a "Configure" menu to handle project-related things like Adding and removing natures. This should be the way to go for the Scala plugin to not clutter the project context menu too much.

See http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/02/08/tip-the-configure-menu/ and https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=231611 for more information on that topic.
(In r21352) Fixes #2437. Thanks to Matt Russell for the patch. Review by community.
