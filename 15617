An attempt to add elements to a DoubleLinkedList results in an empty list. An example code follows. The system crashes when the list is initialized as, for example, new DoubleLinkedList[Int] (0, new DoubleLinkedList[Int] ).

It was tested with scala 2.8

object ex extends Application { final.

  import scala.collection.mutable.DoubleLinkedList

  var t = new DoubleLinkedList[Int] 

  t :+= 1
  t :+= 2

  println(t)
}
