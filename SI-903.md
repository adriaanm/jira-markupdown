we know this is invalid statement because val is immuable, so += doesn't work.
{code}
val x = 1
x += 1
{code}

But the error given at runtime is mis leading to user:
{code}
scala> val x += 1
scala> x: Int = 1
scala> x += 1
scala> <console>:8: error: value += is not a member of Int
       x += 1
         ^
{code}
Can't we just say val is immutable and += can't be use?

But the following works, even though `s` is immutable:

{code}
scala> val s = collection.mutable.Set(1, 2, 3)
s: scala.collection.mutable.Set[Int] = Set(3, 1, 2)

scala> s += 2
{code}

..and would fail on an `immutable.Set`. And that really is because method `+=` is not found, not because `s` is a `val`.

What could be a better message that handles both cases?
