(In r24068) The AnyVal types become source files instead of polite
compiler fictions.

!! You'll need a serious "ant all.clean" now. !!

As of this commit the system is fully bootstrapped and the
synthetic code eliminated: only the source files remain.
The sort-of-AnyVal-companions in scala.runtime.* have all
been eliminated because the actual companions can do everything;
deprecated vals in the scala.runtime package object point to
the companions.  This left AnyValCompanion as the only AnyVal
related thing in the runtime package: that made little sense,
so I deprecated and moved it as well.

Starr is based on r24066 plus this commit.  Closes SI-4121.
