```scala

    def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      println("It's us chickens")
    }

```

It's us chickens

After java boot/extdirs classpath has 1 entries:
  directory classpath: .
```
(extempore in [r25452](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25452)) Attacked classpaths to get "." off of it when it's not actually
specified. The commit makes me nervous, but there's no invisible way to
fix something like this.

 ** Attention, this commit changes classpath handling **

We desperately need some way of testing that the classpath has
certain qualities and does not have others; partest is not that way.
Closes #4857, no review.
Ow, this bit me today. Is there a workaround?  (And if there's a list somewhere of candidates for inclusion in 2.9.2, I hope this is on it.)

Note that scaladoc is affected too.
In addition to being a correctness problem, this is also a performance problem in that it can potentially take a long time for the compiler to recursively descend the entire subtree of the current directory, looking for any and all class files.
fwiw, in the case of Scaladoc I was able to work around this by patching my local copy of the scaladoc shell script to pass -Dscala.usejavacp=false instead of -Dscala.usejavacp=true (it isn't enough to override it in JAVA_OPTS since that comes earlier in the command line)
