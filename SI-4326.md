=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
  // Call the following from multiple running threads,
  // all sharing the same instance of synchronizedQueue.
  val optVal = synchronizedQueue.dequeueFirst(someBoolFun)
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
This should either return Some(value), or None.  If Some(value), the value returned should be removed from the queue, and not given to any other caller.

=== What do you see instead? ===
Because this method is not synchronized in SynchronizedQueue, it occasionally returns Some(null) due to a race condition.  It should be guarded in the same manner as the other synchronized overridden methods.

=== Additional information ===
It is probable that dequeueAll() and many other methods in this class would also benefit from added guards.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: Oracle 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: Ubuntu 10.10 running on Intel 64-bit
