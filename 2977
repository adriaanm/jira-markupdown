In r21627:

Yes, it looks like that example works now.  It doesn't work if A and B are in packages, however.  For example:

A.scala
{code}
package a
object A {
  val x = 3
}
{code}
B.scala:
{code}
package b
object B {
  val y = 5
}
{code}

and after the first compilation, change B.scala to:
{code}
package b
object B {
  val y = a.A.x
}
{code}
