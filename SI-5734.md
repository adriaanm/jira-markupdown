In the attached file, the ForkJoinPool-worker 4 thread has locked the TcpService and is trying to establish a connection (which, for whatever reason), is blocking. This means that no other remote communication can occur - in particular ForkJoinPool-1-Worker-0 is blocked on sending a response to a separate actor.

This essentially takes down an entire actor-based system.
This may be related to another issue I reported: #4942
