It's currently not possible to define companion objects for inner classes and refer to them without having an instance of the outer class.

Since there should be a way to achieve something like statics on inner classes as well (the spec suggests that with [companion] objects java statics can be achieved, Chapter 5.4, example 5.4.1), I'd suggest the following syntax:

```scala
object TestComponent {
  object TestService {
    final val TESTSTRING = "TestString"
  }
}

trait TestComponent {
  trait TestService {
  }
}
```

ATM, this doesn't compile due to a name clash within object and trait. This should treat objects within companion objects as the companion objects of classes nested within the class linked to the companion object.

The corresponding Java syntax is as follows:

```scala
public interface TestComponent {
  public interface TestService {
    public final String TESTSTRING = "TestString";
  }
}
```

I fear that would be too complicated. Companion objects are meant to model the capabilities of Java statics. This goes far beyond that. The proposed change would also introduce ambiguities. Given
```scala
object TestComponent {
  object TestService {
    final val TESTSTRING = "TestString"
  }
  trait TestService {}
}

trait TestComponent {
  trait TestService {
  }
}
```
would object TestService now be a companion object of both traits?

This isn't ambigous since you can't define a trait TestService in object and trat/class at the same time! This leads to a name clash as it does with object at the moment.
The ambiguity argument is valid -- The code I gave compiles without problems.

The whole request is something that requires a LOT of work. Java never even considered the analogue (statics for inner classes). The EPFL team does not have the resources to do this. If someone wants to do a SIP and an implementation, fine. We'll consider an integration, based on the strengths of the SIP. But it has no place as a ticket.
