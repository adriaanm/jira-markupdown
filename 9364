Jason, what you say makes a lot of sense, but
1) compilers are never supposed to crash, just to report errors
2) also, the ScalaReference explicitly says that '$' counts as an uppercase letter.

Still, the parser could reject such identifiers, starting from 2.11, couldn't it? **If** they are actually unsupported, do not work and are not used, that should be OK.
