Regarding ticket SI-3974, one favored practice to deal with dynamic calls involves: 

a) know where they occur: {{-Ylog:cleanup -Ydebug}}

b) manually create a named class/interface, and use that as the explicit return type of the expression instead of a refinement type. 


Should the refactoring in (b) above be part of the compiler, or is it for lint? In some cases a block-local class would be added, othertimes a template-level one (with the same visibility as the LHS of the assignment?). And, after adding a named type (before {{CleanUp}}) retyping is needed. Any cons other than that?
