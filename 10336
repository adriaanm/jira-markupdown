I think there is a double mistake here.

1) the fact that reordering imports can change compilation success is a different issue than the original one.
2) Jason showed that the effect of SI-3346 on my code can be countered by removing sortBy in Implicits.scala, hence there is no need to revert that change.

In support of 1), removing sortBy does not fix compilation failure on the first occurrence (i.e. when int2string is moved after coef2rf). It does fix failure on the second occurence.

Regarding my code, I have found a workaround of my own, but yours may be good too, I have to check it.

Still, I think this bug (the original one, causing failure on the second identical line) is worth fixing (and simple to fix, see https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3408 about how removing sortBy has no effect on performance). Hence I have created a new pull request https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3540
