I hit this long time ago but I couldn't minimize it on my code (I think I sent stacktrace to you, Adriaan, but without the code so it was useless). 
So now I experimented a bit and here is pretty dummy generator for the example:
{code}
object bugGenerator {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("trait Foo{")
    println("abstract class Base")
    val max = 2000
    for (x <- Range(0, max)) println("case class Dummy" + x + "(x: Int) extends Base")
    println("def test(y: Base) = y match {")
    for (x <- Range(0, max)) println(" case Dummy" + x + "(p) => p")
    println("}\n}")
  }
}
{code}

starts crashing somewhere between 1000 and 2000, even with "-Dscalac.patmat.analysisBudget=off" (apart from the fact that it takes long to compile).
