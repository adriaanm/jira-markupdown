On the one hand, we don't pickle positions. On the other hand, we can't even read the SourceFile classfile attribute via official API in java.lang.Class. This means that it's currently impossible to use reflection API to figure out the source file and line number where a symbol was defined.

I think the best solution here would be to pickle symbol positions. Hopefully, a relative file + a long wouldn't increase the size of our classfiles much.

Relative to what?

Also, I'll lower the priority of this issue. Critical seems to be a little bit too high.
I see. Makes sense.

I don't think you can read any of class file attributes using reflection (including {{SourceFileAttribute}}).
