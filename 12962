I have been using matching for command line args in a simple utility I wrote and with 2.6.1 the matching breaks. The code looks like:
```scala
def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = args match {
  case Array(user,pass) => { ... }
  case Array(user) => { ... }
  case _ => { ...usage, exit ... }
}
```

This used to work, but now if I run the app with an empty command line I get an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception on the first attempted match (Array(user,pass)).
