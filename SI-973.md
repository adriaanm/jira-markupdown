At the moment, the new Eclipse plugin doesn't seem to allow for multiple source directories.  To clarify, it allows them, but does not actually compile the additional sources (it takes the first directory and no other).  This is a critical feature for me as I often separate things like test classes from the rest of the framework for purposes of organization.

As an aside, multiple source directories must be compiled simultaneously, otherwise circular dependencies between the dirs would be impossible.
Actually, this seems to be working fine in the latest builds of the plugin.  It is worth noting though that I use Buildr to generate the project fully formed with multiple source dirs, I never really test with a purely plugin setup anymore.

Anyway, this bug could be closed as "fixed" buy it's up to you guys.  Works for me! :-)
