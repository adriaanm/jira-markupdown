Just trying to understand the type command in REPL.

Maybe there are still some corner cases. I did follow #7132.

```scala
scala> :type def i = 8
=> Int

scala> :type val i = 9
Int

scala> :type val i = 9 ; val j = 8
=> Int <and> => Int

scala> :type -v val i = 9 ; val j = 8
// Type signature
=> Int <and> => Int

// Internal Type structure
OverloadedType(
  alts = List(
    NullaryMethodType(
      TypeRef(TypeSymbol(final abstract class Int extends AnyVal))
    )
    NullaryMethodType(
      TypeRef(TypeSymbol(final abstract class Int extends AnyVal))
    )
  )
)
```
Feature idea, paste the last thing, including what I typed:
```scala
scala> :type val i = { println("hi"); 7 }
Int
// ok, that's what I want, go ahead and do it
scala> :paste -
hi
i: Int = 7
```

I thought it wasn't supposed to evaluate, by the way, so maybe I'm missing something in the nomenclature:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.0-20131018-072258-54707cb450 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_25).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :type val i = { println("hi"); 7 }
hi
Int
```
