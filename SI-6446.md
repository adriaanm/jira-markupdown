When my fancy plugin component is added to phases, nobody knows what it can do. OK, I see -Xplugin-list.  But if my plugin installs multiple components, it would be nice to see what they do in -Xshow-phases. Plus, it makes a third-party component feel like a first-class citizen of the ecosystem.

As a footnote, one of the dropdowns in "create issue" changed priority from major to blocker, I swear. I reloaded the page to clear it.
I just realized that any PR, no matter how trivial or complex, is at risk of being preempted by paulp resurrecting a dormant branch.
