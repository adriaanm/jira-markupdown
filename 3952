We already discussed this on StackOverflow. My point is that it would make the Scala spec more complicated (and potentially break existing code). Currently the spec says
{code}
X += Y
{code}
is compiled to X.+=(Y), or failing this, X = X + Y. Compare how much more complicated the proposed definition is. I am very much against making Scala more complicated, so this is a won't fix, and that's a final decision.
