Already wrote about this in the scala list and as a followup, Ingo asked me to create this ticket:

The scala.swing.UIElement needs a wrapper for java.awt.Component's setName() method. The main use I see for this property is for easy identification of components during automated GUI tests.

Thanks.
(In r21287) Fixed SI-2803. Added warning for UIElement.cachedWrapper.
