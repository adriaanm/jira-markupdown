High on our todo list is to add a config option to let you filter out warnings. Hopefully in 2.11.1.

There is a tension between adding a -Yoption for each warning (maximum flexibility) vs lumping many warnings under `Xlint` (easier discoverability, smaller command line API).

In the meantime, you can do this yourself in SBT. I remember I helped @puffnfresh configure this a month or so ago. I'll try to dig up the example.
