From PR validation (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4376#issuecomment-90305927):
```
That assertion error is the same one that @gkossakowski's encountered while working on the SBT build. When we also saw it during PR validation, I added (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4397) an extended diagnostic error to the assertion in the hope we would see it again.

Now, to make sense of this:
```
```
[quick.compiler] error: symbol value x2#803320 does not exist in scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.ContextErrors$TyperContextErrors$TyperErrorGen.AdaptTypeError, which contains locals value x1#803317,value foundType#508052,value req#508050,value found#508049,value tree#508048
