Yes, I collectly agree with you.
Stream's laziness isn't specified by any documents. We should not assume many assumption(contract) of methods.

I think that almost **early evaluation** is caused by unnecessary GenTraversableLike#tail method calling.
It is good to remove such method calling for other classes without need **unnecessary** method calliing, maybe such class dosen't exist.
