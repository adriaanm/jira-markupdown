This algorithm is not correct.  It does not produce the same output on e.g. `"abbbc".combinations(2)`, due to using `distinct` to start with.  Just dropping `distinct` won't do it either, since then you'll get duplicates.  I don't see a trivial way to solve this problem with this algorithm.

A faster implementation is welcome, but it has to produce the same behavior as the existing method.  Feel free to open a new bug if a faster algorithm is found.
