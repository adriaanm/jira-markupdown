There are two sides to the problem:
1. Detecting function-wide synchronized(this) and marking it on the method symbol - should be done early on, in a phase that manipulates trees
2. Avoiding the boxing and unboxing - scalac -optimize does the job properly:
```scala
public boolean f();
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	dup
   2:	astore_1
   3:	monitorenter
   4:	aload_0
   5:	monitorexit
   6:	iconst_0
   7:	ireturn
   8:	aload_1
   9:	monitorexit
   10:	athrow
```
