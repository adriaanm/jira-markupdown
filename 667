the issue is:
 - The scala compiler reads the 1.5 java library, even when targetting 1.4
 - In 1.5, {{StringBuffer}} extends the private class {{AbstractStringBuilder}} (not visible in javadocs) whose append methods return an {{AbstractStringBuilder}}.
 - The append methods of {{StringBuffer}} use java's _covariant return types_, and return {{StringBuffer}}. This generates the bridge methods in {{StringBuffer}}, so there are two append methods.
 - The scala-compiler does not expect bridge methods in -target:jvm-1.4 mode
