=== What is the expected behavior? ===
It should do something sensible.


=== What do you see instead? ===
xCharData, xComment: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
xCharRef:  Just loops.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24736-b20110412020139
This is a regression from 2.7.7, where the output was:
```scala
scala> x.xCharData
:1:1: '[' expected instead of '<'<foo/>^
java.lang.RuntimeException: FATAL
	at scala.Predef$$.error(Predef.scala:76)
	at scala.xml.parsing.MarkupParser$$class.xToken(MarkupParser.scala:267)
	at scala.xml.parsing.ConstructingParser.xToken(ConstructingParser.scala:56)
	at scala.xml.parsing.MarkupParser$$class.xToken(MarkupParser.scala:274)
	at scala.xml.parsing.ConstructingParser.xToken(ConstructingParser.scala:56)
```

The cause was the refactoring of !MarkupParser* in r20212, which dropped the error("FATAL") from the library version of xToken.  Attached is a patch with a sample fix.
Duplicate of #4339.
