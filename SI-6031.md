allow the cnf budget to be customized
catch stack overflows in CNF conversion and treat them like a cnf budget exceeded error
fwiw, I did exceed the default analysis budget in some “real world” code. (Well, I work for a university, so maybe I don't get to claim that, but it's production code I got paid to write.)

with potentially incriminating identifiers shortened:

```
abstract sealed trait T
case object T1 extends T
case object T2 extends T
case object T3 extends T
case object T4 extends T
case object T5 extends T
case object T6 extends T
case object T7 extends T
case object T8 extends T
case object T9 extends T
case object T10 extends T
case object T11 extends T
case object T12 extends T
case object T13 extends T
case object T14 extends T
case object T15 extends T
case object T16 extends T

case class C(t: T)

object S {
  def foo(xs: Seq[C]) =
    xs match {
      case Seq(C(T1), C(T2)) => true
      case _ => false
    }
}
```

increasing the budget to 512 made the warning go away.
