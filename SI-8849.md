ExecutionContext.Implicits.global seems to get used as an implicit when you (or I at least) least expect it.

I expected the following code to use my fixed thread pool, and was quite surprised when it didn't.

{code:scala}
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContext, Future}
import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

object Foo {
  def main(args: Array[String]) { 
    val pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)
    implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(pool)
    (1 to 10).foreach { i =>
      Future {
        Thread.sleep(1000)
      }
    }
    pool.shutdown()
  }
}
{code}

The issue seems to be that {{global}} has a more specific type than {{ExecutionContext}} and thus gets selected (if it's imported anywhere in scope) over any implicit {{ExecutionContext}} in scope, regardless of other forms of priority. This seems scary to me. I don't think it's necessarily a _bug_, but it seems to be asking for trouble.

I've wondered why global isn't an ExecutionContextExecutorService.

Maybe lint or -Xlog-implicits could step in.  Also for name binding gotchas:

https://gist.github.com/paulp/36b67d27400a9f3be96a

And while it's feeling helpful, maybe it could also warn about the collisions in {code}import collection._, concurrent._, util._{code} especially since concurrent.util doesn't show up in the scaladoc.  Or -Yno-import-util.

Nasty gotcha.

Here's the general implicit search behaviour in question:

{code}
class A
class B extends A

object O {
  implicit val b: B = new B

  {
    implicit val a: A = new B

    implicitly[A]/*(b)*/ 
  }
}
{code}

Yeah, while I'm also not a fan of the implicit search behavior, I think it's operating according to spec. This is more of a library-level gotcha where I think the {{ExecutionContextExecutor}} shenanigans could be rethought, or at least made less error-prone. 
But it's just static overloading behavior. Everybody loves static overloading behavior.

If the global is loosened to {{ExecutionContext}}, perhaps it could be renamed to {{`I am a reasonable default thread pool`}} or, after the next {{tlc}} merge, {{implicit lazy val _: ExecutionContext = ???}}.

I could go for a shorter name like {{LowBallImps}} if necessary, but to support quick demos:
{code}
scala> trait LowPriorityImplicits { implicit def `I am a reasonable thread pool`: ExecutionContext = concurrent.ExecutionContext.global }
defined trait LowPriorityImplicits

scala> object Test extends App with LowPriorityImplicits {
     |   implicit val x: ExecutionContext = ExecutionContext fromExecutor new java.util.concurrent.Executor {
     |     override def execute(r: Runnable) { Console println s"I don't like it, but I'll do it: $r"; r.run }
     |   }
     |   Await ready (Future(Console println 42), Inf)
     | }
defined object Test

scala> Test main null
I don't like it, but I'll do it: scala.concurrent.impl.Future$PromiseCompletingRunnable@3e34ace1
42

scala> object Test extends App with LowPriorityImplicits {
     | Await ready (Future(Console println 42), Inf)
     | }
defined object Test

scala> Test main null
42

{code}
[~viktor.klang] Do you perchance remember why this implicit had a more specific type than `ExecutionContext`?
I would put question this way:

{code}

package concurrency.antipatterns


import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import scala.concurrent.{ExecutionContextExecutor, ExecutionContext, Future}


import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global  // ! my IDE marks  it as not used, but I should not believe in it

object ExecutionContextTrap {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    val pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)

    implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(pool)


    println("global:" + ExecutionContext.Implicits.global)    // ExecutionContextImpl
    println("ec: " + ec)                                      // ExecutionContextImpl

    println("--------------")

    // NOTE that in implicit scope we have this:
    // implicit val global : scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor          -> ExecutionContextImpl (1)
    // implicit val ec: ExecutionContext = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(pool)  -> ExecutionContextImpl (2)

    Future {
        println(Thread.currentThread.getName)
        Thread.sleep(1000)
    } // expects instance of ExecutionContext  // ExecutionContextImpl from 'ec' !

    val who = implicitly[ExecutionContext]    // ExecutionContextImpl from 'global' !
    println("who:" + who)

    //  Like

    // 1. Future to Implicit scope:
    // Give me a value by type ExecutionContext as key

    // 2. Implicit scope:
    // Ok, how many implementations of type ExecutionContext in the key row?
      // "ExecutionContextExecutor" itself and "ExecutionContextExecutor"
    // who of them is less abstract? Who is a child?
      // ExecutionContextExecutor! because ExecutionContextExecutor extends ExecutionContextExecutor
    // then ExecutionContextExecutor is a key - and it refers to - > ExecutionContextImpl
    // here we go - you get a ExecutionContextImpl (1)

    pool.shutdown()

    Thread.sleep(1000)
  }
}

// Q: Why Future {}() does not follow 'implicitly'-logic?
{code}

Q: Why Future {}() does not follow 'implicitly'-logic?

So I could NOT reproduce the issue, Future does use ec, and that is the question, because implictly[ExecutionContext] uses global ex contex, becasue it indeed is more specific/concrete (less abstract - child one)


Also look at this: https://github.com/Sergey80/scala-samples/blob/master/src/main/scala/implicits/ImplicitlyLookupSample.scala

if that makes sense
