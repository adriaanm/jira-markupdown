Fedora 8 does not install ant-contrib on the path that build.xml expects.
So to get the compilation process going I had to create symlinks to a lot of jars from under /usr/share/ant/lib to /usr/share/java/ant/*.jar and /usr/share/java/ant-*.jar.  I used a simple shell shell script called /usr/share/ant/lib/RK-create-ant-links.sh with the following contents:

```scala
#!/usr/bin/env bash

## save this file as /usr/share/ant/lib/RK-create-ant-links.sh and run as root.

pushd /usr/share/ant/lib
# create symlinks to ant libraries from /usr/share/java/ant ...
for i in ../../java/ant/*.jar ; do
    ln -sf "$$i"   "$$(basename $$i)"
done

# create symlinks to java libraries from /usr/share/java ...
for i in ../../java/ant*.jar  ; do
    ln -sf "$$i" "$$(basename $$i)"
done

popd
```

I also had to get binaries like antRun to be accessible to the build by using another shell script /usr/share/ant/RK-init-bin.sh with the following content:

```scala
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# save this file as /usr/share/ant/RK-init-bin.sh and run as root...

pushd /usr/share/ant
mkdir -p bin

pushd bin
ln -sf ../../../bin/antRun antRun
popd

popd
```

Execute the 2 scripts using bash and the build command worked fine:

```scala
~/download/scala/scala-2.6.1-RC2/
ANT_OPTS="-Xmx800M" ant build
ANT_OPTS="-Xmx800M" ant test
```

Note that I am using the IcedTea-1.7 version of JVM that comes with Fedora8:

```scala
  # java -version
java version "1.7.0"
IcedTea Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0-b21)
IcedTea 64-Bit Server VM (build 1.7.0-b21, mixed mode)
```

After the build, "ant pack" for being unable to allocate memory:

```scala
  # ANT_OPTS="-Xmx800M" ant pack
... 
msil.sources:

msil.libraries:
    [quick] Compiling 95 source files to /root/download/scala/scala-2.6.1-RC2/build/msil/src

BUILD FAILED

```

The above seems to be due to missing ilasm command on my mono setup (default Fedora package setups):


```scala
  # rpm -qa | gi mono
monodoc-1.2.3-1.fc7
mono-data-sybase-1.2.5.1-3.fc8
mono-nunit-1.2.5.1-3.fc8

mono-core-1.2.5.1-3.fc8
monodevelop-0.13.1-1.fc7
mono-data-postgresql-1.2.5.1-3.fc8
```


During the ant pack process I also got tons of tar warnings:
```scala

```

But for some reason the mono platform on Fedora8 (plus livna RPM repository) does not seem to have the ilasm command (I don't know why).  Even then, "ant msil.libraries" succeeded:

I would also appreciate an "rpm" task in the build.xml that would allow me to easily build an rpm package (Where is the .spec file used to build the 2.6.0 scala rpm distribution?).

Here are a few remarks:

1) The library `ant-contrib.jar` is part of the Scala source archive and is located in directory `$$INSTALL_DIR/lib`, so `build.xml` does know its location

2) Concerning Ant itself, be sure the Ant commands are defined in the `$$PATH` variable (no user-defined shell script needed!)

3) Concerning IcedTea 1.7, we didn't try it so far, but it is based on OpenJDK 1.7 and should thus work fine too (we use Sun Java 1.7)

4) The tar Ant task produces a GNU tar; the warning messages are displayed for old tar tools that do not support long file names (see http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTasks/tar.html)

5) `ilasm` is a development tool and is part of the `mono-devel` package (see http://hany.sk/~hany/RPM/f-updates-8-i386/mono-devel-1.2.5.1-3.fc8.i386.html)
