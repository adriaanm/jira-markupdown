The problem is best illustrated in the REPL:
```scala
scala> List(1, 2, 3).toSet.subsets(2).map(_.toList)
res0: Iterator[List[Int]] = non-empty iterator

scala> List(1, 2, 3).toSet.subsets.map(_.toList)
<console>:8: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => x$1.toList)
              List(1, 2, 3).toSet.subsets.map(_.toList)
```

Note that doing this with Set(1, 2, 3) directly does not produce the issue.

Both Set.subsets and Set.subsets(Int) have the same return type so I don't see why the latter line should not compile.

Originally, I asked this as a [question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27357353/scala-missing-parameter-type)
