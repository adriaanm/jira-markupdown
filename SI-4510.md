=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
scala> val a1 = new Array[Unit](3)
a1: Array[Unit] = Array(null, null, null)

scala> val a2 = Array((),(),())
a2: Array[Unit] = Array((), (), ())

scala> a1(0)

scala> a1(0)= null

scala> a1
res17: Array[Unit] = Array((), null, null)

scala> a2
res18: Array[Unit] = Array((), (), ())

scala> a2(0)

scala> a2(0) = null

scala> a2
res21: Array[Unit] = Array((), (), ())

scala> val au: Unit = null
au: Unit = ()
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
It should be consistent. If 



=== What do you see instead? ===
The whole behavior is inconsistent. Sometimes an {{Array[Unit]}} is printed as filled with {{null}}s, sometimes filled with {{()}}, if you assign {{null}} to a value of type Unit it gets converted to {{()}} (Is that even mentioned in the spec?�), etc. ...

� Just searched in the spec a bit. I wonder if even the assignment of null is legal, because `Unit` is mentioned in the "value class" section in 12.2.3.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24736-b20110412020139
(In r24895) Special case Array[Unit] printing in the repl to make soc happy.
There are still nulls in there, but now we can blissfully pretend
they don't exist, until we crash.  Closes #4510, no review.
