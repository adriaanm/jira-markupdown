Thanks for the clear bug report.

Working on a fix: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/7234

Still a few subtle interactions to deal with.

Here's a related crasher:
```scala
trait Main {
  trait A {
    type B
  }
  trait C {
    def c(a: A, x: Int = 0)(bs: a.B*)
    def d(a: A, x: Int = 0)(b: a.B)
  }
  def c: C
  def fail3(a: A)(b: a.B) = c.c(a)(Seq[A#B](b): _*) // should fail, crashes with .setInfo(null)
}
```
