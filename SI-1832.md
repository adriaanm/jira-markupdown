After trying to compile the code below the compiler crashed with the exception in GenICode$$ICodePhase.genLoadArguments. Tried both on 2.7.3final and 2.8.0.r17382 - same results. See the call stack below.
```scala
// Edit by paulp: reduced.
trait Cloning {
  trait Foo
  def fn(g: Any => Unit): Foo
  
  implicit def mkStar(i: Int) = new { def *(a: Foo): Foo = null }

  val pool = 4 * fn { case iii: Int => iii * 2 }
}
```
```scala
# scalac Swarm.scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: symbol value iii$$1 does not exist in playground.Swarm.main
	at scala.tools.nsc.backend.icode.GenICode$$ICodePhase.scala$$tools$$nsc$$backend$$icode$$GenICode$$ICodePhase$$$$genLoad(GenICode.scala:912)
	at scala.tools.nsc.backend.icode.GenICode$$ICodePhase.genLoadArguments(GenICode.scala:1103)
```
I think this is related to #1110, a bug which looked easy to fix but when I tried a while back I did not succeed.  Notice that if you use a name like "foo" instead of "*" it compiles okay.
Also if i move the actor { ... } call to a separate val proto definition and than just do 4 * proto it also works :-|

```scala
  val proto = actor {   ...   }
  val pool = 4 * proto
```

Might me a useful hint.
I think it was assigned to you because I speculated above that it is related to #1110, and that because this bug also is triggered only when one uses a method name which is shared by the name of a primitive operation.

On closer inspection I don't think they're related except inasmuch as the platonically ideal fix to both bugs would likely involve some shared machinery for dealing with the issue.
