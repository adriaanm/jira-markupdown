OK, let's see here:

The return type of Object in RunWrapper is correct.  This is how generics work.

Unless we special case main, you will have to write a method which is specifically Unit, you can't use a generic implementation because the jvm requires the exact signature.

When I first saw the example I thought there was a bug, but now if there is one I don't know what it is, other than that we should spot a method which looks like it's trying to be an entry point and warn that it is not in fact an entry point.
