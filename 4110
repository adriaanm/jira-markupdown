Your errors are probably just ant not having enough memory.

It's easy for the tests to pass and all the warnings to be valid, because scalac ignores the generic signatures completely.  To see the breakage caused by this bug, you generally have to involve java so that something will be miscompiled based on the inaccurate signature.

Signature verification wasn't on by default for performance reasons, so you will probably want to measure the asm impact.

The underlying issue is fairly hairy (and there is more than one.) I have it fairly well outlined and fixed for some approximation of fixed, but I have recently lost my taste for this brand of completely thankless work.  If you want I can clean up that branch and hand it over if you'd like to go for the finish line.
