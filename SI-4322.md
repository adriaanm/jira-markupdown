from/until/to in SortedMap do a linear search rather than O(log n). 

=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable._
import scala.math._
val map = SortedMap.empty[Double]++{ for(i <- 0 until 1000000) yield random }
map from 0.5 //This takes a long time
{code}

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Very fast behavior. By using the hack in the below link, performance is as expected.

=== What do you see instead? ===
Very slow behavior.

=== Additional information ===

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:2.8.1
  - Java:1.6
  - Operating system: OS X
Sorry, I typed the wrong type in. Should be a SortedSet in the example. The behavior is the same on maps and sets.

{code}
import scala.collection.immutable._
import scala.math._
val set = SortedSet.empty[Double]++{ for(i <- 0 until 1000000) yield random }
set from 0.5 //This takes a long time
{code}

Not only it is O(n), but it is buggy as well! However, this should not hold true for Scala trunk, as it should have been solved on https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/3796. At least it seems to work fine here.

Please test this sort of thing against trunk before opening a ticket.
