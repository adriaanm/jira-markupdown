The docs should be elaborated, including pointers to the relevant Java classes. Concretely, thereâ€™s nothing about scala.concurrent.forkjoin.ForkJoinPool --> we should point to the corresponding Java docs.

Example clarifications:

If you know for sure that you only have a single thread blocking on the Process, then you could do this to create your ExecutionContext:

{code}
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
val ec = ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor())
{code}
