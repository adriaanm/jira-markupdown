It's like a paean to inheritance. {{MappedBaseTypeSeq}} and {{SynchronizedBaseTypeSeq}} both extend {{BaseTypeSeq}}, both override lateMap, and neither override ever calls super.lateMap so there's no scenario where {{new MappedBaseTypeSeq(this, f) with SynchronizedBaseTypeSeq}} will do the right thing.

There are probably a thousand other bugs in this arrangement, the count only limited by which combinations happen to be exercised at the moment. I bet retronym's change has nothing to do with it per se - it didn't happen because nothing was nearly enough correct to ever reach that code block.
