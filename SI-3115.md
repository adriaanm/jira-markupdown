I was hoping to deprecate a package object ("what? already?") since the whole package has moved and that would be the cleanest way to deprecate the forwarding stubs, but:
{code}
[scalacfork] /scala/trunk/src/library/scala/util/parsing/syntax/package.scala:14: error: expected start of definition
[scalacfork] package object syntax {
[scalacfork] ^
[scalacfork] one error found
{code}
As I began this ticket I thought that deprecating an object tagged everything inside it as deprecated, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  It is what I had intended for scala.Math, but now I find that referencing it directly gets the warning, but its contents skate by:
{code}
scala> scala.Math   
<console>:5: warning: object Math in package scala is deprecated: use scala.math package instead

scala> scala.Math.Pi
res0: Double = 3.141592653589793
{code}
Hopefully there is some remedy possible short of directly annotating all several dozen of scala.Math's members.  Actually even that isn't much of a remedy because that code is all shared with the undeprecated scala.math package.

(I know nobody would DREAM of suggesting cutting and pasting, so let's not even go there.)
(In r21100) Closes SI-3115. Reviw by rytz
I am reopening this issue as package objects still can not be deprecated and from the the comments and commits I can not see the clear resolution for that matter. 

I would like to deprecate the whole package and I can not do it in any way except by going to all public classes and objects and annotating them with @deprecated. In my case the package has quite a few classes and annotating them is not negligible work.


Confirming that package level deprecation remains unimplemented.
