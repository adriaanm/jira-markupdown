scala> def foo(xs:List[String]) = xs match { case Seq(x) => x ; case Seq(x,y) => "" }
<console>:4: error: unreachable code
       def foo(xs:List[String]) = xs match { case Seq(x) => x ; case Seq(x,y) => "" }
{code}

works in 2.7.5.

also maybe the use of Seq should be giving a deprecation warning?

if I replace Seq with Sequence, then I first get:
{code}
error: not found: value Sequence
{code}

I think this must be an oversight where something is missing from Predef. if I import
Sequence then I find Sequence has the same bug:
{code}
scala> import scala.collection.Sequence
import scala.collection.Sequence

scala> def foo(xs:List[String]) = xs match { case Sequence(x) => x ; case Sequence(x,y) => "" }
<console>:5: error: unreachable code
       def foo(xs:List[String]) = xs match { case Sequence(x) => x ; case Sequence(x,y) => "" }
{code}

It happens again with r19108
{code}
class Test {
  def test[A](list: List[A]) = list match {
    case Seq(x, y) => "xy"
    case Seq(x) => "x"
    case _ => "something else"
  }
}
{code}
gives
{code}
Test.scala:4: error: unreachable code
    case Seq(x) => "x"
                   ^
one error found
{code}
but
{code}
class Test {
  def test[A](list: List[A]) = list match {
    case Seq(x) => "x"
    case Seq(x, y) => "xy"
    case _ => "something else"
  }
}
{code}
compiles without complaints.
(In r21923) Overhauled sequence length logic in the pattern matcher.  Removes
unnecessary boxing and a few varieties of wrongness.

Closes SI-3395, SI-3150, SI-2958, SI-2945, SI-2187.  No review.
