Snipped the original report, replacing with the essential issue:
{code}
val p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("ls");
type Destroyable = { def destroy() : Unit }
def doDestroy( obj : Destroyable ) : Unit = obj.destroy(); 
doDestroy( p );
{code}
This results in:
{code}
java.lang.IllegalAccessException: Class  can not access a member of class java.lang.UNIXProcess with modifiers "public synchronized"
	at sun.reflect.Reflection.ensureMemberAccess(Reflection.java:65)
{code}
Hi.

I don't think that the "synchronized" keyword has anything to do with this. I think that the issue is that the implementation of duck typing tries to reflectively invoke methods on the concrete class' method, even if the concrete class is nonpublic but implements a public interface. Perhaps the compiler should check the accessibility of the class, and then climb up parents to see if an accessible base class or interface implements the required methods before accepting an object as conformant, and it should use the appropriate public base class's reflective method rather than that of the nonpublic concrete method.

Here's a very self-contained example, typed quickly into REPL. Here a Process object is the base class with a nonpublic implementation -- java.lang.UNIXProcess (I haven't tried this example on a non-UNIX-y platform.)

I hope this is helpful! Thanks for a fascinating language.

Sorry about the bad formatting in the previous note. I'll attach a separate text file.

I'll also attach a file that includes an implementation of climbing an inheritance hierarchy for an accessible member. No warranties -- it's been years since I wrote or looked at this code, but I think it's OK. For whatever it's worth. Feel free to use/modify/whatever this class, no strings attached. (I'm its author.) The method of interest is findInPublicScope(Method m).

Thanks again for Scala.

This is the bug causing it:
[http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4071957]

Since Sun does not appear to ever fix this, a suggested workaround was to do:
{code}
method.setAccessible(true)
{code}
This obviously only works when the SecurityManager allows it, but that would be no worse than current behavior.
(In r22476) Closes SI-2318 (spurious IllegalAccessException thrown by some structural calls, caused by Java bug 4071957). Review by malayeri.
The new fix breaks ALL the structural types when using SecurityManager. Perhaps a quick check for
"System.getSecurityManager == null" should be added to allow at least SOME Structural types in applets?

{code}
object Main {
  trait Bar { def bar: Unit }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Sandbox: " + (System.getSecurityManager != null))
    System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager)
    println("Sandbox: " + (System.getSecurityManager != null))

    val b = new Bar { def bar = println("bar") }
    b.bar

    val structural = b.asInstanceOf[{ def bar: Unit }]
    structural.bar
  }
}
{code}
