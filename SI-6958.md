PR https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1849 should be backported to 2.10.1.
For the future work stealer, this backport was delayed because the commit on 2.11 relied on a paulp refactor.  It's as if, in the generation after Noah, one was given the opportunity to travel back through time and fix an apparatus that was constructed before the Earth was cleansed.  Let's say the apparatus was the Tower of Babel (and I don't recall off-hand if that was actually before or after the flood; probably after, since after the flood, everyone spoke whatever Noah spoke, including his charming Noahisms). "Hey, if we could fix that tower, with its spiral staircase to heaven, we'd all be programming in Scala today."
