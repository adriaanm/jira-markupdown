Example:
```scala
class A {
  def foo(x: Int) = 0
  def foo(x: String) = 1
}

class ann(x: Int) extends StaticAnnotation

class t {
  val a = new A
  @ann(a.foo(1)) def bar = 1
}
```

When pickling the annotation tree, the symbol "foo" gets written as EXTref, i.e. only owner and name are saved. The UnPickler reads the owner and searches the symbol using `owner.info.decl(name)`, which in the case of "foo" yields an OverloadedSymbol.

Pickling also the type of "foo" and use that to select the correct alternative does not work: pickling the the `MethodType(x: Int): Int` writes a reference to "symbol foo" again (because that's the owner of "x"), which produces an infinite loop at UnPickling (UnPickle "symbol foo" => UnPickle the MethodType => UnPickle "symbol foo" => ...).

Pickling "symbol foo" as if it were local (isLocal) is wrong this creates another Symbol instance for the method foo, symbols should be unique.
