A minor cosmetic issue.
Both the compiler and the interpreter will get confused if Int (or Long, or Boolean, etc) are used as values. For instance, the following compiles successfully:
```scala
object X extends Application { Int }
```
but crashes at runtime:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/Int$$
	at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredMethods0(Native Method)
	at java.lang.Class.privateGetDeclaredMethods(Class.java:2395)
	at java.lang.Class.getMethod0(Class.java:2642)
	at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:1579)
	at scala.tools.nsc.ObjectRunner$$.run(ObjectRunner.scala:70)
	at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner$$.main(MainGenericRunner.scala:164)
	at scala.tools.nsc.MainGenericRunner.main(MainGenericRunner.scala)
```

Similarly, the interpreter will not print a regular error message, but will print instead:

```scala
scala> Int
<console>:4: error: value asInstanceOf is not a member of object Int
("" + "res0: Int.type = " +  (if(`res0`.asInstanceOf[AnyRef] != null)  { val tmp = `res0`.toString();  (if(tmp.contains('\n')) "\n" else "") + tmp + "\n"} else "null\n")
```

This issue is clearly low-priority, but still something that would be nice to fix at some point.
Well, the compiler **does** think Int, etc. have a companion object doesn't it?

```scala
scala> Int.MaxValue
res0: Int = 2147483647
```

It's just that the object doesn't really exist. For some reason the methods are added there via compiler trickery.

Okay, I couldn't come up with an example at the time that illustrated the existence of a companion object and the ScalaDoc doesn't list an Int object (probably another bug).

So the compiler probably just needs do some additional trickery it would seem.  
The changes I made for #1107 in r17228 also made this patch work, so recommitted in r17229.
