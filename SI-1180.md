I've removed the dependency on java.lang from IntMap and LongMap. The new collections should all be pure Scala now with no dependencies outside the Scala standard library, so hopefully should work on .NET. 
Thanks, I've updated trunk in r15713 with these versions.  It might make sense to move `highestOneBit` into something like RichInt and RichLong, but that would probably be best done as another ticket, since it will probably be a bit more controversial.
