As per [this Stackoverflow question|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42423441/compile-error-with-implicit-class-method-named-clone], following fails to compile:

{code:scala}
class Foo(val bar: String)

object Foo {
  implicit class Enrich(foo: Foo) {
    def clone(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
  }
}

object Main extends App {
  val foo = new Foo("hello")
  println(foo.clone(1, 2))    // <- does not compile
}
{code}


{code:scala}

Perhaps indirectly related to [SI-6760|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6760] but overloaded method had different signature than `Object.clone`.

This does compile under 2.10.6. Biggest difference I see in the type tree is that 2.10.6 tried to cook the method parameters while 2.11.8 doesn't:

2.11.8:

{code:scala}
DefDef( // def clone(x: Int,y: Int): Int in class Enrich
 <method>
 "clone"
{code}

2.10.6:

{code:scala}
DefDef( // def clone(x: Int,y: Int): Int in class Enrich
 <method> <triedcooking>
  "clone"
{code}
Hah, nice one. This is because implicit conversions that target a superclass of AnyRef are ruled out:

{code}
        pt match {
          case Function1(_, out) =>
            // must inline to avoid capturing result
            def prohibit(sym: Symbol) = (sym.tpe <:< out) && { // BUG: when looking for implicit conversion to `?{def clone: ?}`, this triggers because AnyRef has that method
              maybeInvalidConversionError(s"the result type of an implicit conversion must be more specific than ${sym.name}")
              true
            }
            if (prohibit(AnyRefClass) || (settings.isScala211 && prohibit(AnyValClass)))
              result = SearchFailure
          case _                 => false
        }
{code}
Consider this REPL transcript:

{code:scala}
scala> class Foo { def apply(a: Int, b: Int) = (a,b) }
defined class Foo

scala> implicit class IntFoo(i: Int) { def foo = new Foo }
defined class IntFoo

scala> 1.foo(2,3)
res1: (Int, Int) = (2,3)
{code}

So when you call {{foo.clone(1, 2)}} an implicit conversion to structural type
{noformat}
?{ def clone: ? }
{noformat}
 has to be considered. And that is a supertype of {{AnyRef}}.
To be clear, I don't know the internals of the compiler. But it is my understanding that when I call {{1.foo}} and the compiler sees that {{Int}} doesn't have a {{foo}} method, it will look for an implicit value that conforms to 
{code:scala}
Int => ?{def foo: ?}
{code}
because it doesn't know anything about the required result type other than that it should have a method called {{foo}}.
And in the {{clone}} case, {{AnyRef}} had a method {{def clone(): AnyRef}} and also a bunch of other methods, so that makes {{AnyRef}} a subtype of the structural type that contains only a method {{def clone: ?}}.

Now aside of that, I think the compiler uses some extra internal mechanisms other than pure basic userfacing implicit search, because

{code:scala}
scala> implicitly[AnyRef <:< Any{def clone: Any}]
<console>:8: error: Cannot prove that AnyRef <:< Any{def clone: Any}.
              implicitly[AnyRef <:< Any{def clone: Any}]
                        ^

scala> implicitly[AnyRef <:< Any{def clone(): Any}]
res1: <:<[AnyRef,Any{def clone(): Any}] = <function1>
{code}




@Jasper Thanks for that explanation, that makes sense.

Just to clear my mind, when we say "structural type", we're talking about some structure of a type and not explicitly about the Scala feature called structural types, right? We just need a way to describe a *shape* of a type we don't know yet.

Regarding your example in the code, what is that trying to convey? Not sure I follow. I would imagine the first one doesn't work is it doesn't match the structure of `Object.clone`.
