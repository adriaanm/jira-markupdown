Of course, -Xlint will warn you about the uselessly inferred type, even if it's useful.

You don't want to -Xlint:-warn-any,_ whenever you interpolate.
```scala
scala> f"${3.14}%f is ${"pi"}%s"
<console>:8: warning: a type was inferred to be `Any`; this may indicate a programming error.
              f"${3.14}%f is ${"pi"}%s"
                  ^
res0: String = 3.140000 is pi

scala> import reflect.runtime._
import reflect.runtime._

scala> import universe._
import universe._

scala> q"val i = 4"
res1: reflect.runtime.universe.ValDef = val i = 4

scala> val j = 5
j: Int = 5

scala> q"{ $res1 ; $j }"
<console>:16: warning: a type was inferred to be `Any`; this may indicate a programming error.
              q"{ $res1 ; $j }"
                   ^
res2: reflect.runtime.universe.Tree =
{
  val i = 4;
  5
}
```
