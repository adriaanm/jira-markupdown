Basically, it's inconsistent with case class inheritance. Suppose I have
```scala
  case class Foo(foo : String, bar : Int);
  case class Baz(baz : Int, bloop : String) extends Foo(bloop, baz);
```

This would have to extend both Product2[String, Int] and Product2[Int, String], which isn't allowed.
