Basically, it's inconsistent with case class inheritance. Suppose I have

{code}
  case class Foo(foo : String, bar : Int);
  case class Baz(baz : Int, bloop : String) extends Foo(bloop, baz);
{code}

This would have to extend both Product2[String, Int] and Product2[Int, String], which isn't allowed.
