ClassTag gets this right:

{code}
scala> reflect.classTag[Array[Unit]].erasure
warning: there were 1 deprecation warning(s); re-run with -deprecation for details
res59: Class[_] = class [Lscala.runtime.BoxedUnit;
{code}

ClassTag is already safe to use, unlike TypeTag which invokes the not-yet-thread-safe runtime reflection library.

Marking as wont-fix, as we don't plan to touch manifests any more.
