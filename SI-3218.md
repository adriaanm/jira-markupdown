There seems to be an error with partially applied functions and implicit type conversion. Here's a simple example:


{code}
import java.util.{List => JList}
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
import scala.collection.JavaConversions._

object PartialTest {

def fromJava[T](li: JList[T]): List[T] = asList(li).toList

//implicit conversion - ok
def test1(jList:JList[_]) = jList.filter(_.isInstanceOf[java.lang.Object])

//explicit conversion - ok
def test2(jList:JList[_]) {
val f = fromJava(jList).filter _
f(_.isInstanceOf[java.lang.Object])
}

//implicit conversion - error
def test3(jList:JList[_]) {
val f = jList.filter _
f(_.isInstanceOf[java.lang.Object])
}

}

{code}

The first 2 methods works fine (test1 + test2), but the last one (test3) gives an error which looks a little bit funny:

{code}
error: missing arguments for method filter in trait TraversableLike;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
       val f = jList.filter _
                     ^
{code}

That's what I've alreasy done ;) So for me it looks like an error with implicit conversions in combination with a partially applied function.

Scala 2.8.0-20100318.025813-346

Here are two ways you could write that line which do work.  Either of these is more natural to the parser than the one you're reporting.
{code}
  // way 1
  val f = jList filter _
  // way 2
  val f = jList.filter(_)
{code}
That's right. But in the 'Programming in Scala' book section 8.6 there is a - at least in my opinion - similar example: 

{code}
def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) = a + b + c
val a = sum _
a(1, 2, 3)
{code}

So I thought that my example should work too ??
But regardless of this I've noticed that always a !ClassCastException is thrown:

{code}
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer cannot be cast to scala.collection.immutable.List	
{code}
I can get around it by calling toList but if the filter-method is not allowed on the converted jList object I would except an compiler error or do I misunderstand something ?
