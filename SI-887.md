AFAIU, List.++ always reconstructs list from scratch, even if second operand is already list. So, List.++ should be:

```scala
def ++[B >: A](that: Iterable[B]) = that match {
  case list: List[B] => this ::: list
  case _ =>
    val buf = new ListBuffer[B]
    this copyToBuffer buf
    that copyToBuffer buf
    buf.toList
}

// special case to avoid instanceOf if that is known to be List
def ++[B >: A](that: List[B]) = that ::: this
```

or even better

```scala
def ++[B >: A](that: Iterable[B]) = this ::: that.toList
```
