I have tried to figure out sequence of interactions with compiler that leads to exception. But no luck so far :(
All sources compiles normally, without errors. After some time (it may be 5 or 100 completion calls) compiler throws exception. Exception always contains some {{object}} with case classes in it.
Can we  try to find out in which cases compiler may not behave as expected by looking at sources?
