I seem to be able to create some kind of "deadlock" by running a test (declared in {{Main.scala}}). The deadlock is caused by separate threads which are accessing {{a.b.c.Oxbow$class.$init$}} - the first because of a call to a method brought into scope via an {{import a.b.c.Oxbow._}} and the second by {{import a.b.c._}}. If you run the test a few times, eventually you'll see the "deadlock" - I'm left with two threads which are doing this:

I'm calling it a "deadlock" (i.e. in moderately ironic quotation marks) because, according to JConsole, there is no deadlock and according to the stacks both threads are in {{RUNNABLE}} state and are not {{WAITING}} at all (could they have been woken up by a call to notify?) - but they don't appear to be doing anything. You can leave it for 10 minutes and the threads will be in the same state

If I change the code so that both {{Test1}} and {{Test2}} do {{import a.b.c._}} then the issue is not observed


The files are organized as follows:

{noformat}
in package a.b.c

  File Oxbow.scala
  File package.scala

In package a.b.c.d

  File Bippy.scala

in package test

  File Main.scala
{noformat}

You need to run {{Main.scala}} a few times to reveal the deadlock. I'm fairly confident that this must be a bug in scalac, rather than a trait initialization order problem on my side (although I could be wrong)
I just took a look at this test case. It looks like a deadlock, where the locks in play are the intrinsic locks on the corresponding Class objects that occur during class initialization [1].

A Scala module `Foo` has a corresponding module class `Foo$`, which contains a static field `MODULE$`, which is initialized to `new Foo$` in the static initializer of the class.

{noformat}
% cat sandbox/test.scala
object O {
  println(Thread.currentThread.getStackTrace.toList.take(5).mkString("\n"))
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    O
  }
}
% qbin/scalac sandbox/test.scala && qbin/scala Test
java.lang.Thread.getStackTrace(Thread.java:1503)
O$.<init>(test.scala:2)
O$.<clinit>(test.scala)
Test$.main(test.scala:7)
Test.main(test.scala) 
{noformat}

Generates:
{noformat}
scala> :javap -v -p O$
Compiled from "test.scala"
public final class O$ extends java.lang.Object
  SourceFile: "test.scala"
  Scala: length = 0x
...
{
public static final O$ MODULE$;

public static {};
  Code:
   Stack=1, Locals=0, Args_size=0
   0:	new	#2; //class O$
   3:	invokespecial	#12; //Method "<init>":()V
   6:	return

private O$();
  Code:
   Stack=3, Locals=1, Args_size=1
{noformat}

If objects form a cycle, those class initialization locks can deadlock:

{noformat}
object O1 {
  val x = O2.x
  def y = 0
}
object O2 {
  val x = O1.y
}

object Test extends App {
  Await.result(Future.sequence(List(future(O1.y), future(O2.x)), Duration.Inf)
}
{noformat}

Here's a stack overflow post about this topic [2].

Similar problems are possible with lazy vals; we have a bit more of an idea how to reduce those, which we've outlined in the Lazy Val SIP [3], which is planned for 2.12. But I don't know of any proposals to change the encoding of modules.

A workaround is to eagerly force objects during single threaded application startup to break the cycle. Or avoid cycles between objects.

I should mention that this is not specific to package objects; as far as the generated bytecode is concerned, they are no different from other Scala objects.

So I have to close this one as not-a-bug. I wish we could do more.

The potential deadlock in case of cyclic dependencies is speced:

{quote}
Note that the value deﬁned by an object deﬁnition is instantiated lazily. The
new m$cls constructor is evaluated not at the point of the object deﬁnition, but is
instead evaluated the ﬁrst time m is dereferenced during execution of the program
(which might be never at all). An attempt to dereference m again in the course
of evaluation of the constructor leads to a inﬁnite loop or run-time error. Other
threads trying to dereference m while the constructor is being evaluated block until
evaluation is complete.
{quote}

See Scala Specification (5.4).

One could wish we would just throw an exception at runtime in case of cyclic dependencies between objects or lazy vals. I believe we could do that but without invokedynamic cycle detection would be probably rather expensive.

See also SI-7814, in which the standard library exhibits a cyclic dependencies between objects.
I have a similar problem. One thing which exacerbates the issue for me is that the static initializer lock does not appear in any of the Java diagnostic tools.
These deadlocks appear to be invisible to all normal Java debugging tools.
The deadlocked threads are even marked "RUNNABLE" by the JVM.
