The following program compiles, 

{noformat}
import scala.concurrent._
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration.Inf

object Test {
  import ExecutionContext.Implicits._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("main()")
  }

  def delegate(): String = "abc"

  val r = Await.result(future {

    {
      "abc"
      // delegate()
    }

  }, Inf)
  println("awaited: " + r)
}
{noformat}


and when run prints:

{noformat}
awaited: abc
main()
{noformat}

However, uncommenting the invocation to {{delegate()}} results in the program not terminating.

I was expecting both versions to be semantically equivalent.
I don't know precisely what's happening here, other than it's a contravenes the safe construction guideline "Don't implicitly expose the "this" reference" [1]

[1] http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp0618/index.html

Here we can see the problem without {{scala.concurrent._}}:

{code}



object Test {
  import ExecutionContext.Implicits._

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("main()")
  }
  println("init Test")

  def delegate(): String = {println("delegate"); "abc"}

  val l = new java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch(1)
  new Thread {
    override def run() {
      delegate()
      l.countDown()
    }
  }.start()
  l.await()
}

So I'm tempted to close this as "not a bug". But perhaps we could include some static analysis to warn about this.

For example, FindBugs has a check [1]

{quote}
SC: Constructor invokes Thread.start() (SC_START_IN_CTOR)

The constructor starts a thread. This is likely to be wrong if the class is ever extended/subclassed, since the thread will be started before the subclass constructor is started.
{quote}

It's not quite the same thing, though: they are defending against subclassing, we are seeing something different here.

...

Okay, I think I see it now. It's the same deadlock pattern that led to the deprecation of {{scala.Application}}. [2] [3]
