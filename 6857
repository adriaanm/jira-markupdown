Interestingly, under -Yvirtpatmat it gives an unchecked warning (no warning with regular pattern matcher) but still infers Any => Any.
```scala
scala> def f(x: Any) = x match { case Foo(bar) => bar }
<console>:9: warning: non variable type-argument Any in type Foo[Any,Any] is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure
       def f(x: Any) = x match { case Foo(bar) => bar }
                                      ^
f: (x: Any)Any => Any
```
