The following compiles, although I think the conversion to type PartialFunction from this anonymous function expression is disallowed (there is no mention in SLS, Section 6.23, Anonymous Functions)

```scala
val g: PartialFunction[Int, Int] = (x => x match { case 2 => 3 })
```

Section 8.5, Pattern Matching Anonymous Functions, introduces the syntax `{case ...}` for defining a PartialFunction. If a Function type is expected, then the expression `{case ...}` is reinterpreted as `x => x match {case ...}`. The strange thing here is that the opposite conversion is happening: a Function expression `x => x match {case ...}` is given, and the compiler is interpreting it as a PartialFunction, `{case ...}`.

Here's another example:

```scala
Seq(1, "a").collect(x => x match { case s: String => s }) // evaluates to Seq(a)
```

If the Function expression gets a little more complicated, the conversion from Function to PartialFunction fails:

```scala
// this compiles
val g: PartialFunction[Int, Int] = (x: Int) => {x match { case 2 => 3 }}

// this fails; found Function[Int, Int], required PartialFunction[Int, Int]
val g: PartialFunction[Int, Int] = (x: Int) => {(); x match { case 2 => 3 }}
```

Apologies if I am misunderstanding the Spec.
Bumping the bug part.
```scala
SKALA 2.11.7-20150616-093756-43a56fb5a1> val g: PartialFunction[String, Int] = (x: Int) => x match { case "x" => 3 }
g: PartialFunction[String,Int] = <function1>
```
