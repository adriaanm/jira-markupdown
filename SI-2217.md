I asked this on a comment to ticket SI-1896, but at the time the request that fix r17719 be patched to the 2.7.x branch was denied.  At the time I was ok with this because, while definitely not ideal, I would just leave certain low-significant code untested and I would not have the compiler issue.

However, since that time we ran into actual production code, not just test/stub code, that exposes this compiler bug.  We tried all kinds of things to try and work around it but we could not.  The only way we had to work around it was to port the 1-line code fix of r17719 back to 2.7.5, call it 2.7.6, and publish that to our personal external maven repo for reuse.  This works for us, but I don't think it's going to work when we actually want to ship the code (our release organization doesn't like us shipping rogue code for good reason), and it certainly doesn't work for the rest of the Scala users in the world out there.

Sure we could "just upgrade" to 2.8 when it comes out, but not only must we ship before 2.8 is targeted to release (last I knew) and because of its binary incompatibility makes that a somewhat difficult thing to do even if this was an option.

So given that this issue fixes 3 separate ticket numbers: SI-715, SI-1896, and SI-1930, and that the code fix is simply removing this tiny bit of code "&& sym.owner.isPackageClass", I ask again that you please, please reconsider.
