There is a regression in the current nightly, the new ScriptEngine support implemented in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2238 doesn't work anymore:
{code}
scala> import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager

scala> val e = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName("scala")
e: javax.script.ScriptEngine = null
{code}
Earlier today, I happened to create a branch to add a test to make sure the nomaster 2.10 change to break this didn't leak into 2.11.  I'll also revert the forward merge.
{code}
apm@mara:~/projects/snytt$ git branch  | grep 223
  test/jsr223-service
{code}
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2945

The 2.10 PR https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2891 for reference. It looks like the merge commit is in M5?
