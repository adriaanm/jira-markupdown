Partest grep does not seem to be scanning recursively for patterns in files.
If there is a file in a test category which is in a separate subdirectory, grep will not catch it.

Below:

I tried to be thorough and yet courteous, to follow the exemplary excellence of the codebase by striving to improve in all things.  Mostly, I tried not to break anything by doing something stupid, so to that end it would be nice if there were tests for partest, perhaps in a future improvement.
