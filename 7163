my best guess is that the CBN transform messes up the symbol-owner structure of the block passed to nom as the first argument

it's weird that the second argument list is required to trigger this

simplified (attached):
```scala
object Test extends App {
  def nom (guard: => /*<-- must be CBN */Unit) (something: Unit) { }

  nom {
    val i = 0
    println(i) // i must be referenced
  }(/*must be omitted: ()*/)
}
```
