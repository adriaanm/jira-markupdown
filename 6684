This was an horrible decision whose time for fixing is long gone. It was long gone even when *I* first learned of it, years ago.

The best I can think of is make this behavior depend on a flag, defaulting to present behavior, and with a method returning a sensible behavior-flagged regex. Something like:

{code}
val Re = """(x)""".r.notAnchored
{code}

I suggest you implement it and submit through a pull request on github, then post the link to the pull request here. It is by far the way more likely to produce results.
