According to [SLS 6.15|http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-
expressions.html#conditional-expressions] :
```
The type of the conditional expression is the weak least upper bound of the types of e2 and e3.
```

However, it seems that the result of following code (conditional expression is included) is not correct:
```
scala> val x: Any = if(true) 1 else 1.0
x: Any = 1

scala> val x: Double = if(true) 1 else 1.0
x: Double = 1.0
```

because weak least upper bounds of Int (type of 1) and Double (type of 1.0) is Double, 1 should be converted 1.0 regardless of the expected type.
