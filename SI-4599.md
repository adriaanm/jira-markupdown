=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

The following code is used to read XMPP events from talk.google.com

```scala
import java.net.Socket
import java.io._

import scala.xml.pull._
import scala.io.Source

val HOST = "talk.google.com"
val PORT = 5222

var sock = new Socket(HOST, PORT)

val out = new PrintWriter(
    new BufferedOutputStream(sock.getOutputStream()), true)

val in =
    new XMLEventReader(Source.fromInputStream(
        new BufferedInputStream(sock.getInputStream()), "utf-8")).buffered

out.println("<?xml version='1.0'?>")
out.println("<stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams' to='chilon.net' version='1.0' xml:lang='en'>")

while (in.hasNext) System.out.println(in.next)

```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

I should receive all of the XML items from the input stream.


=== What do you see instead? ===

I miss the final </stream:features> tag. I verified with tcpdump that this is present. If I send further data (to trigger more data from the server) then eventually I will see the closing tag.. but then I will lack tags at the end again.

=== Additional information ===

Sometimes more than the last tag is missing. I've tried not using ".buffered" and without Buffered{Input,Output}Stream too. All the same results.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.0, 2.8.1, 2.9.0
  - Java: OpenJDK 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system: Linux 2.6.37
Here is more condensed test case:
```scala
val src = new io.Source {
  val iter = "<stream><features><foo/></features>".iterator ++
    Iterator.continually{ println("wait 5s"); Thread.sleep(5000); '\n' }.take(1) ++
    "</stream>".iterator
}
val reader = new xml.pull.XMLEventReader(src)
while (reader.hasNext) System.out.println(reader.next)
```

One would hope that `EvElemEnd(null,features)` is printed before waiting 5 second. Instead we get:
```scala
EvElemStart(null,stream,,)
EvElemStart(null,features,,)
EvElemStart(null,foo,,)
EvElemEnd(null,foo)
wait 5s
EvElemEnd(null,features)
EvText(
)
EvElemEnd(null,stream)
```

Not sure if it is something inherent to the XML parser.
With my XMPP server I am unable to do this:

- Send request to server
- Wait for response (final stream in node)
- Send repsonse based on entire final XML tag in response.

It will block forever before I can determine the final tag in the stream is closed... at best I can't make my second request knowing I've got the full information to respond to.
My current theory is that the following is happening. When reading the last closing tag sent, this method is called:

```scala
  def xEndTag(startName: String) {
    xToken('/')
    if (xName != startName)
      errorNoEnd(startName)

    xSpaceOpt
    xToken('>')
  }
```

Since that tag is properly sent, it runs up to `xToken('>')`, which is defined thus:

```scala
  def xToken(that: Char) {
    if (ch == that) nextch
    else xHandleError(that, "'%s' expected instead of '%s'".format(that, ch))
  }
```

Evidently, it calls `nextch`, which does the obvious thing:

```scala
  def nextch = {
    if (curInput.hasNext) {
      ch = curInput.next
      pos = curInput.pos
    } else {
```

The point here is that it needs to know if there is a next or not. Since this is a stream, it blocks until the stream is closed or something else is sent.

Unfortunately, the whole parser is based on having `ch` available (it is a `var`), so it doesn't look like there's an easy fix for it.

Having said that (which was actually a while ago, but it wasn't accepted because there was an answer already), I think it *can* be fixed. I'm presently compiling a patch that ought to do the trick.

My idea is moving nextch's logic into ch and creating a flag that ch checks to see if it executes nextch's logic or return the last read character. It also adds a var to keep that last read character.

Then, nextch is modified to call ch (in case it is called twice in a row), and then setting the flag to true. Finally, it is modified to return Unit instead of Char, and all (of two) places where its return value is used are changed to call ch afterwards.

Unfortunately, nextch and "var ch" are both public, so this means a change in their API, however unlikely it is for anyone to be using them directly.
I have now submitted a possible fix on[https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/18 github].

It does fix the issue reported, and it doesn't **seem** to break anything else. However, Scala's test are a bit low on XML tests.
But that's precisely what the patch does: stops `xEndTag` from freezing -- you are confusing the `xToken('>')` at `MarkupParser` with the one at the end of `xEndTag`.
Compiled scala with your patch applied (from the github scala clone master branch). Now attempting my test gives this:

It seems it's matching the end of the stream (but not eof) as '' or the empty string.

Alas of course it cannot find a closing tag to <stream:stream> as.. well it is a stream.
(extempore in [r24998](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=24998)) Fix #4599: XMLEventReader issue with input stream.

Makes MarkupParser.nextch lazy, only reaching out for the next char
when calling ch or eof. To make it possible, nextch now returns Unit
instead of Char. As it happens, that's how it is used almost everywhere.
