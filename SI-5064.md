Since yesterday (Oct. 6), I'm getting test failures in my scala-refactoring project with Scala 2.10-SNAPSHOT. I tracked them down to a wrong position; the following code:

bq. List(1)

is represented as

bq. immutable.this.List.apply[Int](1)

but the {{This}} tree has exactly the same RangePosition as the {{List}} {{Select}}, which is clearly incorrect.

Oh, yes, I didn't see that, sorry for the duplicate. It used to work because NoPosition trees are ignored, I can certainly handle it in my library if this is the expected behavior. But why isn't it an offset position? That's what I would have expected.

I'm not sure what to do, in my understanding of positions, both apply and unapply should be transparent positions and their underlying Ident or Select trees should have a range position. But if that prevents the IDE from hyperlinking directly to the definition of apply, then maybe we should just leave this as it is now.

Are you happy to close this ticket?
