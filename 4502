This Throwable is a CyclicInheritance in the source code which somehow escapes its catching logic. If you move line with `trait MyColl` above the definition of `trait MyLike` another error occurs:
```scala
error: object creation impossible, since method newBuilder in class GenericCompanion of type [A]scala.collection.mutable.Builder[A,MyColl[A]] is not defined
object MyColl extends SeqFactory[MyColl]
       ^
one error found
```
