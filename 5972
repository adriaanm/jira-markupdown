(extempore in [r25045|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25045]) Working on the finer points of the Total Repl Experience.  Some of
what is in this patch:

 - Instantaneous repl startup.  Closes #4561.
 - SIGINT handler installed last.  If you've been annoyed at the repl
being difficult to interrupt during its initialization, this one is
especially for you.
 - Started abstracting out some bits which would go into an API and
reconfiguring the repl in those terms.

For a good time, call S-C-A-L-A -Dscala.repl.power.  No review.
