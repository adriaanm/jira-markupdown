I don't know whether there are similar issue already or not. This kind of idea is hard to search.

We usually write a code that some parameter receives predefined constant:

button.textColor(Color.BLUE)

where Color is a class that have many predefined color constants. In the code above, "Color." seems redundant. Currently, import can be used to reduce this. 

import Color._
button.textColor(BLUE)

However, if we already have BLUE in this scope, existing BLUE is shadowed:

val BLUE = 32
import Color._
button.textColor(BLUE)
println(BLUE)	// this is not 32

I imagine an Scala language extension that the import clause would defined inside of parameter list:

def textColor((import Color._) color: Int)

Then we can write our code more concisely:

val BLUE = 32
button.textColor(BLUE)  // this is blue color
println(BLUE)  // this is 32
