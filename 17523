This is a regression since a few months ago. A presentation compiler that is asked to shutdown will cause any thread that calls `ask` to wait forever for a response. The sequence of calls is the following:
```scala
	def askItem(): Response[Unit] = {
		compiler.askForResponse { () =>
			Thread.sleep(100)
			println("inside Ask")
		}
	}

	def main(args: Array[String]) {
		val item1 = askItem()

		compiler.askShutdown()

		Thread.sleep(1000)
		val item2 = askItem()

                item2.get // will never return
       }
```

The second call to askitem places the work item on a queue that is not serviced anymore.
