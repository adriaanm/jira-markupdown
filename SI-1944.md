Hello,

I can no longer install the Eclipse plugin.

MacOS X 10.5.6, Java 5, Eclipse Ganymede 3.4.2

Eclipse reports:
  No repository found at http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin

and indeed if I surf to that address in Firefox I'll get redirected to 403
forbidden page
(http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/scala-plugin/)

Eclipse log tells me:
  !ENTRY org.eclipse.core.net 1 0 2009-05-01 12:14:22.136
  !MESSAGE System property http.proxyPort has been set to 8080 by an external
source. This value will be overwritten using the values from the preferences


Can you help me?


Best regards
  Axel

P.S.: The email given at http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94
to ask for assistance scala-tools@listes.epfl.ch bounces
The update site is fully functional from where I'm sitting, so this a (hopefully transient) network issue somewhere on the path between you and EPFL.

The 403 when you browse to that URL with firefox is expected: http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin/site.xml would give you something.

All of a sudden I could now get a step further. The installation process stops later
with this error message from Eclipse:

---

Sorry, the problem is at your end (or somewhere between you and EPFL) ... the "all of a sudden" bit should be a clue that this is a transient network issue.

Try installing from a within a different network.
