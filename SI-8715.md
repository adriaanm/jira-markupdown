Modularized jars (scala-xml, scala-parser-combinators) have their own versions, available in the Scala repo in `versions.properties`. It would be extremely useful to publish this file for each release, so that tools (like the uber-build) can retrieve correct version numbers for each scala module.

The `scala-library-all.pom` is hard to consume by tools based on ivy (such as dbuild), and we already publish other properties files, like `compiler.properties`.

I mark this as a blocker, as I'd really like to have this in 2.11.2, but feel free to downgrade if you think it's unrealistic.
In the end, the IDE works around this by using the scala-library-all pom.
