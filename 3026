> Do you have Project => Build Automatically enabled? If not, could you enable it and let me know if that reduces the number of bogus errors you're seeing.

When this bug was first opened the only way to trigger it was to do clean with a subsequent build. Also the bogus errors wouldn't go away with any form of compilation. You needed to close and reopen your projects (and sometimes even then they persisted) in order to have them removed.

During the last couple of weeks things have changed and we also get bogus error messages after incremental compilation (via save). Those error messages disappear after an incremental compilation and they appear again after a clean&build or they might appear again after an incremental build.

For example in a non trivial project we might have a file called exceptions.scala that has the !BadInputException defined. When in another file we use the !BadInputException and save it to compile we will get a bogus error messages saying: "not found: type !BadInputException". If we edit that file and save it again the bogus error message will disappear. Subsequent incremental recompilations of that file might trigger the bug again and make the bogus error message appear but this does not happen 100% of the time. What always triggers this bug is a Clean&Build, if we do a Clean&Build the bogus error message always appears.
