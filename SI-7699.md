Not only does it fail, but there is nothing which can be done in Y2 (e.g. overriding to resolve the ambiguity, even though neither m should even be inherited in Y2, let alone overridable) to make it compile. This is among the consequences of refusing to fix #2568.
```scala
package s {
  trait B1 { private val m = "B1" }
  trait B2 { private[s] val m = "B2" }
}
class Y1 extends s.B1 with s.B2  // compiles
class Y2 extends s.B2 with s.B1  // fails

// ./a.scala:6: error: overriding value m in trait B2 of type String;
//  value m in trait B1 of type String has weaker access privileges; it should not be private
// class Y2 extends s.B2 with s.B1  // fails
//       ^
// one error found
```
Note that if both are private, it compiles. If both are private[s], it fails, but at least it fails understandably and in a way which can be resolved (though the failure to compile is still a bug if the specification is supposed to have any relevance.)
```
./a.scala:5: error: class Y1 inherits conflicting members:
  value m in trait B1 of type String  and
  value m in trait B2 of type String
(Note: this can be resolved by declaring an override in class Y1.)
class Y1 extends s.B1 with s.B2  // compiles
      ^
```
Possibly related to #7475
They are related, but what's at issue here is that we don't mangle package-private or object-private members at all, which means they are not private. In #7475 it is attempting to do the right thing by mangling the private member, but the implementation has bugs -- whereas here we are not even trying to do the right thing.
```scala
package s {
  object o {
    trait A {
      private[this] val m1 = 1
      private       val m2 = 2
      private[A]    val m3 = 3
      private[o]    val m4 = 4
      private[s]    val m5 = 5
    }
    // Here is what that produces:
    // public abstract int s$o$A$$m1();
    // public abstract int s$o$A$$m2();
    // public abstract int s$o$A$$m3();
    // public abstract int m4();
    // public abstract int m5();
  }
}
```
