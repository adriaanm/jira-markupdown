Similarly, for nested objects, where there is no expectation:

{code}
-t1005.scala:6: warning: FromMono has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but Test.FromMono will not be a runnable program.
-  Reason: main method must have exact signature (Array[String])Unit
-  object FromMono{
{code}

Though if the signature is exactly that, it could warn for the reason that the object is not top-level.  Or warn under -Xlint or -Xnoob.
