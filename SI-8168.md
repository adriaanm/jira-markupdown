Steps to reproduce:
1. On a Windows 8 computer go to http://www.scala-lang.org/index.html
2. Click Download
3. Run the installer with default options
4. open Windows advanced settings and review system environmental variables.
5. Edit "Path". Notice that the path added by the Scala installer is written as
C:\Program Files (x86)\scala\\bin
Note the extra backslash
Should be 
C:\Program Files (x86)\scala\bin
Fixed a few days back, just in time for the soon-to-be-released Scala 2.10.4, over in https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/issues/121
