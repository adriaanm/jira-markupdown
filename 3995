I noticed that the hashCode of sets is much simpler.
SetLike.hashCode is just
```scala
this map (_.hashCode) sum
```
If Seqs also had this (or a similar) formula for their hash codes, a fast implementation for Range would be easy. Is it possible to change the implementation for SeqLike.hashCode?

Which brings up a bigger question: Is the implementation of SeqLike.hashCode part of the public API of SeqLike?
