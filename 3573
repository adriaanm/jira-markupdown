And, just to capture a little more information about the problem...

Leaving -Ypmat-debug out of the picture, this line crashes due to this (or similar) bug:

{{ case app @ Apply(x,y,z) => ... }}

When any of x, y or z are there, it crashes.  But this doesn't:

{{ case app @ Apply(_,_,_) => ... }}

And finally, this version avoids the extractor and therefore can't possibly fail:

{{ case app: Apply[_] => ... }}
