Scala 2.12 (both .0 and .1) compiler crashes when trying to compile my project. Specifically, it throws the following exception:

scala.tools.asm.tree.analysis.AnalyzerException: While processing switchwalker/Inspector.inspect
....
Caused by: scala.tools.asm.tree.analysis.AnalyzerException: Error at instruction 350: Incompatible stack heights
....
Caused by: scala.tools.asm.tree.analysis.AnalyzerException: Incompatible stack heights
....
[error] Error while emitting switchwalker/Inspector
[error] While processing switchwalker/Inspector.inspect

The construct that hurts the compiler seems to look something like this:


```scala
def inspect(): Result
{
  var switch: Switch = null
  ....
  try {
  /*** 1 ***/   switch = Switch(...) match {
        case Right(sw) => sw
        case Left(result) => return result
     }//match
     ...
  } catch {
     ....
  /*** 2 ***/ } finally {
      if (switch != null)
         switch.cleanup()
  }//finally

  result
}//inspect


```
Commenting out the assignment in the point marked /*** 1 ******/ (without touching the following "match" clause) or removing the "finally" clause in the point /****** 2 ***/ stops the compiler from crashing. But no other changes in the same file (those I've tried) help.

The project compiles without any problems with Scala 2.11. I could not reproduce the crash with the smaller example project, containing the similar constructs. So I supply the full stack trace and the source file that causes the compiler to crash in the attachment. The points in the source file where the changes can help the compiler to survive are also marked /*** 1 ******/ and /****** 2 ***/.

I also can supply the entire project if required (since it is not secret nor very big), so the crash could be reproduced.
Hi, thanks for the report. I'm trying turn your file into a self-contained example that triggers the crash. In the meantime, you can probably use `-opt:l:none` as a workaround.
Minimized:

```scala
class C {
  def fin(): Unit = ()
  def m(x: Int) = ()
  def inspect: Unit = {
    try {
      m(if (this == null) return else 1) // jump to finally block, `this` on stack
      return                             // jump to finally block, empty stack
    } finally {
      fin()
    }
  }
}
```
This looks not easy to fix unfortunately.

For a `try-finally`, the `finally` block is emitted in 3 copies
- once as a handler, if an exception is thrown in the `try` block (or any `catch` block)
- once for ordinary control flow
- once for `return` statements within the `try` block

`return` statements within the `try` are replaced by a store (if there's a return value) and a jump to the 3rd finally copy (called "cleanup"). This is handled in `genReturn`.

The classfile spec requires the stack to be the same (height and types) for all branches to a location. In the example, the at the first `return`, there's a value on the stack (the receiver of method `m`), at the second `return` there isn't. What we should do is insert `drop` operations until the stack is clear, but we don't keep track of the stack height in our code generator.

In 2.11.x, `returns` were handled differently: the `finally` block was inlined into the `try` block above every `return`.

Ideas welcome, cc @retronym.
