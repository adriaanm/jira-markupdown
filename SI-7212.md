An old email for which I never opened a ticket. It is undesirable that implementing an abstract method with an implementation like sys.error("no implementation yet") should force all subclasses to throw an exception. It is extremely unlikely anyone would want this "most specific type" to be inferred as the return type of a method for which less exceptional return type is already known (i.e. I'm not talking about def ??? which is born in the same location as the exception; I'm talking about any method for which there is an abstract or concrete implementation in a superclass.)

In the following, how does one define foo in class B such that:

 1) class A's foo definitions can be swapped without modifying B
 2) class C compiles

Can you? I can't.  But I should be able to.

  class A {
    def foo = new A
    // def foo = new B
  }

  class B extends A {
    override def foo = sys.error("")
  }

  class C extends B {
    override def foo = new C
  }
{noformat}

I just did that thing where you stare at two identical pieces of test code, identical except that one issues "inferred existential type" at the first line.
{code}
      val ref = new SimpleSpec with Reference with Property {
        type ThisCommandLine = SpecCommandLine
        protected def creator(args: List[String]): ThisCommandLine = new SpecCommandLine(args) 
        //def referenceSpec: Reference = this    // perniciously, the type is required
        def referenceSpec = this                 // not even used, could be ??? here
        override def propMapper = new PropertyMapper(this)
      }
{code}
