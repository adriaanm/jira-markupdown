When passing a Future to another actor, that actor may use the Future's apply, but not it's respond method.

Executing

```scala
import scala.actors._, scala.actors.Actor._, scala.actors.Futures._

{
val a = actor { loop { react { case i:Int => Thread.sleep(5000); reply(i*2) } } }

val f = a !! (3, {case x:Int => x})
actor { f.respond(println) }
}
```

in the REPL results in

```scala
scala.actors.Actor$$$$anon$$1@2389b9bd: caught java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: receive from channel belonging to other actor
java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: receive from channel belonging to other actor
	at scala.actors.Actor$$class.receiveWithin(Actor.scala:495)
	at scala.actors.ActorProxy.receiveWithin(ActorProxy.scala:21)
	at scala.actors.Channel.receiveWithin(Channel.scala:72)
...
```


This is especially problematic if a Future has been mapped, resulting in a Responder which doesn't provide apply():

```scala
val f = a !! (3, {case x:Int => x})
val r = f map { _ + 2 }
```

Because of this, r is now unusable in a normal thread (e.g. main): You can't do r.respond from a normal thread (doing that results in big trouble and doesn't make sense anyway, since respond isn't supposed to return). But you also can't spawn an actor to do something with r because of the problem described above.
