This seems related to: SI-8219

*Reproduce code:*
{code}
  case class Foo[+T[_]](activity:T[Long])
  type Cell[T] = T
  def insertCell(u:Foo[Cell]) = ???
  insertCell(Foo(5))
{code}

*Expected result:*
Type error with line numer.

*Actual result:*
{noformat}
[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Long
[error]  required: ?T
[error] Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
[error]  both method longWrapper in class LowPriorityImplicits of type (x: Long)scala.runtime.RichLong
[error]  and method any2Ensuring in object Predef of type [A](x: A)Ensuring[A]
[error]  are possible conversion functions from Long to ?T
{noformat}

It seems to be related to using a type alias and a long. Those all produce type errors with line numbers:

{code}
  case class Foo2[+T[_]](color:T[String])
  def insertCell2(u:Foo2[Cell]) = ???
  insertCell2(Foo2("color"))

  def insertOption(u:Foo[Option]) = ???
  insertOption(Foo(5))

  def insertOption2(u:Foo2[Option]) = ???
  insertOption2(Foo2("color"))
{code}

Another code sample that produces the same error message without line number:
{code}
  class DefaultType[Name]
  case class Foo[+T[_]](
    activity:T[Long]
  )(t:DefaultType[T[_]])
  Foo(3)(new DefaultType[Option[_]])
{code}

Dup of SI-8219. I'll add this test case to that ticket.

I tried to fix that for 2.11.0 (in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3460) but ran into SI-8230.
Oh, I just realised that SI-8219 is closed. I'll reopen this ticket instead.
