The current implementation of Collection.toArray looks like:
```scala
  def toArray[B >: A]: Array[B] = toList.toArray
```
While this might be elegant, this is ridiculously ineffecient. Do we need to construct a linked list in order to creat an array?

Please adopt some less elegant but more efficient algorithm, maybe something along the lines of:
```scala
  def toArray[B >: A]: Array[B] = {
    val result = new Array[B](size)
    val it = elements
    var pos = 0
    while (it.hasNext) {
      result (pos) = it.next
      pos += 1
    }
    result
  }
```

Yet another response to Sean's comment:[[BR]]
Sean maintains that "toArray" method is only important for compatibility with Java.[[BR]]
If that is so, then why collection constructors in the Scala library only take arrays (varargs) as an argument? I want to write a function-style code, and the only way I can do this is often by using toArray, for example:
```scala
    /** Day => Column Name => Index */
    def table: LHMap[Either[DateTime, String], LHMap[String, Double]]

    /** The sum for each column of the table. */
    lazy val sum: Map[String, Double] = {
      val table = this.table
      if (table.isEmpty) Map() else Map (
        table.values.next.keys.map (name => (name, table.elements.filter(_._1.isLeft).foldLeft(0.0)(_ + _._2(name))))
          .toList.toArray :_*)
    }
```
Yes, I can do also
```scala
    /** The sum for each column of the table. */
    lazy val sum: Map[String, Double] = {
      val table = this.table
      if (table.isEmpty) Map() else new scala.collection.immutable.HashMap ++ (
        table.values.next.keys.map (name => (name, table.elements.filter(_._1.isLeft).foldLeft(0.0)(_ + _._2(name))))
      )
    }
```
but I find it counter-intuitive. Immutable structures are cheaper to create than to update, I would have preferred to have a reasonable Map constructor rather than using "++". But the point of this is that it is very wrong to think that any method, like the "toArray", can be used "only for Java compatibility". There's no telling for what it might be used, and in any case however it is used it should be implemented optimally.
You know, the definition of toArray in Seq is

```scala
  override def toArray[B >: A]: Array[B] = {
    val result = new Array[B](length)
    copyToArray(result, 0)
    result
  }
```

Funny fact about this definition? s/length/size and it works **perfectly** as a generic implementation for toArray in Collection. 

So, in conclusion, this can be fixed in a way that decreases the number of lines of code in the standard library.
