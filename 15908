= problem =

I need to be able to analyse the AST of lifted code and then call it if some requirements are met.

Executing the following snippet
```scala
val code: reflect.Code[String] = reflect.Code.lift("World!")
if (code.tree.isInstanceOf[reflect.Literal])
  println("Hello " + code.code)
```

should yield
```scala
Hello World!
```

= analysis =

Currently this is not possible since the original AST is replaced by the lifted one in the `liftcode` phase. The original code has to be saved somehow.

= enhancement recommendation =

The `Code` class can be extended by an additional attribute holding the original code. `LiftCode.scala` thus has to be extended slightly to pass the original code to `Code`'s constructor.

I attached a small patch for 2.8.1.final. All tests still run successfully.
