Compiler must check for class name clashes with respect to characters translation.

Code like the following should not be compiled:
{code}
class ::: // compiles to $$colon$$colon$$colon.class

class :: {
  class colon // compiles to $$colon$$colon$$colon.class
}
{code}
Duplicate of SI-2806.
The proposal is to prohibit erroneous compilation while Ticket SI-2806 is not solved.

Don't reopen tickets after I close them.  I'm by far the most likely person to fix this and if you go out of your way to antagonize me I will be happy to never fix it.  This is an exact duplicate of 2806, which I opened, and your proposal of "fail" is not sufficiently earth-shaking to justify adding yet more noise to the trac database.

And the fact that "2806 is not solved" is what makes this a duplicate.
