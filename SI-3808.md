I'm trying to figure out whether this is a bug. It comes about when you declare a method to be parameterized on some type T where there must be a typeclass in scope for T (e.g. TC[T]), but **only if you don't require that the method takes an actual parameter of type T**. Example:

This does not compile:


```scala
object PolymorphicBug {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {

    trait TC[I] { def foo : I }

    trait IntIsTC {
      implicit val tci = new TC[Int] { def foo = 1 }
    }

    case class Bar(s : String) {
      def baz[J : TC](i : Int) : String = s + " " + implicitly[TC[J]].foo.toString
    }
    trait Foo { def foodoo(i : String) =  Bar(i) }

    object DSL extends IntIsTC with Foo
    import DSL._
    foodoo("A") baz 2
    //()  --uncomment this line and it will compile
  }
}
```
The error is: "polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type; found [J] String, required: Unit"

Replace the declaration of the baz method as 
```scala
      def baz[J : TC](i : J) : String = s + " " + implicitly[TC[J]].foo.toString
```
And it compiles again.
Sorry - I made a mistake posting the above code - it should be
```scala
trait Foo { def foodoo(i : String) =  Bar(i) }
```
shorter version:

```scala
object Test {
  def meh: Unit = {
    trait TC[I]
    implicit val tci = new TC[Int]{}

    def baz[J : TC] : String = "meh"

    /*val x =*/ baz // should infer baz[Int](tci) -- does the adapt to unit happen too soon?
  }
}
```

this will be fixed as part of #3346
(In r23091) closes #3808. use weaklyCompatible check when inferring type arguments before implicit search to take into account we could do unit-conversion when inference fails under strict compatibility

moved typing indentation to where it belongs, now inliner shuold be able to do its job in implicits as well

no review
