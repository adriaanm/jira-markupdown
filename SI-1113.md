The current implementation of Console.format is defined to return Unit.  This is counter to expectations set by Java's String#format method, which returns a value of type String.  As it stands, format and printf are functionally redundant, with no mechanism for formatting a String without printing it to stdout.

The implementation for Console.format should be changed to the following:

{code}
def format(text: String, args: Any*): String =
  if (text eq null) "null" else
    String.format(text, args.asInstanceOf[scala.runtime.BoxedObjectArray].unbox(args.getClass).asInstanceOf[Array[Object]])
{code}

Correspondingly, the implementation of Console.printf must be changed as well:

{code}
def printf(text: String, args: Any*) {
  out.print(format(text, args:_*))
}
{code}

I can only assume this was the intention, since the current implementation of Console.format returns String value "null" when the input pattern is null.
We'll deprecate {{Console.format}} and introduce {{RichString.format}} without the first parameter instead.

This seems to have been resolved a while back, in that {{Console.format}} was deprecated (and eventually removed), and {{Console.printf}} was updated to match Daniel's suggestion. What's odd is that the infamous "Anonymous User" reopened this ticket, when this should have likely remained closed.
