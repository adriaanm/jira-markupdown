It's either my lack of understanding what private should do, but to me the following is pretty surprising

http://ideone.com/FaQkD

  class A {
    val log = 1
  }

  trait B {
    private val log = ""
  }

  trait BB extends B {
    //no way to use log
//    log
  }

  trait C extends A with BB {
  }

However in the REPL there are some scenarios where it does work as expected.
