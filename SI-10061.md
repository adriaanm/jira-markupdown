m.getDeclaredAnnotations is an empty array and should not be. This would seem to be a bug as I can't imagine this is the correct behaviour.

{code:scala}
import scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

case class ComplexAnnotation(p1: String, p2: Int, p3: Boolean, p4: (_) => Boolean) extends StaticAnnotation

class TestModel {

  @ComplexAnnotation("test", 4, false, (any: Any) => {
    true
  })
  var var1 = 4

  def reflect() = {
    this.getClass.getDeclaredMethods.foreach(m => {
      println("Method: -")
      println(m)
      m.getDeclaredAnnotations.foreach(a => {
        println("Annotations: -")
        println(a)
      })
    })
  }

}
{code}

Also worth adding: -

Trying to reflect like this also fails using - import scala.annotation.Annotation, import scala.reflect.runtime.{universe => ru}

{code:scala}
    ru.typeOf[TestModel].decls.collect {
      case m: Any => {
        println("method: -")
        println(m)
        m
      }
    }.withFilter {
      _.annotations.nonEmpty
    }.map { m => {
      println("method with annotations: -")
      println(m)
      m
    }}
{code}

This is a known issue: Scala-defined annotations are never emitted as Java-style annotations in the classfile, and therefore not visible to Java reflection. If you need an annotation to be visible to Java reflection, it needs to be defined in Java.

What you're looking for would be {{ClassfileAnnotation}}, not {{StaticAnnotation}}, but it's not implemented, you'll get a compile-time warning.
