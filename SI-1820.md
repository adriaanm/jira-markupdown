The following code fails to compile.

```scala
import scala.continuations.ControlContext._

object Test19 {
  def shifted: Int @suspendable = shift { (k: Int => Unit) => () }
  def test1(b: => Boolean) = {
    reset {
      if (b) shifted
    }
  }
}
```

```scala
test/files/pos/rich19.scala:7: error: found cps expression in non-cps position
      if (b) shifted
             ^
test/files/pos/rich19.scala:7: error: then and else parts must both be cps code or neither of them
      if (b) shifted
      ^
two errors found
```

I don't think it should be necessary for the then and else parts of an if statement to both be CPS code.
(In r20817) use newly added typer hooks for lub and BYVALmode, giving much more precise typing. fixes #1929, #1808, #1820. review by community.
