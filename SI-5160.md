Code that should work but doesn't:

{code:test_placeholder.scala}
class Foo[T] {
  val x: T = _
  def foo(x: T = _) {}
}
{code}

Result:

```
test_placeholder.scala:4: error: unbound placeholder parameter
  def foo(x: T = _) {}
                 ^
one error found
```

Default values for params should work exactly like values specified for fields.  As it happens, you can work around this like this:

```
class Foo[T] {
  val x: T = _
  def foo(x: T = null.asInstanceOf[T]) {}
}
```

But this casting of 'null' (which works even if T is primitive) is highly non-obvious and clearly a kludge, probably non-portable as well.
What is the meaning of "should" in "Default values for params should work exactly like values specified for fields."? Is it specified that way, or is it an appeal to personal aesthetics?

The part that isn't wontfix is a duplicate of #4437.
