Each method needs complete scaladoc, including the valid range of values for Futures.awaitAll timeout - i.e. from purusing the source, it appears 0 will not result in an indefinite wait (like java.lang.Object.wait(0) ) but will instead timeout immediately. Passing in larger timeouts such as java.lang.Long.Max_Value yield a IllegalArgumentException "Illegal execution time."
as it appears the value is added to System.currentTimeMillis() and if this overflows into a negative number, bad things happen. The valid inputs must be specified in the scaladoc.
(In r20256) Documented scala.actors.Futures API. Closes SI-2506. Review by dubochet.
