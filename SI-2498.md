I see this code in scala.Ordering object.

 trait FloatOrdering extends Ordering[Float] {
   def compare(x: Float, y: Float) =
     if (x < y) -1
     else if (x == y) 0
     else 1
 }
 implicit object Float extends FloatOrdering

 trait DoubleOrdering extends Ordering[Double] {
   def compare(x: Double, y: Double) =
     if (x < y) -1
     else if (x == y) 0
     else 1
 }

They should be delegating to java.lang.{Float, Double}.compare()
instead, since the implemented ordering is inconsistent for some
values:

scala> 5.0 < Double.NaN
res0: Boolean = false

scala> Double.NaN < 5.0
res1: Boolean = false

scala> 0.0 < -0.0
res2: Boolean = false

scala> -0.0 < 0.0
res3: Boolean = false
You're right that this should be done (and it's done in r19160) but based on your examples you are laboring under a misapprehension.  Those comparison examples won't change, those are primitive comparisons which don't use an Ordering.  If you use the Ordering now, NaN does the right thing but -0.0 and 0.0 still come out equal because of SI-2378.
