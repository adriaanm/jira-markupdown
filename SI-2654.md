Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19673-b20091116132603 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

Given A.scala, B.scala
```scala
class A
class B extends A
```

 1. Compile
 1. Change A.scala to
```scala
class A {
	private def x = 5
}
```
 1. Mark A.scala modified.  B.scala is also recompiled.  I can't think of a reason why this should happen.  It is not an error to recompile B.scala of course, but I'm pretty sure it is unnecessary and is probably a common case that should be fixed.
