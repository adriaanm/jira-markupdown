See this old and forgotten issue mentioned on the mailing lists: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/scala-internals/method$20transpose$20is$20broken/scala-internals/ug-eJ1OUEMI/ioCpv3KobysJ

In short: transpose shouldn't throw an exception in the input collections have different sizes:
{code}
scala> List(List(1, 2, 3), List(4, 5)).transpose
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: transpose requires all collections have the same size 
{code}
