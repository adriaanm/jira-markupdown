Fascinating, since the self-type a) does not specify any type and b) is never referenced, yet it is sufficient to cause miscompilation.

I think the test in superaccessors should be more like
```scala
-      def isSelfType = (host.thisSym != host) && {
+      def isSelfType = !(host.tpe <:< host.typeOfThis) && {
```
Not tested though.
