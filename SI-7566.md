Execute all the usual steps to get rid of deprecated elements whose times have come.
(This means deprecated in 2.11 or before.)

To mention a few:

- Actors
- ThreadPoolTaksSupport
@SethTisue I think most removals in 2.12 are actually cancelled because due to the special compatibility rules to keep 2.11 and 2.12 closer to each other.
True. Maybe we can keep an open mind about not interpreting those rules *too* mechanically though. At least, I hope I won't get in trouble with Adriaan for saying so :-)
