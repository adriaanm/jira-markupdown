`PartialFunction` doesn't have a simple expression of its type the way that `FunctionN` types do. It's possible to provide a syntactic sugar definition without compiler additions, something such as the following in `Predef`:

```scala
  type =>?[-A, +B] = PartialFunction[A, B]
  type ⇒?[-A, +B] = PartialFunction[A, B]
```

This makes the following declarations identical:

```scala
  def foo: PartialFunction[P, Q]
  def foo: P =>? Q
  def foo: P ⇒? Q
```

Other possibilities include `=?>` or `?>` or all sorts of other options. Please feel free to offer other opinions.
