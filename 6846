we cannot assign the correct `OVERRIDE` flags to default getters. one and the same default getter might sometimes override another one, sometimes not, example below.

this is a consequence of the fact that we allow overriding defaults without `override` modifiers.

so the fix in [9f9932bd20](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/9f9932bd20) is left in place, a comment is added in [5d90d00108](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5d90d00108)
```scala
trait A1 { def f(x: Int): Int }
trait A2 extends A1 { def f(x: Int = 1): Int }

trait B { self: A1 =>
  def f(x: Int = 2): Int = x
}

object t {
  new A1 with B // here, B.f$default$1 should not have an 'override' flag
  new A2 with B // here, B.f$default$1 would need an 'override' flag
}
```
