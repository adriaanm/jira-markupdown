Since -Xprint-icode is a PhasesSetting, it should be prepared to emit files for multiple phases, such as -Xprint-icode:icode,dce.

To distinguish the output files, it should encode either the phase name or the phase id in the file name.
The functionality you're looking for is already provided by https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/cb19813bcb7d8f583e3adbe471fb9bcbcdf1f810 

In detail, -Xprint-icode isn't the only way to obtain .icode files, that commit allows -Xprint:<any-icode-phase> to emit .icode files right after the chosen icode-phase. Very useful when debugging the old optimizer.
