Enhancement request to add support for withDefault and withDefaultValue for mutable maps (move from immutable Map to general Map).

Currently:

```scala
scala> Map(1 -> "b").withDefaultValue("-")
res1: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,java.lang.String] = Map((1,b))

scala> collection.mutable.Map(1 -> "b").withDefaultValue("-")
<console>:6: error: value withDefaultValue is not a member of scala.collection.mutable.Map[Int,java.lang.String]
       collection.mutable.Map(1 -> "b").withDefaultValue("-")
                                        ^
```

The 2.8.0 comment for withDefault in http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/Map.html suggests that withDefault could move to the general map.

See http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/withDefault-and-withDefaultValue-for-mutable-maps-tp2528937p2529198.html.
(In r23106) Fixes #3829. Review by extempore.
The following is in scala/collection/Map.scala and does not seem appropriate anymore:

```scala
/** The same map with a given default function !!! todo: move to general maps? */ 
```

There is also a similar warning in scala/collection/mutable/Map.scala and you may consider removing it too. If you decide to keep it, please leave it as an internal comment instead of scaladoc.
