scala> object Foo { def goo = 9; def foo = 8 }
defined object Foo

scala> import Foo.goo
import Foo.goo

scala> object Foo { def goo = 9 }
defined object Foo

scala> import Foo._
import Foo._

scala> goo
<console>:15: error: reference to goo is ambiguous;
it is imported twice in the same scope by
import Foo._
and import Foo.goo
              goo
              ^

scala> import Foo.goo
import Foo.goo

scala> goo
res1: Int = 9
```

Or viewed this way, it's hard to tell whether it's a feature:

```scala
scala> object Foo { def goo = 9; def foo = 8 }
defined object Foo

scala> import Foo._
import Foo._

scala> object Foo { def goo = 9 }
defined object Foo

scala> foo
res0: Int = 8
```
