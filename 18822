When compiling Akka I with 2.11.0-M8 I get a compilation error without line numbers or file information in one of the tests.
```scala
[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Any
[error]  required: AnyRef
[error] Note: Any is not implicitly converted to AnyRef.  You can safely
[error] pattern match `x: AnyRef` or cast `x.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]` to do so.
[error] one error found
[error] (test:compile) Compilation failed
[error] Total time: 68 s, completed Jan 31, 2014 4:45:55 PM
```

I've also tried with this SNAPSHOT version (2.11.0-20140131.015148-534) and it fails in the same way.

It might be that it's not one of the test frameworks that are using macros in a bad way, but I've "minimized" the problem to a standalone project.
