Thanks for the explanation, Adriaan!

I'm beginning to wish Scala's default would be final, with some keyword to allow extension, perhaps {{open class Foo}}. Maybe in Dotty? :-)

BTW, given the explanation, is there any hope this issue having any other resolution that "Won't Fix", i.e. why it's still open?
