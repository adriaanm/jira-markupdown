{code}
def object : Any
def stack = new scala.collections.immutable.Stack[Any]
stack.push(object)
{code}

This will complain about an ambiguous reference to an overloaded definition, because it can't tell whether or not object is a sequence.

I understand that traits like Map get around this by requiring two or more elements to the sequence version of the method.

I have to say that this strikes me as being rather ugly, its like the authors are so determined to use an overloaded method that they are ignoring a simpler and cleaner approach.

I think it make far more sense to follow the Java collections approach of push() and pushAll() to push an entire sequence.  Sometimes overloading causes more confusion than its worth.
