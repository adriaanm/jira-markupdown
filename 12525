Think of AnyRef as an alias for Object:
```scala
scala> type Foo = String
defined type alias Foo

scala> new Foo
res0: String = ""

scala> :power

scala> val x = symbolOf[AnyRef]
x: $r.intp.global.TypeSymbol = type AnyRef

scala> x.isAliasType
res6: Boolean = true

scala> x.tpe.dealias
res7: $r.intp.global.Type = Object
```

Assuming that you didn't find any case where something compiled with AnyRef, but was rejected when using Object (or the other way around), I'd say that this isn't a bug.

I guess the main question is: Should we prefer displaying AnyRef over Object? Always, or are there any exceptions?
