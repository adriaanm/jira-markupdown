For some reason the exception was cut off in the example, should have been:
```scala
Caused by: org.hibernate.AnnotationException: Referenced property not a (One|Many)ToOne: no.officenet.origo.calendar.domain.model.calendarentry.RoutableEntity.calendarEntry in mappedBy of no.officenet.origo.calendar.domain.model.calendarentry.CalendarEntry.routableEntity
```
