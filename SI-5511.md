Reflection appears to be broken on both M1 and M2. 

This Stackoverflow thread indicates that reflection was working in a snapshot build in October:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7477248/what-reflection-capabilities-can-we-expect-from-scala-2-10

```java
object Test extends Application {
  override def main(args: Array[String]) { 
    System.out.println("Running")
    case class Foo(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int)
    val props = reflect.mirror.classToType(classOf[Foo]).members.filter(_.isTerm)
    props foreach System.out.println
  }
}
```

via terminal invoking bin/scala directly:
/path/to/.scala-2.10.0-M2/bin/scala Test.scala

yields:
"java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name"

via Scala-IDE 2.10.2 (downloaded this AM) I get:
"Scala reflection not available on this platform"

I would love to test reflection in 2.10 but am unable to do so.  Feedback appreciated, if reflection is not yet ready/working, please post in the release notes; otherwise, if it is in fact working, I'd love to know what is missing from my setup and/or wrong with the test case (that compiles just fine).

Thanks!
As of 90d2bee45b this example works, but any call to getSimpleName can still crash us, and there are still classloader issues: at the moment you have to pass -nobootcp to run this from the command line.
```
% pscala -nobootcp Test
Running
constructor Foo$3
method _3
method copy$default$3
method copy$default$2
method _2
method _1
[etc]
```
