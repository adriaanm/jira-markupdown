I guess the reason is the factory method in the companion object:
```scala
final <synthetic> object Bob extends java.lang.Object with () => $$iw.$$iw.Bob with ScalaObject {
[...]
  case <synthetic> def apply(): $$iw.$$iw.Bob = new $$iw.this.Bob()
[...]
}
```

The solution is probably to mark the companion object deprecated as well.
