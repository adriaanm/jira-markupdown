Hi.

I should get time to reproduce this in Java this afternoon, just entering some scheduled downtime to do some load testing.  

Thanks,

> OK, I could finally reproduce the failed test case (`Could not find a setter for property oCode`). However, I think this is not a bug of the scala compiler: when looking at the annotations of the classfile `DummyEntity.class`, they all seem to be correct (i used "jclasslib" to inspect the classfiles):

>  * methods `setIsoCode`, `isoCode` and `isoCode_eq$$` have no annotations
>  * field `isoCode` has no annotations
