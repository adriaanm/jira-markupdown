I have the following case classes partially using Unicode:
{code}
sealed abstract class Expr
sealed abstract class LocationPath extends Expr
case object Ʈ extends Ʈ()
case class Ʈ(steps: Expr*) extends LocationPath
case class π(steps: Expr*) extends LocationPath
{code}
Inside {{LocationPath}} I have methods like
{code}
def ↘(pos: Int)
{code}
for path construction.

Now, I defined a map with key type {{LocationPath}}.
{code}
val m: Map[LocationPath, Message)
{code}
The weird thing is the following:

  1. {{println(m isDefinedAt (Ʈ↘(1)↘(3)))}}
  2. {{println(m.keys find (_ == Ʈ↘(1)↘(3)))}}

Output of (1) is ``false_ but (2) outputs a Message object.

Referring to a conversation with Paul Phillips:
{{find}} on the keys just goes through them looking for one which returns equals, but {{isDefinedAt}} on the map will use the {{hashCode}} and only look in that bucket.  In other words, you have equal objects with unequal hashCodes.

This is a not-too-surprising bug which I expect is related to unicode and the fact that {{productPrefix}} (the name of the case class) is used in the generation of the hash code.
I am no longer sure if this is really a bug due to Unicode!

I guess my problem was that my case classes contained variable input parameters, like:
{code}
case class π(steps: Expr*)
{code}

I substituted all {{Expr*}} by {{List[Expr]}} and it works fine now.  Unfortunately beforehand I also substituted all unicode characters by ascii characters.  So I can no longer tell if this issue is related to unicode characters or to variable input parameters.

If you can tell that this issue is not related to {{Expr*}}, I'll set up a little code snippet to reconstruct the issue discussed here.
