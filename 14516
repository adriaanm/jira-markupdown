2.7.5 final
```scala
val arr= Array("a", "b", "c")
println(arr)
```

This prints something useless and not intuitive like [Ljava.lang.String;@6af2f0d0.
It would be great to make the default toString on arrays be informative.
Java created Arrays.toString as a work around for this but it's not a seamless solution (pain to use everytime and you need to know about the method in the first place)
