There is already a warning for unused values, fields, imports etc. what no warning for unused variables bound in a pattern match:

```scala
scala> def f(x: Any): Unit = x match { case y => println(x) }
f: (x: Any)Unit
```

`y` is never used, thus the compiler should warn about it.
I initially did that, then backed off in terror from the hundreds if not thousands of warnings the compiler emitted. The prevailing style inside the compiler involves a lot of pattern matches like this:
```scala
      case ValDef(mods, name, tpt, rhs) =>
        ctx // we use the symbol to add fields
      case DefDef(mods, name, tparams, vparamss, tpt, rhs) =>
        // let's do nothing!
```
That's ten unused warnings, now multiply by one billion. Maybe this problem is unique to the compiler.
There are a few specific examples for improving unused warning.

Another request: unused parameters, especially implicits, and also when shadowed by locals.

Don't warn if param is mandated by superclass API, or if param is deprecated.
