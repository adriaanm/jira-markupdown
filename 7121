I got suckered there by a) the fact that flatten used to be external and b) the comment at the top of GenericTraversableTemplate says
```scala
A template class for companion objects of ``regular`` collection classes
```
You'd think I'd know better than to believe documentation (not to mention it should be hard for me to forget what GenericTraversableTemplate does) but some days are like that.
