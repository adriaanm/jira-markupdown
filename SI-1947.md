I do not found that it's legal in specification. But I found it's legal at least for trunk version. I mean that List.scala uses this feature. May be it's early to ask about it, but It's important, I think.
Ok, may be you're right. 
But I'm also right.
I mean syntax summary, which is more important for parser then all specification.
{code}
BlockStat ::= Import
               | [‘implicit’ | ‘lazy’] Def
               | {LocalModifier} TmplDef
               | Expr1
{code}

There is no annotations before Def here. So I think about local definitions, that it couldn't have annotations.
Ah.  Take a look at SI-1826, which I reopened 5 weeks ago after I wrote a new scala parser.  The one you're reporting is only one of many.
Hm... I looked at file SyntaxSummary.tex, and last change was 5 weeks ago:
imaier: fixed syntax summary for LocalModifier? (SI-1826)
And annotations for local definitions didn't added.
It's possible that SI-1826 fixed, but SI-1947 is not.
