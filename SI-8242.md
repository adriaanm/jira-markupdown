trait A[@specialized (Int) T] {
  def get: T
  def check(t: T): Boolean  
}

class Bug[@specialized (Int) T](val a: A[T]) {
  def aGet = a.get
  def getCheck() = a.check(a.get) 
}

In  Bug$mcI$sp class, aGet correctly receives aGet$mcI$sp method with calls to get$mcI$sp, but getCheck method isn't overridden - so ends up using check and get methods with boxing, instead of using check$mcI$sp and get$mcI$sp methods.
I.e. methods that call specialized methods, but don't have specializable argument/return type should be overridden in specialized classes.
Technically speaking, this is according to specification ([SIP-9|http://www.scala-lang.org/old/sid/9]):

Section 3.1 Member specialization:

Not all members of a class are specialized. Currently, specialized variants of a member m are created only when mâ€™s type contains at least one specialized naked type parameter, or an array of a naked specialized type parameter.
