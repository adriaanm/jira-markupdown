It looks like it will require something more than a smarter printer, as 2.6.1-RC-1 seems to be okay with the following input:

  {code}
scala> val $$colon$$minus$$greater = 3;
$$colon$$minus$$greater : scala.Int = 3
{code}

So perhaps the thing to do is to add a new "real name" property somewhere to variables (if it doesn't already exist).
