Let's say one wished to find out via reflection (or with direct compiler internals access - the problem isn't limited to reflection) which of an abstract class's methods require implementations. This seems unambitious and realistic. How is one expected to go about it?
{code}
abstract class A           { def f: Int = 1 }
abstract class B extends A { def f: Int     }
abstract class C extends B

/**

// This returns the concrete f owned by A
scala> typeOf[C] member TermName("f")
res0: $r.intp.global.Symbol = method f 

// This returns nothing
scala> typeOf[C] decl TermName("f")
res1: $r.intp.global.Symbol = <none>

// And therefore inspecting all members and all decls of C we
// are never shown a deferred member.

scala> new C { }
<console>:37: error: object creation impossible, since there is a deferred declaration of method f in class B of type => Int which is not implemented in a subclass
              new C { }
                  ^

**/
{code}
The only way to obtain the deferred member is to call decls on all the base types.
{code}
typeOf[C].baseTypeSeq.toList flatMap (_ decl TermName("f") alternatives) filter (_.isDeferred)
res22: List[$r.intp.global.Symbol] = List(method f)
{code}
And then you're still not done, because that net will scoop up every deferred member, even ones for which a qualifying concrete implementation exists. So you have to reimplement all the logic for what overrides what when, and maybe there's someone on earth who has a chance at doing that correctly but it's a lonely club. For example, if the deferred f's owner is a trait, then a concrete implementation is okay even if it's defined in one of f's direct parents. But if the owner is an abstract class, then another implementation is required.
As you have shown, you can't answer this question by interrogating `member` or `overrideChain`'; they both respect the "concrete always overrides deferred" rule.

It seems you are asking for `RefChecksTransformer#checkAllOverrides` to be refactored to expose this logic.

Here's the copy/paste version:

{code}
abstract class A           { def f: Int = 1 }
abstract class B extends A { def f: Int     }
abstract class C extends B

    )
  )

  def javaErasedOverridingSym(clazz: Symbol, sym: Symbol): Symbol =

        def uncurryAndErase(tp: Type): Type = {

        }
        val tp1: Type = uncurryAndErase(clazz.thisType.memberType(sym))
        val tp2: Type = uncurryAndErase(clazz.thisType.memberType(other))
        enteringPhase(findPhaseWithName("erasure"))(tp1 matches tp2)
      })

  def abstractDecls(clazz: Symbol): List[Symbol] = {
    val result = collection.mutable.Buffer[Symbol]()
    def loop(bc: Symbol): Unit = {
      for (decl <- bc.info.decls) {
        if (decl.isDeferred && !ignoreDeferred(clazz, decl)) {
          val impl = decl.matchingSymbol(clazz.thisType, admit = VBRIDGE)
          if (impl == NoSymbol || (decl.owner isSubClass impl.owner)) {
            result += decl
          }
        }
      }
      if (bc.superClass hasFlag ABSTRACT)
        loop(bc.superClass)
    }
    loop(clazz)
    result.toList
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(abstractDecls(symbolOf[C]))
  }
}
