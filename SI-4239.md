=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

In Eclipse: Open Scala project. Make the following changes to Types.scala. Was:
```scala
   object rawToExistential extends TypeMap {
    def apply(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
      case TypeRef(pre, sym, List()) if isRawIfWithoutArgs(sym) =>
        val eparams = typeParamsToExistentials(sym, sym.typeParams)
        existentialAbstraction(eparams, typeRef(pre, sym, eparams map (_.tpe)))
      case _ =>
        mapOver(tp)
    }
  }
```
Now:
```scala
 object rawToExistential extends TypeMap {
    private var expanded = immutable.Set[Symbol]()
    def apply(tp: Type): Type = tp match {
      case TypeRef(pre, sym, List()) if isRawIfWithoutArgs(sym) =>
        if (expanded contains sym) AnyRefClass.tpe
        else try {
          expanded += sym
          val eparams = typeParamsToExistentials(sym, sym.typeParams)
          existentialAbstraction(eparams, typeRef(pre, sym, eparams map (_.tpe)))
        } finally {
          expanded -= sym
        }
      case _ =>
        mapOver(tp)
    }
  }
```
Build. You get a huge set of invalidated symbols. I attach a file with a partial subset. I could not finish this because simply printing the change sets too too long.


=== What is the expected behavior? ===



=== What do you see instead? ===

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:
  - Java:
  - Operating system: 
So in Typers I managed to reduce it to this example:
```scala
class Foos {
  class Bar(val a: Int)
}
```

which gives:
```scala
Changes: Map(class Foos -> List(), class Foos$$Bar -> List(Changed(Definition(Foos$$Bar.<init>))[constructor Foos$$Bar changed from (arg$$outer: Foos,a: Int)Foos$$Bar to (arg$$outer: Foos,a: Int)Foos$$Bar flags: <method>]))
```

Seems to me like a consequence of r24262.

I will try to reduce the Types case as well.
I knew I've seen that before. This is a duplicate of #3140.
Created #4245 for the Typers issue, and closing this one as it is a duplicate.
