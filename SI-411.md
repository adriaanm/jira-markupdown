I received the following error in the attached code when compiled under Scala 2.6.1
/Users/eengbrec/NetBeansProjects/TypeError/src/ScalaApplication5/Main.scala:40: error: type mismatch;
 found   : RationalSystem2.this.N
 required: RationalSystem2.this.I
    def unary_- : N = apply(-numerator, denominator)  // using non-overrided negate
one error found

When an implementation is specified for unary_- in RationalInteger then the overridden type is correctly picked up by the compiler, however when unary_- is abstract in RationalInteger, the compiler does not pick up the overridden type and issues the above type error.
That's unfortunately according to spec. Concrete definitions always override abstract ones, even if the abstract definition occurs in a subclass. It's not possible to change this, because it's a fundamental aspect of mixin composition.
