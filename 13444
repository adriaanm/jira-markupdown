List has several methods that not exist in Seq. These methods should be pulled to Seq (or dropped from List), because many people program with interfaces (Seq) and not concrete classes (List), and API of List and Seq should be similar.
```scala
::
:::
indices
init
takeRight
dropRight
splitAt
span
break
reverseMap
remove
partition
sort
count
zip
zipWithIndex
zipAll
union
--
-
removeDuplicates
```

I've reported about zipWithIndex in scala/bug#898.
