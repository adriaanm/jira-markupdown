Right now (scala 2.8 nightly) it is impossible to have a default argument for pass-by-name parameters. E.g. the following code
{code}
def f(a: => Int = 10) = 1
{code}
produces error:
{code}
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(10)
 required: => Int
       def f(a: => Int =10) = 1
                        ^
{code}
But there is no way to specify something of type "=>Int" currently.
