This problem only occurs with 2.7.0-rc1, it compiled fine with 2.6.1.

I am attaching a zip with 3 files that show the problem but basically the following:

import package2.Bar

case class CaseFoo(entities: Set[Bar])

gives an error like:

[WARNING] /home/ijuma/workspace/src/main/scala/package1/Foo.scala:5: error: not found: type Bar
[WARNING] case class CaseFoo(entities: Set[Bar])
[WARNING]                                  ^
[WARNING] one error found

This happens even though package2.Bar does exist and this is shown in the attached files because in the same file there's:

class Foo(entities: Bar)

And no compiler errors are given for that. One workaround is to qualify the name:

case class CaseFoo(entities: Set[package2.Bar])

Note that this problem does not occur if the file Foo2.scala is removed from package1 even though it's not related to the other files in any way.
fixed in r13948 (and 2.7.0-RC2)
