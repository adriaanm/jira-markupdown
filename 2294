Sorry about the bad formatting in the previous note. I'll attach a separate text file.

I'll also attach a file that includes an implementation of climbing an inheritance hierarchy for an accessible member. No warranties -- it's been years since I wrote or looked at this code, but I think it's OK. For whatever it's worth. Feel free to use/modify/whatever this class, no strings attached. (I'm its author.) The method of interest is findInPublicScope(Method m).

Thanks again for Scala.
