The Presentation Compiler wrongly says that both members in the object are not accessible at the point of completion.

{code}
package test

object Compat {
  final val CONST_STRING = "constant"
  lazy val foo = 4
}

class Foo {
  Compat.CONST_STRING // its 'accessible' flag is false
  Compat.foo // its 'accessible' flag is false
}
{code}

calling 'askTypeCompletion' in the two cases will return the two object members, but both are flagged as inaccessible at the point of completion.

Fixed in [9d1bc68|https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/9d1bc68].

Still needs to be backported to 2.9.x
