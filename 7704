@ijuma, that helps somewhat but performance still suffers unless the inliner gets smarter about which null-checks are redundant. The following shows that: https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/tree/SI-5850

The type-flow analysis should track non-nullness. I was planning to update the TFA anyway (to also track whether a type is exact, ie after new). Only then can this bug be closed.
