(This is with macro paradise 2.0.1)

The following fails with an obscure error message:

```scala
import scala.annotation.{StaticAnnotation, Annotation}
import scala.reflect.macros.Context


class qqq(val count: Int)  extends Annotation with StaticAnnotation {
  def macroTransform(annottees: Any*):Any = macro qqq.qqqImpl

}

object qqq {

  def qqqImpl(c: Context)(annottees: c.Expr[Any]*):c.Expr[Any] = ???

}
```

```scala
[error] /Users/dlwh/src/breeze/macros/src/main/scala/breeze/macros/qqq.scala:9: an expression of type Null is ineligible for implicit conversion
[error]   def macroTransform(annottees: Any*):Any = macro qqq.qqqImpl
[error]          
```

That didn't use to be the case!
This is not specific to macro annotations. For example, this will also spuriously fail to compile:

```scala
import scala.reflect.macros.Context
import scala.language.experimental.macros

class qqq(count: Int) {
  def macroTransform(annottees: Any*):Any = macro qqq.qqqImpl
}

object qqq {
  def qqqImpl(c: Context)(annottees: c.Expr[Any]*):c.Expr[Any] = ???
}
```

The key here is that the object that defines a macro impl has a companion with a constructor that takes a primitive. If you rename either the object or its companion, everything will start working again.
@adriaanm what's the correct course of action here?
