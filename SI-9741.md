```scala
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_77).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> trait T { def copy():Any }
defined trait T

scala> case class A() extends T
<console>:12: error: class A needs to be abstract, since method copy in trait T of type ()Any is not defined
       case class A() extends T
                  ^

```

I expect A will implement `T#copy` method automatically, however, this does not compile.
This is a duplicate of #5122. The compiler behaviour is unlikely to change here, you have to manually implement `copy` in this case.
There are [alternatives](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/blob/master/examples/src/main/scala/shapeless/examples/basecopy.scala).
