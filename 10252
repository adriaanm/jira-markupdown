bq. This might also be compatible with the other scenario I observed â€” spurious failures from `dot`. In my case, I observe (with GraphViz 2.34.0 and 2.36.0) the memory corruptions below inside GraphViz (not due to scaladoc).
bq. If graphviz produce no output or recognizably garbled output, then ignoring the standard error would be OK. However, since in this case dot just crashes and exits, it's still easy to detect something's wrong **without** looking at the standard error.

I tried that too -- the problem is that some of the build machines are quite slow, and package diagrams can easily take 10s to generate. Setting a timeout below 10s will prevent diagrams for large packages (arguably the most important ones). On the other hand, waiting 10 times 10 seconds (before scaladoc gives up generating diagrams) is too much. Tbh, knowing how much time went into fine-tuning this interaction with dot, I'd rather just live with the issue.
