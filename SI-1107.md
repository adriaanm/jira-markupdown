The compiler crashes with "no-symbol does not have owner" when compiling the following two files:

```scala
sealed trait Top
sealed trait Sub extends Top

trait C
{
   private object P extends Sub
}
```

```scala
object O
{
   def d(t: Top) =
      t match
      {
         case s: Sub => true
         case _ => false
      }
}
```

The code compiles without error using 2.7.0-final and 2.7.1-RC1.
The error occurs with 2.7.1-RC2, 2.7.1-final, and the nightly from July 12 (r15535).
The error/stack trace using the nightly build is attached.

Any of the following will produce successful compilation:

 * Put O in the same file as the traits
 * Remove the private modifier from object P
 * Pull P out of C
 * Remove sealed from Top or Sub
 * Make C an object or a class
 * Make P a trait or a class
See #1722 for a bug upon which this bug's edifice rests.
Although this bug is clearly related to #1722, I seem to have fixed it in r17228 without actually fixing #1722, so we must presume "edifice" to be inaccurate.  I'm crossing my fingers that any minute now my debugging process will cease to include the sacrifice of a goat under the light of a harvest moon.
