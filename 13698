It appears that compilation error messages generated when running a scala script (using Scala 2.7.1.final on Ubuntu) are printed to standard out rather than standard error. (scalac, on the other hand, prints compilation errors to standard error.)

For example, if I get a compilation error when running "broken.scala" below, I don't want the output to end up in "result.txt", but printed to standard error:

  $$ scala broken.scala > result.txt
