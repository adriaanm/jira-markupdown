The current actors library makes it pretty much impossible to use a scheduler other than the default one because it frequently creates new actors, especially ActorProxies when messages are received from non-actor threads, that use the default scheduler.  Furthermore, changing the default scheduler doesn't work very well because (1) an FJTaskScheduler2 object is eagerly created when Scheduler is instantiated, and (2) there are other pieces of Scheduler that are very tightly bound to FJTaskScheduler2.

Attached is a patch that I believe corrects these deficiencies.  The biggest change is that it alters the implicit creation of actors so that they will use the same scheduler as the actor causing them to be created.

I also refactored Scheduler a bit so that it lazily instantiates the FJTaskScheduler2, given user code a chance to provide an alternate implementation.  I also moved timer from Actor to IScheduler, so that each scheduler has its own timer and can control it.

These modifications have allowed me to write actors with daemon-like behavior.

I ran the partest suite against my modified version of the library, and it completed with the same failures as the current subversion repository.

A patch is attached. 
i would like to vote for this bug. i was having similar problems with the timer code in 2.7.2.
