The compiler allows to define this
```scala
class A[T](foo: T => Map[Int, Int] = (_: T) => Map.empty)
```

which implies that it infered that `Map.empty` to be of type `Map[Int, Int]`, if we instanciate `new A[String]()` the compilation fails with 
```scala
cmd9.sc:1: polymorphic expression cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : [T]T => scala.collection.immutable.Map[Nothing,Nothing]
 required: ? => Map[Int,Int]
```
