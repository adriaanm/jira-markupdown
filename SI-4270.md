=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

File1.scala
```scala
package other {
  trait LowPriImplicits {
    implicit def lstr2int(x : String) = {
      Console.println("ZOMG")
      x.toInt
    }
  }
  trait MyImplicits {
     implicit def str2int(x : String) = x.toInt
  }
}

package object test extends other.MyImplicits {}

```

File2.scala
```scala
package test;

object Foo {
  def str2int = null
  def test : Int = "5"
}
```

Then when running scalac File1.scala File2.scala things compile successfully.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
From what I understand from reading the SLS, implicits are only applicable if they can be accessed on the current scope without any prefix.  Shadowing should prevent them from being used in the current scope, however it appears that only implicits can shadow implicits.

When changing file2 to the following:
```scala
package test;

object Foo {
  implicit def str2int = null
  def test : Int = "5"
}
```

Now when running scalac:
```scala
jsuereth@jsuereth-laptop:~/projects/tmp/fun$$ scalac *.scala
File2.scala:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : java.lang.String("5")
 required: Int
  def test : Int = "5"
                   ^
one error found
```

=== What do you see instead? ===
Things successfully compile and they should not (according to spec).


=== Additional information ===
SLS 7.2 states:

"First, eligible are all identifiers x that can be accessed at
the point of the method call without a prefix and that denote an implicit definition
(ï¿½7.1) or an implicit parameter"

The implicit lookup rules appear to be filtering the available scope such that only implicit bindings can shadow each other.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.0_20
  - Operating system: Ubuntu
I think this is a valid bug.  It looks like the same kind of problem as #3453.  (I'm not sure why !LowPriImplicits is in Josh's example, since it isn't used.)

As a simpler example:
```scala
object MyImplicits {
  implicit def str2int(x : String) = x.toInt
}
import MyImplicits._
object Foo {
  def str2int = null
  def test : Int = "5"
}
```

This compiles, although it should not.  The implicit str2int is not accessible without a prefix because the wildcard import is shadowed by the local definition.  If str2int is made implicit, scalac correctly generates an error.
related to #3453 --  `nonImplicitSynonymInScope` probably needs to be improved to consider imports
Another example where this isn't working. The `context.scope` checked by `nonImplicitSynonymInScope` doesn't contain the template member `x`.

```scala
object Test1 {
  object A { implicit val x: Int = 1 }
  import A.x
  def x: Int = 0
  implicitly[Int]
}
```

By contrast, this does shadow:

```scala
object Test2 {
  object A { implicit val x: Int = 1 }
  
  {
    import A.x
    def x: Int = 0
    implicitly[Int]
  }
}
```
Test cases for this bug should also exercise renamed imports -- examples in the test cases for #2405.
in general implicit method names do not matter, unless they are accidentally ambiguous
the error message generated by compiler if implicit is shadowed makes it really hard to understand what's going on
it just says that e.g. a method provided by conversion is not found, no clue about why conversion does not kick in
