Using actors with asynchronous operations can currently result in messy code when compared to using synchronous operations. This is because it is often necessary to nest the continuations for each reaction, even when the logic is basically linear.

eg
```scala
val x = adder !? Add(1, 2)
val y = adder !? Add(3, 4)
val z = adder !? Add(x.asInstanceOf[Int], y.asInstanceOf[Int])
println("Sum is: " + z)
```
vs
```scala
adder ! Add(1, 2)
react {
  case x => {
    adder ! Add(3, 4)
    react {
      case y => {
	adder ! Add(x.asInstanceOf[Int], y.asInstanceOf[Int])
	react {
	  case z => {
	    println("Sum is: " + z)
	  }
	}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

However, using Responders and for comprehensions can make a continuation-passing style much clearer. The following patch adds support for Responders to the Actor class.

 * Adds `%` as an asynchronous alternative to `?`.
 * Adds `!%` as an asynchronous alternative to `!?`.
 * Makes Futures into Responders, making it possible to asychronously wait for their value.

eg
```scala
Responder.run {
  for (
    x <- adder !% Add(1, 2);
    y <- adder !% Add(3, 4);
    z <- adder !% Add(x.asInstanceOf[Int], y.asInstanceOf[Int]);
    _ <- exec(println("Sum is: " + z))
  ) yield ()
}
```
Adding support for writing actors using `Responder`s has been discussed for a long time now. (See for example http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/1350/.)

In r14801 I committed initial support for that. It generalizes the proposals discussed in the mailing list thread referenced above by introducing the `async` method (not sure whether the name is ideal). This method can be used to make methods like `react` usable inside `Responder`s. I attach the source code for some examples that demonstrates the usage.

For convenience there is also a `reactor` factory method for creating `Responder`-based actors. It takes a `Responder` as argument.

An idea that I like is to make `Future`s into `Responder`s. Note that this makes the `!%` method that you propose obsolete: your above example can be written as follows:

```scala
val a = reactor {
  for {
    x <- adder !! Add(1, 2);
    y <- adder !! Add(3, 4);
    z <- adder !! Add(x.asInstanceOf[Int], y.asInstanceOf[Int]);
    if   exec(println("Sum is: " + z))
  } yield {}
}
```

I invite people to try out this extension, and give feedback on the mailing lists.

I close this ticket now.
