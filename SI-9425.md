When compiling a case class with a private constructor, calling the apply method causes an error (to do too aggressive inlining).

```scala
scala> :paste
case class Foo private (x: Int)
Foo.apply(x)

<console>:10: error: constructor Foo in class Foo cannot be accessed in object $iw
              Foo.apply(5)
                  ^
```

I'd expect this to work the same when they are compiled together or separate, for example:

```scala
scala> case class Foo private(x: int)
defined class Foo

scala> Foo(5)
res5: Foo = Foo(5)
```
