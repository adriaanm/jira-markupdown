Andreas: This error is the scalac internal equivalent of a `NullPointerException`. It is very likely that your issue is distinct.

Please open a new ticket. But we will need more data to reproduce it.

Firstly, run 'last' in SBT after the compilation crash to show me the full stack trace. That might be enough to see if this is an already-reported issue.

The problem was encountered in the file "PlateView.scala". Try to isolate to cut that file down step by step (replace method bodies by `???`), to find which method contains the problematic construct. Then try to make another file with the same construct compile with the same construct but without dependencies on the rest of your project.
