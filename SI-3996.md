{{LinkedListLike}}'s {{length}} implementation (with which {{size}} happens to be overridden) is recursive, but not tail-recursive. Naturally, this means a call to {{length}} can result in Stack Overflow.

In a brief research into {{length}} and {{size}} implementations I couldn't find any other suffering from this malady. So I propose the following implementation for it:

{code}
override def length: Int = {
  var len = 0
  var left = this
  while (!left.isEmpty) {
    len += 1
    left = left.next
  }
  len
}
{code}

Which happens to be an almost verbattim copy of... I think {{Stream}}, replacing {{tail}} with {{next}}. {{LinearSeqOptimized}} also has a very similar definition, but using {{these}} instead of {{left}} as the variable name, so I'm not sure why {{Stream}} is overridding it at all, except, perhaps, as an optimization opportunity missed.

Since {{tail}} is present all the way back in {{Seq}}, I don't see why the above implementation (but using {{tail}}) isn't made default at {{SeqLike}}, and let collections which can optimize it override that.

At any rate, {{LikedListLike}}'s implementation ought to be fixed.
It's worse than that.  Here is TraversableOnce:
{code}
def size: Int = {
  var result = 0	
  for (x <- self) result += 1
  result
}
{code}
Why is this not sufficient.  Does someone have evidence that some other way of writing this is faster if you have to traverse the collection regardless? Because otherwise we could just stop overriding it without a clear reason.
Well, I did see that at {{TraversableOnce}}, but it uses a closure, which the implementation using {{while}} and {{tail}} avoids. I guess both come pretty close with specialization and JVM optimizations, but...
