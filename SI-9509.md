Since it won't be made regular by loosening, it should be made regular by tightening to the spec, with deprecation and correct behavior in future.
{code}
scala> val x, _x, x_, x_y = 42
x: Int = 42
_x: Int = 42
x_: Int = 42
x_y: Int = 42

scala> s"$_x"  // error message could be more specific
<console>:1: error: error in interpolated string: identifier or block expected
s"$_x"
   ^

scala> s"$x_"  // should be "42_"
res0: String = 42

scala> s"$x_y"  // "42_y"
res1: String = 42

The summer SLIP meeting dealt with backticked idents ([summery summary|http://scala-lang.org/blog/2015/07/26/sip-slip-summary-july-2015.html]) and Martin bemoaned underscores in the idents (that people wanted them when they weren't supposed to be there, then that they'd leaked into the implementation, where naughty people might be tempted to exploit them).

Since leading underscore is disallowed, it's clear that embedded underscore must also be disallowed, as specified by the SIP.

The implementation for loosening (interpolated idents are just idents, basta) was [here|https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4663].

Since liberals have taken over Canada, this PR is a reactionary attempt to take back some ground. Close the borders. Batten down the hatches. All those Canadiens will try to get in now. Martin was so right. It starts with underscores, but ends in anarchy.
The relevant section of the [YouTube video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndkT5qHZHI0] begins at 18:55, with Martin's remark about underscores in particular at 19:19 ("put underscores in there, or whatever"). It seems like a passing remark to me, not like an edict that settles everything.

I see in your PR that what the existing code uses is `java.lang.Character.isUnicodeIdentifierPart` ([Javadoc|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#isUnicodeIdentifierPart(char)]).

There is a well established tradition, dating back to C if not longer, of considering underscore to be a sort of honorary alphanumeric character (and isUnicodeIdentifierPart follows this tradition, which is why the existing implementation accepts underscores). In this vein, SLS 1.1 has "First, an identifier can start with a letter which can be followed by an arbitrary sequence of letters and digits. This may be followed by underscore ‘_‘ characters and another string composed of either letters and digits or of operator characters".

So I think you can still argue it's better to bring the SIP-11 wording ("identifier consisting only of alphanumeric characters") in line with the implementation or with SLS 1.1. Especially since bringing the implementation in line with the existing SIP-11 wording would break existing code and (IMO) violate long-standing expectations and traditions about allowing _ in the middle of identifiers.

We'll discuss at the Scala team meeting on Monday.

We discussed this with Martin just now and he agreed unhesitatingly that underscores should be allowed, just like in SLS 1.1. (We didn't delve into why he seemed to say otherwise in the SLIP video.)

So, we should just change what the string interpolation SIP says about it, at http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/string-interpolation.html.

But, I see that SIP-11 is actually a Google Docs document owned by Martin, so there's no way to change it via pull request. (http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/string-interpolation.html exists, but it's less technical and doesn't have wording covering the issue.)

In some theoretical future, the SIP would just be a historical document that doesn't matter anymore because it was merged into the spec, but that hasn't been happening, so I guess I'll write Martin and ask for edit rights.

[~apm] Any questions?
Does that mean the example should work? You needn't reply here; just so the document clarifies it.

{code}
scala> val _x = 5
_x: Int = 5

scala> s"$_x"
<console>:1: error: error in interpolated string: identifier or block expected
s"$_x"
   ^

scala> q"def f = 42" match { case q"def f = $_" => }

scala> q"def fx = 42" match { case q"def $_x = $_" => }
<console>:17: error: Don't know how to extract here
       q"def fx = 42" match { case q"def $_x = $_" => }
                                          ^
