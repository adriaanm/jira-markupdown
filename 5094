Yup:
{code}
object A {
  object B {
    class C
  }
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val c = Class.forName(classOf[A.B.C].getName)
    println(c)
  }
}
{code}

prints
{code}
class A$B$C
{code}

I would have suggested that before if I understood your reasoning. That's exactly why we ask for more information here and there ;-)
