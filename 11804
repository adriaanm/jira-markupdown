I got a really long list of lines similar to the ones below when reproducing:
```scala
warning: Class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseCommonTestingUtility not found - continuing with a stub.
warning: Class org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.compress.Compression not found - continuing with a stub.
warning: Class org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration not found - continuing with a stub.
...
```

This means there are classes missing from the classpath. 

Looking a the pom.xml for hbase-server, there is a dependency there on the test jar of hbase-common, but I don't see it in sbt in dependencyClasspath, so there is definitely something wrong on sbt's side. You should probably raise an issue there: https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues
