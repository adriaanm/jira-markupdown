Actually it's looking like option SI-3, the failing exit code being lost due to changes I made to the bash script in the service of not installing a shutdown hook for jline to restore terminal settings so that sbt wouldn't have a massive classloader leak due to jline's shutdown hook hanging onto everything.

OH WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE.
