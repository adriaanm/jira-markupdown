After installation of scala-2.12.0.msi following problem occurs

{code:bash}
c:\Program Files (x86)\scala\bin>scala
"\scala\bin\scala.bat)" kann syntaktisch an dieser Stelle nicht verarbeitet werden.
{code}

Fix line 160 and 161 with quotes like

  for %%i in ("%~sf0") do set _BIN_DIR=%_BIN_DIR%%%~dpsi
  set _SCALA_HOME=%"_BIN_DIR"%..

I've managed to reproduce this by disabling 8.3 file name creation and then installing in a new directory (with spaces in the directory name):

I don't think it's a regression, most users manage to work around it I guess.
