```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.RC4 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_26).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> { val 1 = 2 }
scala.MatchError: 2 (of class java.lang.Integer)

scala> val 1 = 2

```

the latter should be an error too

#4939 was closed as wontfix, but this is just the REPL piece of it, which really is a bug
Another example from #5855:

```scala
scala> val List(1) = List(1)
<console>:5: error: value x$1 is not a member of object $iw
  lazy val $result = `x$1`
```
Scala 2.11.1:

```scala
scala> val 1 = 2
scala.MatchError: 2 (of class java.lang.Integer)
  ... 32 elided
```

```scala
scala> val List(1) = List(1)

scala> 
```

Is there anything else expected here?

Otherwise, I'd write a PR which adds tests and close this issue.
