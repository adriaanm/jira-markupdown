I just ran into this bug with code that looks like this:

{code}
class Foo extends DelayedInit {
  def delayedInit (newBody: => Unit) {
    body = () => newBody
  }

  def foo = "FOO"

  var body: () => Unit = _
}

class Bar extends Foo {
  def bar = foo

  private class Baz extends Foo {
    bar
  }
}
{code}

This is on version 2.10.0-20121205-235900-18481cef9b.
