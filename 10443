When it works, we see this tree as found by `interactive.Global#signalDone`
```scala
scala.this.Predef.implicitly[Foo[A]](evidence$7).foo
```

When it fails, we see:
```scala
implicitly[Foo[A]].foo(x$7)
```

Find the "x$7", and we'll be close the the culprit. Hopefully this will just entail a refinement of the fix for scala/bug#7558.
