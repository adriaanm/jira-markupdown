When it works, we see this tree as found by `interactive.Global#signalDone`

{code}
scala.this.Predef.implicitly[Foo[A]](evidence$7).foo
{code}

When it fails, we see:

{code}
implicitly[Foo[A]].foo(x$7)
{code}

Find the "x$7", and we'll be close the the culprit. Hopefully this will just entail a refinement of the fix for SI-7558.
