I recently did some refactoring on my Scala code and later realized that
I had a private method that was no longer used.

It would be great if the Scala compiler could warn about these to indicate
programming errors.

For example, this should generate a warning since do_nothing is not
used.
```scala
class Test {
  private def do_nothing = 10
}
```

Currently, we can use findbugs to find these, but having the compiler
do them would be much nicer.
