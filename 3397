even minimaler...:

{code}
class UnApp[P] {
  def unapply(a: P): Option[P] = Some(a)
}

object Test extends Application {
  val b: UnApp[_] = new UnApp[String]
  val b(foo) = "foo" 
}
{code}

I'm not sure, but I assume this is not meant to compile.

Changing the call to `freshArgType` to read `freshArgType(unappType skolemizeExistential(context.owner, context.tree))`
avoids the crash and reports an error that seems correct...
