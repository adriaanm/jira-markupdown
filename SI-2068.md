{code}
trait A[B[X, Y <: X, Z <: Y]]

trait D[X, Y, Z <: X]
trait E[X >: Y, Y, Z]

type D1[X, Y <: X, Z <: Y] = D[X, Y, Z]
type E1[X, Y <: X, Z <: Y] = E[X, Y, Z]
{code}

Given these definitions, type applications A[D] and A[E] are rejected. This can be worked around as A[D1] and A[E1]. Note that D1 and E1 are actually synonyms for D and E. So, it would be nice if the compiler also accepted A[D] and A[E] without explicit 'kind casts'.
