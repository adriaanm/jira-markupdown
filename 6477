Sorry.  The bug database sucks beyond all comprehension.  Since anyone can set any priority to a ticket, the existing ~1000 tickets have a mix of priorities I have set and arbitrary priorities chosen by anyone.  I need some way to communicate priorities so I went around the database lowering the priority of all the ones which are higher than the default where I did not personally raise it.

About this bug, from one standpoint it's easy to agree, and from another, no scaladoc bug is going to compete for the very small space I have in which to place higher priority bugs.
