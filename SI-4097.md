<console>:6: error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: Ordering[Seq[Int]]
       implicitly[Ordering[Seq[Int]]]

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Would be nice to get an Ordering for lexicographic comparison.

There isn't a problem per se with giving it an Ordering.  Although the trac ticket says "List" and the example says "Seq".  The problem is only in how deftly the request illustrates the cost of Ordering not being contravariant.

So I can give one to Seq, and the whole implementation is a glossed over identity function using the existing ordering on Iterables.
```scala
implicit def Seq[T: Ordering] : Ordering[Seq[T]] =
  Ordering[Iterable[T]] on ((xs: Seq[T]) => xs)
```
And then I can give one to List, and there's captain identity again.
```scala
implicit def List[T: Ordering] : Ordering[List[T]] =
  Ordering[Iterable[T]] on ((xs: List[T]) => xs)
```
So I can do it, but the implementation might appear to the casual viewer as a cry for help.
Hey, interesting.  Last time I tried something like this (it was a while ago) the type system would not cooperate.  But now this works, at least in limited testing.
```scala
implicit def IterableSubclass[CC[X] <: Iterable[X], T: Ordering] : Ordering[CC[T]] = {
  new Ordering[CC[T]] {
    val ord = implicitly[Ordering[T]]
    def compare(x: CC[T], y: CC[T]): Int = {
      val xe = x.iterator
      val ye = y.iterator

      while (xe.hasNext && ye.hasNext) {
        val res = ord.compare(xe.next, ye.next)
        if (res != 0) return res
      }

      Ordering.Boolean.compare(xe.hasNext, ye.hasNext)
    }
  }
}  
```
```scala
scala> List(List(1,2,5),List(1,2,10),List(1,2),List(3,1,249,4)).sorted
res0: List[List[Int]] = List(List(1, 2), List(1, 2, 5), List(1, 2, 10), List(3, 1, 249, 4))

scala> Seq(Seq(1, 2, 5), Seq(5, 4, 3), Seq( 1, 2)).sorted
res1: Seq[Seq[Int]] = List(List(1, 2), List(1, 2, 5), List(5, 4, 3))  
```
Implemented approximately as described in r23810.
There are unfortunate consequences lurking here. Subclassing, universal equality and type classes really don't like to be in the same room as each other.

```scala
scala> implicitly[Equiv[Set[Int]]].equiv(Set(1, 2), Set(2, 1))
res0: Boolean = false
```

The workaround [https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/scalaz/Equal.scala#L171 isn't pretty].

Maybe you can restrict this to `CC[X]<:Seq[X]` to avoid some more obvious problems; and/or document around this.
The original implementation made me too nervous because it created divergent implicit expansions where there were none before, so you have to import it now: import Ordering.Implicits._.

The general issues of Ordering's variance, and the obstacle that implicit search for contravariant types prefers (or would if Ordering were contravariant) "Ordering[Any]" to "Ordering[SpecificThing]" remain unresolved.
