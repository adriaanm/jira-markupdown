See attachment for two instances of the problem, and some workarounds.

Also note the original discussion of this:

And for what it's worth, like #2081 this was introduced in r17680.

I tried, but they don't seem to have evaporated for me.  Can you verify that you can compile it? Here's what I get with recent trunk:
```scala
files/pos/bug2303.scala:8: error: not found: type $$anon
  implicit val ListFunctor = new Functor[List] {
                             ^
files/pos/bug2303.scala:11: error: not found: type $$anon
  implicit val ListFunctorFMapExplicitReturnType = new Functor[List] {
                                                   ^
```
I am unable to reproduce this issue in 2.8.0.r22276.

Compiling the file as follows finishes without errors:

```scala
build/quick/bin/scalac -d sandbox/classes/ sandbox/test.scala
```

If someone feels the issue has been closed wrongly, please let me know.
