```scala
Int.box(1)
```


Leads to 

```scala
scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing

	at scala.Predef$.$qmark$qmark$qmark(Predef.scala:284)
	at scala.Int$.box(Int.scala:455)
```
I cannot reproduce this issue:

```
$ cat A.scala
object Test{
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(Int.box(1))
  }
}
$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.12.0-RC1 -- Copyright 2002-2016, LAMP/EPFL
$ scalac A.scala && scala Test
1
```

Could you post the exact steps that you followed?
You know what, works perfectly with Scala.
I overlooked that my problem occurs in groovy when the scala-Int is used there.

e.g. MainGroovy.groovy

```java
class MainGroovy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        println scala.Int.box(1)
    }
}
```

has the problem.

Here a running project reproducing the issue:
https://github.com/guenhter/sandbox/tree/master/scala-issue-SI-9942

BTW:
Works perfectly well with scala 2.11.x
see https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5072 and #6710

scala.Int is a fiction of the Scala compiler; you shouldn't try to use it from other languages such as Java or Groovy.
