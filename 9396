@retronym â€“ I don't think it is scala/bug#7436, because that says it's fixed in Scala 2.10.3-RC1. I am just running my example with Scala 2.10.3-RC1 and it still crashes. This affects some core libraries I am using (https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaOSC and https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider). It is a little sad that they only work properly with 2.10.0. Any chance of getting this fixed in the 2.10 series?
