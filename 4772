Treating Array[Object] as an erasure of Array[AnyVal] is a bug, because casting primitive arrays to Object[] causes ClassCastException in Java. Also there is no boxing taking place.

I understand that we had our disagreements on the mailing list. If my bug report is too personal for you too handle I suggest you step back and let someone else handle it.
