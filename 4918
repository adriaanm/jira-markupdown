I just sent a pull request containing exactly the example given by Lukas: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2677

It fails with 2.10.1 and works with 2.10.2 and current master. This is all I checked, so I didn't really verify that SI-3936 is a duplicate of SI-7232. However, I think it's safe to close SI-3936.
