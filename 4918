I just sent a pull request containing exactly the example given by Lukas: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2677

It fails with 2.10.1 and works with 2.10.2 and current master. This is all I checked, so I didn't really verify that scala/bug#3936 is a duplicate of scala/bug#7232. However, I think it's safe to close scala/bug#3936.
