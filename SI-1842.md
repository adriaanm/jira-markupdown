this is on the trunk at r17416:
{code}
  ~/nl/new> cat p/J.java 
package p ;
class J { boolean b ; }
  ~/nl/new> cat p/S.scala
package p
object S { (new J).b }
  ~/nl/new> ~/scala.trunk/dists/latest/bin/scalac -version 
Scala compiler version 2.8.0.r17416-b20090331140629 -- Copyright 2002-2009, LAMP/EPFL
  ~/nl/new> ~/scala.trunk/dists/latest/bin/scalac p/S.scala p/J.java 
p/S.scala:2: error: variable b cannot be accessed in p.J
object S { (new J).b }
                   ^
one error found
{code}

but it works if you use javac first:
{code}
  ~/nl/new> javac p/J.java
  ~/nl/new> ~/scala.trunk/dists/latest/bin/scalac p/S.scala         
  ~/nl/new> 
{code}


This was an artifact of my attempts to get SI-1240 working.  I have surrendered, SI-1240 is reopened but this one works.
