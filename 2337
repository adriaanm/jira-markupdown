Please read how to do markup.  Use triple curly braces to bookend code.

Here is my comment in MarkupParsers which may serve to explain how this bug still exists after I already fixed it.  I guess cutting and pasting huge swaths of code might cause a maintenance issue.  Alert the media.
```scala
// XXX/Note: many/most of the functions in here are almost direct cut and pastes
// from another file - scala.xml.parsing.MarkupParser, it looks like.
// (It was like that when I got here.) They used to be commented "[Duplicate]" but
// since approximately all of them were, I snipped it as noise.  As far as I can
// tell this wasn't for any particularly good reason, but slightly different
// compiler and library parser interfaces meant it would take some setup.
//
// I rewrote most of these, but not as yet the library versions: so if you are
// tempted to touch any of these, please be aware of that situation and try not
// to let it get any worse.  -- paulp
```
