it appears to me from a quick glance at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/set_intersection/ that the STL's {{set_intersection}} method implements set intersection on sorted ranges. Scala's intersection method, on the other hand, implements multiset intersection and doesn't require sorted input. So you shouldn't expect the same answer.
