given our common java backgrounds, we are used to not using qualified types in links. So we often do
```scala
/** blah blah [[MyClass]] */
```

sometimes we forget we have to fully qualify classes; sometimes we make a typo. But scaladoc silently ignores badly named link types.

We should generate a warning instead - so we can catch typos and improve the linking in our documentation
