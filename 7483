Fix for implicit class / value class collision.

New this week, on SCALA.

Implicit class: "Spin me up an implicit method with my name."
   Value class: "I need a companion object, pronto."
      Narrator: "All was well with this arrangement... UNTIL."

What happens when these two wacky SIPs get together in the very
same class? You'll laugh until, eventually, you cry! Weeknights
at 9:30pm, only on SCALA.

Closes SI-5667.
