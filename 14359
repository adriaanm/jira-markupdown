According to the Scala spec, :// is not one of the explicitly disallowed operators.  Example usage:

{code}
val :// = "testing"
{code}

Unfortunately, the parser interprets this as {{val :}} followed by a comment.  The lexer should be made aware of the associated parse context (scannerless) to allow this sort of thing.  At the very least, the spec should be clarified.
