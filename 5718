I realize that.  I am sure.

It is, both of which are synonymous with not giving a -g option.  I'm not saying this is how it should be, but this is how it is and always has been.  Compile something with no options, any version of scala, and in javap you will see a LocalVariableTable, and that's what "vars" is.
