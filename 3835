(In r21597) Removed a bunch of -Y warning options.  I intend to someday bring them
back in the form of a compiler plugin.  Also promoted -Yfatal-warnings
to -Xfatal-warnings: this is key to writing tests which involve
warnings and should be at least semi-supported.  Closes scala/bug#3300, no review.
