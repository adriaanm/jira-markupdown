Enum.java
```scala
public enum Enum {
  VALUE;
}
```

Ann.java
```scala
public @interface Ann {
  Enum value();
}
```

Use.scala
```scala
class Use {
  @Ann(Enum.VALUE)
  def foo {}
}
```

Compiling them together with scalac gives:
```scala
lamppc11:sandbox luc$$ ../build/pack/bin/scalac Enum.java Ann.java Use.scala 
Use.scala:2: error: annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: Enum.VALUE
  @Ann(Enum.VALUE)
            ^
one error found
```

Compiling java first, then scala works.

The same issue arises for static constants in Java source files.

https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/2764#comment:12
I can reproduce the problem with the following minimized example,

Enum.java
```scala
public enum Enum {
  VALUE;
}
```

Ann.java
```scala
public @interface Ann {
  Enum value();
}
```

Use.scala
```scala
class Use {
  @Ann(Enum.VALUE)
  def foo {}
}
```

And in this case an error is reported by command line scalac,

```scala
src/bug2764/Use.scala:4: error: annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: Enum.VALUE
  @Ann(Enum.VALUE)
            ^
one error found
```

So it looks like the Eclipse vs. command-line build issue might be a red-herring.

In both cases scalac is seeing a UniqueConstantType in a context where it's expecting to see a Literal (in Typer.typedAnnotation).
The problem is that java enum values don't have a constant type when being parsed from java source (it works when compiling against the compiled java files). Not sure where to fix this, probably some special case in the typer.

The classfile parser does it:
```scala
sym.setInfo(if ((jflags & JAVA_ACC_ENUM) == 0) info else mkConstantType(Constant(sym)))
```
ok... after updating my Eclipse Scala IDE to the latest snapshot tonight it stopped working on "def"
@rytz: my observation is that the error only shows up in the eclipse code(text) editor sidebar and not(!) in the "Markers" view. Further it gets already displayed during editing and not after saving the resource. I don't know too much about the eclipse "code validation while editing" internals but it seems to me that the error marker is generated before compiling the resource.
...and the compiled code runs as expected.
???
But we are talking about `javax.servlet.DispatcherType.REQUEST`– a Java EE annotation. None of them should compile that enum. They should just use the one from `javaee-api-6.0.jar`

And let me check:

```scala
SET CLASSPATH=%[CLASSPATH];%[Repository]\javax\javaee-api\6.0\javaee-api-6.0.jar
```

Yep it is on the classpath as well.

Replying to [comment:31 rytz]:
That other issue is now #4607
Just a heads up for everybody using sbt: you can specify the compile order like so:

```scala
class MyProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) {
  override def compileOrder = CompileOrder.JavaThenScala
}
```
FWIW: The following works, using a scala object:

```scala
object F {
	final val a = ""
}

class A {
	@MyAnnotation(name = F.a)
	var name = "fish"
}
```

So having **final val** works
However, this doesn't:
```scala
object F {
	final val a: String = ""
}

class A {
	@MyAnnotation(name = F.a)
	var name = "fish"
}
```

results in:
```scala
error: annotation argument needs to be a constant; found: F.A
@MyAnnotation(name = F.a)
```

So the type-annotation :String breaks the whole thing, very strange...
Yes, reading the spec (which I admit I hadn't), it clearly states "The final modifier must be present and no type annotation may be given".

But, to the average developer:
```scala
val a = "hi"
```
and
```scala
val a: String = "hi"
```
are the same thing, everything else is unexpected and comes as a surprise.
This happens in Maven run from the command line. The problem appears to be the Scala compiler not properly interpreting Java enums as constants in mixed source code (scalac **.scala **.java).
Christ, there's no working around it either, eh? Either turn your compilation model upside down or hardcode literals. I don't (yet) understand the internals of why this is hard to resolve, but three years and no working annotations... **sigh**
It's possible that it's not that hard to resolve, but there aren't that many people who write actual code, and the people who do have hundreds (or thousands) of issues competing for their attention.
This bug is very annoing, so I watch the thread and hope for fix.
I used annotations for AOP(aspectj) in one of my scala projects for android. 
Here is workaround that working for me. Maybe, it will help you.

- declare annotation Cacheable in Java
https://github.com/ezh/android-DigiLib/blob/master/src/main/java/org/digimead/digi/ctrl/lib/aop/Cacheable.java

There is no URL because this part of code is not public.

- use annotation Cacheable in Scala
@Cacheable(namespace = Cache.web, examination = true)
protected def httpGetFunc[T](force: Boolean, url: String)(implicit m: scala.reflect.Manifest[T]): Option[T] = try {

Cache.web as simple as

object Cache {
  // pregenerated random
  final val web = 123456
  final val marketItem = 654321
  object Period {
    final val ever = -1
    final val default = 0
  }
}

King Regards
Great, thanks for the fix! For the second part of the ticket, there's a separate issue now (#5791).
