This bug is a consequence of scalac reusing the Scala typechecker to analyze Java source files, given the difference binding precedence rules:

Java Spec:
```
A single-type-import declaration d in a compilation unit c of package p that imports
a type named n shadows, throughout c, the declarations of:
• any top level type named n declared in another compilation unit of p
• any type named n imported by a type-import-on-demand declaration in c
• any type named n imported by a static-import-on-demand declaration in c
```

Scala Spec:
```
Bindings of different kinds have a precedence deﬁned on them:
1. Deﬁnitions and declarations that are local, inherited, or made available by a
package clause in the same compilation unit where the deﬁnition occurs have
highest precedence.
2. Explicit imports have next highest precedence.
```
