This seems incredibly wasteful and slow to me. Here's the top part of a stack trace from hprof:

```scala
java.lang.reflect.Array.set(Array.java:Unknown line)
	scala.collection.IndexedSeqLike$$class.copyToArray(IndexedSeqLike.scala:169)
	scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.copyToArray(ArrayBuffer.scala:28)
	scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.$$plus$$plus$$eq(ArrayBuffer.scala:75)
	scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.$$plus$$plus$$eq(ArrayBuffer.scala:28)
	scala.collection.TraversableLike$$class.$$plus$$plus(TraversableLike.scala:132)
	scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.$$plus$$plus(ArrayBuffer.scala:28)

```

My suggestion would be to override copyToArray in ArrayBuffer . I can try to do the patch if people want. I'd like a thumbs up or thumbs down on whether people agree this is worthwhile.
This turns out to be a small problem in ResizableArray where it overrides the two parameter copyToArray, but not the three parameter version. Since the default implementation of the two param (in SeqLike) calls the three param, I just made ResizableArray override the three-parameter one.

I feel like there's an argument to be made that the two parameter version should be made final 1) to prevent these kinds of mistakes in the future and 2) to make HotSpot more likely to inline it.

All tests still pass (except one I'm getting out of heap errors on, but that's with and without this patch...)
