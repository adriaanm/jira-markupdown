It's caught, so the following statements in try:

{code}
      while (true) {
          scheduler.waitForMoreWork()
          pollForWork()
          while (outOfDate) {
            try {
              backgroundCompile()
              outOfDate = false
            } catch {
              case ex: FreshRunReq =>
            }
          }
        }
{code}

won't be interrupted, it's still there and running, although it's named "ShutdownReq", there's no difference from throwing any other Exceptions.
