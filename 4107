The reason I only warn rather than fixing it at the signature generation point is that detecting it depends on sun internal classes and I don't want to add one more mystery by having it work some places and not others.  It would not be rocket science to write our own signature parser, but it's not something I have time for at the moment (even though I've already done it, more than once in fact...) if anyone wants to bring up to date some of the parsers in here, it'd be so appreciated.

Look how beautiful:

This one is especially compelling given that that's all the necessary logic:
