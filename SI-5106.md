I think this deserves more than an "unchecked" warning:

{code}
scala> def f {
     | val (n, l): (String, Int) = (4, "");
     | }
warning: there were 2 unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
f: Unit

scala> f
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String
[...]
{code}

This is specially surprising because this other very similar case (created from SI-140, which I initially thought was the same bug) works as I expected:

{code}
scala> def g {
     | val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
     | }
<console>:8: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : String
 required: Int
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
               ^
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String
 required: Int
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
             ^
<console>:8: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : Int
 required: String
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
                          ^
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int
 required: String
       val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
{code}

seems fixed in master:

{code}
scala> val (n, l): (String, Int) = (4, "")
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(4)
 required: String
       val (n, l): (String, Int) = (4, "")
                                    ^
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("")
 required: Int
       val (n, l): (String, Int) = (4, "")
                                       ^

scala>  val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
<console>:7: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : String
 required: Int
        val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
                ^
<console>:7: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : Int
 required: String
        val (n: String, l: Int) = (4, "");
{code}
