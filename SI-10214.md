I think each of the following 2 lines contain a bug; a Template cannot become the owner of other symbols, isn't it?
* https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.1/src/reflect/scala/reflect/internal/Trees.scala#L1236;

This issue may lead compiler crashes when compiler plugins using Traverser class are enabled since it breaks owner chains.

I made a patch only for Traverser: https://github.com/hiroshi-cl/scala/commit/b219db7a689a33844606788bba12ed902464ef9c, but I failed to make for Transformer.
This fixing breaks existing compiler phases and a lot of test cases in partest fail.
A template does have a symbol, which is called the "local dummy", and it is used as the owner for blocks inside the template body.

The symbol is created in typedTemplate:
{code}
      if (templ.symbol == NoSymbol)
        templ setSymbol clazz.newLocalDummy(templ.pos)
{code}
Thank you for your response. I have a question: is the following code correct?
{quote}
      case Template(parents, self, body) =>
        traverseParents(parents)
        traverseSelfType(self)
        traverseStats(body, if(templ.symbol == NoSymbol) currentOwner else tree.symbol
{quote}
