Note to self: also, we need to in general enforce that a protected static is being accessed from a class which extends the java class containing the static.  Right now it will let you access from an unrelated class, and then the jvm will fail.  The complication is that in the scala model, the static method being accessed is in an object and therefore is never in anyone's superclass.
