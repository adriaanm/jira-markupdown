This is a rather tricky problem to get out of for fatal-errors, because it seems non-trivial to independently update scaladoc options in sbt.

(I can't try this out for 2.12.1 yet because we're blocked on scala-refactoring releasing a version we can use in ensime)
I think folks routinely specify scaladoc options for similar use cases, tho' the idiom is not on my fingertips.

The idiom is commented [on the PR](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5535)
I amended the title of the other ticket, and it does help the search result order a bit. :)
