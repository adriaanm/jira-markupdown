=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
scala> Set(1, 2, 3).view.map(_ => 1)
res7: scala.collection.IterableView[Int,Iterable[_]] = IterableViewM(...)

scala> res7.foreach(println _)
1
1
1
{code} 

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The result of the call to map should contain no duplicates, in this example one element.

=== What do you see instead? ===

The result contains duplicates and is the same length as the original set.
