The problem I see is the interaction with many other things. The `a' might be a pattern -- should the implicit then apply to all its variables? Then, the translation of generators in for expressions is quite involved. We'd have to speicfy how implicits are taken into account. This exceeds the design work usually associated with a ticket fix.  I close the ticket but would welcome a SID that contains spec language to regulate all these things.
