This compiles and works in 2.11.8, does not compile in 2.12.
{code}
trait Foo extends Any {
  val self: String
}
final class Bar(val self: String) extends AnyVal with Foo
{code}
Bar is included only to demonstrate that a universal trait with an abstract val is perfectly useful.

In 2.12 it fails with "error: field definition is not allowed in universal trait extending from class Any"
