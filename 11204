Yeah, these two issues do look similar.
But I think they're a bit different in the sense that, in SI-8697, it's two objects.
but In this issue, it turns out to be the trait and its companion object.

I kind of get the impression that the trait should be defined before its companion object, at least in usual scala code style.
But if this issue exists, it violates this code style.

Moreover, in this issue and in SI-8697, the implicit can not be found even after it has been imported into the scope.
This is kind of a bummer.
