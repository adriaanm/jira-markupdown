The following code was extracted from the 3rd assignment on the Coursera Reactive class.
```scala
package object nodescala { 
  trait Subscription

  object Subscription {
    def apply() = new Subscription {}
  }
}
```

If you open the above file in the Scala IDE for Eclipse and type a whitespace, the presentation compiler will report the following error:

> illegal cyclic reference involving package nodescala

While no issue is reported by the build compiler.

This is a regression wrt 2.10.3, and I hope we can consider it a blocker for 2.10.4-RC1.

My hope is that it should be relatively easy to create a presentation compiler test that demonstrates the issue. In fact, it should be enough to fully typecheck the source and check if any problem is reported.
