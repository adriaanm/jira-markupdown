It seems that scaladoc does not include the functions, values and types defined in a package object into the index.
I was looking for {{sqrt}} in the index, but it is not listed there. So is neither the value {{Pi}} (math), the type {{suspendable}} (util.continuations) or the method {{exit}} (sys).
Thanks for reporting Dominik! It's the same problem in SI-5558, but I thought Manohar fixed it. Will check again with him.
sorry, haven't looked for already registered bug reports.
