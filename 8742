Thanks for response. Actually, I think you need several methods. {{parse}} should be a method that does not do any wrapping and then {{parseDe}} for parsing src in definition position (as {{parse}} does at the moment) and then {{parseExpr}} to parse expressions.

This is not a blocker for me. I just noticed this problem while playing with reflection.
