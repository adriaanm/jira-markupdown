Now that #5805 has been fixed it's possible to bootstrap with GenASM emitting 1.6 classfiles. Perhaps the time has come for a dedicated (nightly) build to test that functionality. 

The following minimum changes in build.xml do the trick, and also make sure the new JVM verifier is used:

```
  <property name="scalac.args" value="-target:jvm-1.6"/>

  <property name="env.ANT_OPTS" value="-Xms1536M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:MaxPermSize=192M -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:-FailOverToOldVerifier -XX:+UseSplitVerifier -Xverify:all" />
```

The `-Xverify:all` above also serves as early warning about invalid bytecode that might have escaped testing (whether GenASM's fault or not).

It's also conceivable to have a (nightly?) build with -target:jvm-1.5-asm

TODO for @magarciaEPFL: GenASM can run faster under `-target:jvm-1.5-asm` by skipping the update of `reverseJavaName` (whose contents are needed only for 1.6 and up).


And the `javac.args` can also target 1.6
@lrytz, your comments are welcome!
Working on a patch for javac.target options.   Not as easy as you would hope....

Also, I kinda think perhaps scalac.args for JVM target should only be for scalac.args.quickonly, so we don't run into STARR vs. locker feature issues (those **are** my favorite).

I should have something by the end of the week.
An idea that might prove useful:

- Use Migration Manager to keep GenASM and GenJVM mutually honest ( by comparing the output of `-target:jvm-1.5-asm` and `-target:jvm-1.5` ). 
- Actually, for API compatibility purposes, 1.6 classfiles can also be compared with 1.5 classfiles.
- Any other JAR diffing tool should also do, especially if available as ANT task

A [discussion ](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/sb4uiyllKmo/discussion) was started at scala-internals to gather feedback on this approach.

This build would be a good place to test stability. As far as GenASM is concerned the following will do:

```
ant quick.clean -Dscalac.args.quickonly="-target:jvm-1.5-asm" test.stability

ant quick.clean -Dscalac.args.quickonly="-target:jvm-1.6"     test.stability
```



https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/841 activates GenASM as default backend, 
and also adds "jvm-1.6" and "jvm-1.7" as `PermissibleValue` in 
```
src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/Scalac.scala 
```

Now that GenASM is the default backend for 1.6 classfiles (see below)  this ticket should be repurposed to 1.7 classfiles.
