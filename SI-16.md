== Code ==

```scala
object Foo {
   // this is overly verbose
   def getInt(s : String) = try {
     s.toInt
   } catch {
     case e : NumberFormatException => 0
   }

   // I'd much rather write this
   def getInt2(s : String) = s.toInt(0)
}
```

== What happened ==

n/a

== What expected ==

To be able to optionally provide a default value for string-to-primitive conversion methods, much like Option.get.
Yes, your idea of making a wrapper sounds like the right thing to do. How about `optional'? It probably could do into Predef. Or do you have a better idea?

I'm torn, as I think there's already too much in Predef, which I would rather see broken down.  This issue is well intertwined with (at least) my hopes for a) a much easier import/export mechanism b) a generalized exception handling mechanism.  So it's hard to say whether I have a better idea, it depends a bit on the appropriate level of ambition.

I would definitely prefer to call it "opt" though, since making this lightweight is key.

Just thinking out loud now, because what better place than closed trac ticket #16 could there be for me to flesh out my ideas, but:

  def opt[T](f: => T)(implicit pf: PartialFunction[Either[Throwable,T]] => Boolean): Option[T] = ...

The gist being that somehow a function must be supplied which partitions both return values and exceptions into Some, None, or neither (that last being exceptions which you did not opt to catch, which will simply fly right on through.)

Now very nice wrappers can be written.  This approach also generalizes the oft-rewritten

  def onull[T](x: T): Option[T] = if (x == null) None else Some(x)

...but now that could be composed with other criteria or exceptions.
