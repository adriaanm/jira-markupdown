I'm seeing this problem with scala 2.7.5. 

This is also impacting the ability to override java methods that use varargs. The overriden methods are never invoked, even though the code compiles without errors.

Running the testcase attached above produces:
{code}
JavaPrinter: one two three 
JavaPrinter: one two three 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AbstractMethodError
at Main.doYourThing(Main.java:12)
at Main.main(Main.java:8)
{code}
Expected result:
{code}
JavaPrinter: one two three 
InheritingPrinter extends JavaPrinter: one two three 
ScalaPrinter: one two three 
{code}
