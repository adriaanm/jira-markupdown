For alias and abstract types this it is now possible to annotate the doc comment with {{@documentable}} (or {{@template}}) to get a page for the type and list it on the right:

{code}
/** ...
 *  @template
 */
type Set[A]     = immutable.Set[A]
{code}

I will leave this bug open so we decide if we really want to have that for java classes, for which we don't have any doc comments. (String is a good example, you'll get a page with all of String's methods, but none of them has comments, as the class is Java-defined and the source code is not recompiled)
