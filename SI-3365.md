scala.actors.remote.RemoteActor.select(...) returns an instance of remote.Proxy as an AbstractActor.

While remote.Proxy.!! return Futures, AbstractActor.!! only returns () => P. Since remote.Proxy is private[remote], you can't cast the result of RemoteActor.select to it, either.

Only workaround I can think of: Do asInstanceOf[Future[T]] on the return values of AbstractActor.!! (really ugly)

Shouldn't the !! methods of AbstractActor return Futures, like Actor and remote.Proxy do, since it is their only common superclass?
