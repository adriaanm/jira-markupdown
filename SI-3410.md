It would be very handy if Future.map and Future.flatMap returned a Future, instead of returning only a Responder.

Since Responders lacks Future's apply() methods and can't be used with Futures.awaitAll (resp. awaitEither), mapping a future currently limits it's further use to CPS programming.

Having the Future monad transform to itself instead of a weaker superclass would also be more elegant:

```scala
def f(fi: Future[Int], fj: Future[Int]) : Future[Int] = for (
  i <- fi;
  j <- fy
) yield {
  i + j
}

println( f(a !! (x, ...), b !! (y, ...)) () )
```


Is this doable?
Another possibility would be to add a simple method `future(resp: Responder)` to scala.actors.Futures to convert a Responder into a Future:

```scala
object Futures {
  ...

  def future[T](resp: Responder[T]): Future[T] = {
    val c = new Channel[T](Actor.self(DaemonScheduler))
    val a = new FutureActor[T](fv => resp.respond {rv => fv.set(rv)}, c)
    a.start()
    a
  }

  def future[T](body: => T): Future[T] = {
  ...
```

This would allow switching back from CPS to direct-style withough changing Future's API. I tried it, and this (almost) works now:

```scala
import scala.actors._, scala.actors.Actor._, scala.actors.Futures._

val a = actor { loop { react { case i:Int => Thread.sleep(2000); reply(i*2) } } }
val f = a !! (3, {case x:Int => x})
val r = f map { _ + 1 }

f() // necessary because of SI-3412

println(future(r)())
```

Almost, since it crashes if you take out the `f()`, because of #3412.
Ok, now that Philipp has fixed #3412 in record time (thanks a bunch, Philipp!), the `f()` is no longer necessary, and

```scala
import scala.actors._, scala.actors.Actor._, scala.actors.Futures._

val a = actor { loop { react { case i:Int => Thread.sleep(2000); reply(i*2) } } }
val f = a !! (3, {case x:Int => x})
val r = f map { _ + 1 }

println(future(r)())
```

works if future[T](resp: Responder[T]) is added to Futures.
I'm going to take the liberty of marking this as fixed, although to take advantage of this you'll need to use the new future, `scala.concurrent.Future` from [SIP-14](http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/futures-promises.html)
