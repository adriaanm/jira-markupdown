The behavior is what is expected with the new implementation of arrays and collections: th array implementation is now much simpler and efficient, and Arrays are seen by the language as actual Java arrays. We cannot work around the behavior you observed unless more magic is added to type inference, which would go against the overall simplification that we are trying to achieve. With your example, an additional type annotation will make it work again:
{code}
scala> def z:Seq[Int] = if(true) Array[Int](3) else Seq[Int](3)
z: Seq[Int]
{code}
