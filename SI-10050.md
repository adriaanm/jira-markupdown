When the conditions for SI-9828 are met (old Java runtime), it would be a good idea to warn users who might not be aware of the issue.
Right, SI-9828 says it's using Scala 2.10.4, so it's not specific to Scala 2.12.

I assume the bug only exists in early JDK 8 releases, but not in any JDK 6 or 7 releases, so we should do an appropriate filter.
Well, I was going for harsh. This is an issue that might break Production environments. The only solution to get rid of the error would be to upgrade the JDK to a non-affected version or to explicitly disable the behavior.

Adding a warning on a development machine is probably not going to do much good.

As for not controlling the runtime, well, you could add a val to {{scala.Predef}}. It would only be calculated once and probably during the runtime's startup phase.
