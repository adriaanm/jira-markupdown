When the content assist suggests completions, it should to an incremental search (filter) of its suggestions based on the current prefix. At least it should recognize such prefixes when a choice is made, and overwrite it, instead of inserting the whole choice, and moving the prefix to the right. For example, 

` v.wi| ` shows a list of two possible completions: 'height and width'. I choose 'width' and I get: ` v.widthwi `
