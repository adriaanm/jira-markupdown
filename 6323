The method {{findEntry}} is useful when you want to replace a {{Map[T, T]}} with a {{Set[T]}}. That is, when the equality method does not cover other state of {{T}} that you need.

For example, imagine a symbol table in an interpreter where each symbol {{S}} is associated with it's definition. When you find an assignment to {{S}}, you need to create a new definition for {{S}}, or change the value in the old definition, so that whatever else was referring the previous definition still does so. In such a case, you try to find {{S}} in the set, and change that, or add a new {{S}} to it if not present.

Or, put in more stark terms, you need {{findEntry}} when equality is not a replacement for identity.

As a side note, a {{Set}} with {{findEntry}} can be used to implement a {{Map}}.
