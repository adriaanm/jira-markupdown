Pinging @soc: Since you've done a lot of refactoring in the compiler, would you be willing to help with cleaning up the -Xlint warnings in the compiler/library code? I can also help, but I'm fully booked until the beginning of august.

{code}
[quick.library] 12 warnings found
[quick.reflect] 9 warnings found
[quick.compiler] 28 warnings found
[quick.repl] 7 warnings found
[quick.actors] 8 warnings found
[quick.scalap] four warnings found
[quick.partest] 10 warnings found
[quick.scaladoc] four warnings found
[quick.interactive] two warnings found
[quick.plugins] one warning found
{code}
Most of the warnings are legit, but some may require improving -Xlint.

- the repl is full of code which looks like the interpolator has been forgotten, but it is generating names like '$line' and there is a line in scope. This is not the common case outside of the compiler. Not sure how to deal with it, but you could use different identifiers in generated code than are used in the repl.

- if you have a thing like "var (a, b) = bippy" and one of those vars is never set, it will say "that could be a val." But it can't be a val without some shuffling, because you only get one keyword.

- constant folding happens before it sees anything, which means "private object Bar { final val x = 123 }" will generate a warning that Bar is never used, even if x is inlined somewhere. Not sure how to handle this one either.

For cases 1 and 3 we could have a @nolint annotation to avoid the warnings:
{code}
@noImplicitFound("No implicit available ${from} to ${to}": @nolint)
{code}
{code}
private object Bar { @nolint final val x = 123 }
{code}

Regarding your first point ... what about some explicit $ string interpolator, which leaves $ alone?

I would tackle the third point by outright removing constant folding (SI-7542 is related), but then I have to figure out SI-7174 first, I guess.

Anyway, I'll file bugs for those things where either lint could act a bit smarter or where a different approach is necessary.

Thanks for the hints!
