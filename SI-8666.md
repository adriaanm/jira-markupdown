next code:
{code}
object A {
  val init = println("hello")
}

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
      val a = A.init
  }
}
{code}

produces no output, but "hello" is expected.
This behaviour was observed when trying code described here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24221601/scala-object-initialization
This relates to SI-5304, which shows other examples where the object initialization is elided.

This particular instance comes down to:

{code}
//src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/TypeAdaptingTransformer.scala
          case UnitClass  =>
            if (treeInfo isExprSafeToInline tree) REF(BoxedUnit_UNIT)
            else BLOCK(tree, REF(BoxedUnit_UNIT))
{code}

`isExprSafeToInline` is insufficient, we have to check whether the tree is safe to elide.
