Troubles happen because typechecking isn't idempotent w.r.t lazy vals. Details:
* https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/b4b91dcb58b5804f7ec1513e8f4d1e4534fd8018#diff-15 (Note the $lzy suffix)
* https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/62614a6f9f7c335cf53f464ce272ac05979f5647 (IMPLICIT flag gets erased during typechecking)
