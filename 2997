@rytz: my observation is that the error only shows up in the eclipse code(text) editor sidebar and not(!) in the "Markers" view. Further it gets already displayed during editing and not after saving the resource. I don't know too much about the eclipse "code validation while editing" internals but it seems to me that the error marker is generated before compiling the resource.
...and the compiled code runs as expected.
???
