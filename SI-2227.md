Content assist is absolutely not working for me.

Environment:

Scala Eclipse Plugin 2.8.0.r18428-b20090802023619

Eclipse 3.5.0

Java 1.6.0_14

Windows XP SP3

I have two simple classes:

file C1.scala:

```scala
package pack

class C1 {
	/**
	 * @param x 
	 *        the first Operand
	 * @param y
	 *        the second Operand
	 * @return the sum
	 */
	def f1(x:Int,y:Int) :Int = x+y

}
```

file C2.scala:

```scala
package pack

class C2 {
	def f2() : Int =
	{
	    val c1inst : C1 = new C1()
		
	    c1inst.f1()
	}

}
```

There are the following problems when editing C2.scala:

- when beginning to type c1inst (after its declaration), there are no completions offered with Ctrl-Space after having typed, say, "c1".[[BR]]
- after typing ".", there are no proposals.[[BR]]
- even after hitting Ctrl-Space, there are no proposals.[[BR]]
- when hitting Ctrl-Space after "c1inst.f", the only proposal is "fall-through".[[BR]]
- inside the parentheses of c1inst.f1(), no parameter hints with Ctrl-Shift-Space.[[BR]]
- I see no way to display the documentation comment for function C1.f1 at the call in C2.f2, which would at least help a little in the absence of parameter hints.

Am I doing something wrong? Maybe some stupid errors in my the test code - I am absolutely new to Scala?

BTW it does not help if C1.scala is open in another editor window.
