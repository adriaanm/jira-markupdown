A common beginner mistake is illustrated by the following example:
trait Doubler[T] {
  def double(t: T) : T   // "double" the value
}
class IntFoo[Int] extends Foo[Int] {
  def double(t: Int) = t * 2
}

The user thinks she has specified the Int type for T, but actually the word "Int" is just a new name for the generic type parameter. In this example, a mystifying compile error results:
 "value * is not a member of Int"

I believe we should minimize such frustrations ;) A solution is to either disallow type parameter names that match type names in scope or at least warn when they are used. A warning could suggest that user probably meant to say "class IntFoo extends Foo[Int]".
(In r20064) Improve error message for selection from a type parameter. Fixes SI-2702.
