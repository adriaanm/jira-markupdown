Writing an explicit companion object for a case class interferes with type inference for the auto-generated apply() method. Take the following code:

```scala
def f(g: (String, Int) => Any) = null

case class A(x: String, y: Int)
case class B(x: String, y: Int)
object B

val v1 = f(A.apply _)
val v2 = f(A)
val v3 = f(B.apply _)
val v4 = f(B)
```

v1, v2, and v3 compile.

v4 fails with:

```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : this.B.type (with underlying type object this.B)
 required: (String, Int) => Any
val v4 = f(B)
```

It seems that the explicit companion object prevents the proper Function trait from being mixed in automatically.
