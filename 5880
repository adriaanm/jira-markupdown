I would say this is another duplicate of scala/bug#1570, or at least closely related. From cursory inspection, I suspect variance indeed causes the problems. 

There's a check in the inferencer (in adjustTypeArgs) to see whether Nothing indicates inference failure (in which case, it is rolled back) or is a valid instantiation. Nothing is assumed to be a failure if: "[the type parameter for which Nothing was inferred] occurs in an invariant/contravariant position in `restpe`".
