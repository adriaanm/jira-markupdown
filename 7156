Another use-case for this is a compile-time test that a given expression should _not_ compile. Eg. suppose we have a type class Foo[T] which should not have instances for String, then it would be highly desirable to be able to write a test of the form,

{code}
shouldNotCompile(implicitly[Foo[String]])
{code}

which typechecks _iff_ implicitly[Foo[String]] does not typecheck.
