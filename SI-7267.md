If a user creates a new Duration without the DSL via the "def
apply(length: Long, unit: String): FiniteDuration" interface, it is possible to pass a nonsense unit value, as demonstrated by Ben James (@bmjames).  It then throws a RuntimeException (java.util.NoSuchElementException).  This String argument should be validated at compile time.
You might parse the duration from a config file.

The valid inputs are documented:

{code}
  /**
   * Construct a finite duration from the given length and time unit, where the latter is
   * looked up in a list of string representation. Valid choices are:
   *
   * `d, day, h, hour, min, minute, s, sec, second, ms, milli, millisecond, Âµs, micro, microsecond, ns, nano, nanosecond`
   * and their pluralized forms (for every but the first mentioned form of each unit, i.e. no "ds", but "days").
   */
  def apply(length: Long, unit: String): FiniteDuration   = new FiniteDuration(length,  Duration.timeUnit(unit))
{code}

I don't really see the issue here.
[~shinolajla] [~bmjames] Throwing exceptions is an inherent part of the design of the {{Duration}} interface.  Allowing time units at all, but enforcing a base of nanoseconds, means that the user can enter, either in a {{String}} or as a {{Long}}, an invalid value that will generate an exception (e.g. try 107000 days).  One can suggest that the interface be deprecated and improved somehow (make everything return {{Option}}?), but I think that goes beyond what is asked for here.  Even {{+}} on a {{FiniteDuration}} can throw an exception.

The simple change of making this particular method checked at compile-time when possible doesn't really fix the generic issue, and the generic issue isn't a minor change.  You can open a bug request against the tougher issue that {{Duration}} uses exceptions to communicate error states, but it doesn't make sense to try to fix this piecemeal.
