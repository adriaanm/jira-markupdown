=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
Look at the nightly doc of scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer#readOnly:
{code}
expose the underlying list but do not mark it as exported@return A sequence which refers to this buffer for all its operations.
{code} 
The line with @return is just appended instead of shown like in other documentation.

The problem seems to appear when the documentation of the overriding method lacks a @return documentation (and the overridden has one), but has other documentation text.


=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The line with @return should be displayed like in the other methods' docs.
