The check in https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/library/scala/collection/parallel/package.scala#L44 ...

{code}
  private[parallel] def getTaskSupport: TaskSupport =
    if (scala.util.Properties.isJavaAtLeast("1.6")) {
      val vendor = scala.util.Properties.javaVmVendor
      if ((vendor contains "Oracle") || (vendor contains "Sun") || (vendor contains "Apple")) new ForkJoinTaskSupport
      else new ThreadPoolTaskSupport
    } else new ThreadPoolTaskSupport
{code}

... is not sufficient to choose the “best” task support library available.

Example case is Avian where, despite the existence of ForkJoin, ThreadPools are used.

One approach could be to check for {{scala.util.Properties.isJavaAtLeast("1.7"))}} and enable ForkJoin without further vendor checks, because one can reasonably expect that if a platform declares Java 7 support it actually does.
Additionally, it would make sense to add some check to the detection code for a command line argument so that the task support choice can be overridden and therefore all code paths can be tested.
One example of issues caused by not being able to test this code is SI-7236.
This check was copied from the old stdlib actors library.
Always enabling FJP under the following condition:

{code}
scala.util.Properties.isJavaAtLeast("1.7"))
{code}

looks ok to me. Feel free to open a pull request.
