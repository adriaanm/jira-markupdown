I think there is definitely something strange going on when it is trying to resolve the deathname symbol.  However, I do not know what the precise rules are for what would cause Scala to try looking in deathname.scala to try to resolve the reference, so I'm assigning this to Martin.  For what it is worth, I can reproduce this with unrelated.scala as:
{code}
object Outer {
  deathname
}

()
{code}
