I notice that now http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/01-lexical-syntax.html no longer refers to {{printableChar}}.

However, most of the non-terminals meant to be associated with the character-classes list right before section 1.1 ({{digit}}, {{lower}}, {{letter}}, {{lower}}, {{upper}}, and {{opchar}}) are in the same boat.  (Referenced non-terminals are not actually defined in non-summary chapters.)

Similarly, I think that that list should be accompanied by (or possibly replaced by) ENBF entries for those non-terminals (copied from what already exists in the syntax summary chapter).
