The following code fails with SOF in 2.11.3-SNAPSHOT (it works fine with 2.11.2). This is particularly annoying in the IDE, when the error happens while typing.

Note that if I fix the error (complete Str to String), there is no crash.

I tried with with {{2.11.3-20141006-171745-8d25e84c91}}

{code:title=Foo.scala|java|borderStyle=solid}
package foo

class A {
  /** The other */
  def bar(x: Int): Unit = ???
  def bar(x: Str): Unit = ???
}

class B {
  (new A).bar(0)
}
{code}
