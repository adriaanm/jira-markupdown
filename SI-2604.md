It is really useful to extract a map from a 1-dimensional collection, such as:

    val cities = List("London", "Paris")
    cities.mapBy(_.length) // Map (5 -> Paris, 6 -> London)

This would throw an IllegalArgumentException if tow values mapped to the same key. A dumb scala 2.7 impl (on Iterable[V]) would look like:

  def mapBy[K](f: V => K) = (Map[K,V]() /: this) { (m, v) => 
    m.get(f(v)) match {
      case None => m + (f(v) -> v)
      case Some(_) => throw new IllegalArgumentException
  }
I'm not sure whether we should add this to the std library, given how easy it is to do yourself:

{code}
scala> Map(List("London", "Paris") map {x => (x.length, x)} : _*)
res0: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,java.lang.String] = Map(6 -> London, 5 -> Paris)

{code}
see also duplicate SI-2605
You can also use 'map' directly with the new 'breakOut' CanBuildFrom introduced by SI-19493 (nice work), to build a Map, or anything else for that matter. Like so:

{code}
> import scala.collection.breakOut
> val map : Map[Int,String] = List("London", "Paris").map(x => (x.length, x))(breakOut)
map: Map[Int,String] = Map(6 -> London, 5 -> Paris)
{code}

Bit more elegant, and more efficient I imagine, than passing an intermediate data structure to the Map factory object:

{code}
val map = Map(List("London", "Paris").map { x => (x.length,x) }: _*)
{code}

Don't think a special 'mapBy' or 'mapTo' is useful enough to merit being added. Plus these method names could lead to increased confusion between 'map' the generic method on collections, and Map the particular kind of collection.

excellent point, matthw! I wonder why I didn't think of that myself :-) (guess I was too busy (re)closing the tickets)
Sorry, but the bugtracking system is not the place to be trained in Scala. Please continue this discussion in the scala lounge mailing list. I'm closing it one last time. Here's how you make it less verbose:

{code}

scala> val cities = List("London", "Paris")
cities: List[java.lang.String] = List(London, Paris)

scala> import scala.collection.breakOut

scala> (cities.map(x => (x.length, x))(breakOut): Map[Int, String]).foreach { case (len, city) => println (len+ " "+ city)}
6 London
5 Paris

@moors - I hardly think that is a fair comment. You provided an example which was less readable than mine and did not (I feel) adequantely address the problem. I wasn't aware of the other way of expressing this (I've never seen any code use the syntax before, including in the scala library), so hardly realized that I needed "training".

It doesn't seem unreasonable for those less experienced in scala to register and argue for RFE's; I don't entirely appreciate the scolding :-/
