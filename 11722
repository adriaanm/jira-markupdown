Here's another interaction that hopefully will also be caught (shadowing a val in this case).  Credit to TimSoethout for finding this and bringing it up on the gitter channel.
```scala
object P {
  case class C(content: String)
  object C { implicit val x = C("companion") }

  // Uncomment this and u and v will resolve the same (to the companion above!)
  //val x = "fish"

  object O {
    object First { implicit val x = C("First") }
    object Second { implicit val x = C("Second") }
    import First._
    val u = implicitly[C]
    import Second._
    val v = implicitly[C]
  }

  val weird = (O.u,O.v)
}
P.weird
```
