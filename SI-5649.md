the following code:
```scala
object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    class C {def f[B](b: B):Int ={println("C"); 1}}
    class CC extends C {def f(i: Any):String = {println("CC"); "" }}
    new CC().f(1)
    (new CC():C).f(1)
  }
}
```
should fail with "method f needs `override' modifier" and "method f has incompatible type"
instead it compiles and prints "CC\nC"

tested with scala-2.10.0-20120406-151649-1a6408c429 2.9.1 and 2.9.2-RC3
Hi Paul

ok, I might have confused you with a not very well crafted sample
here is a better one:
```scala
class c{def f[B](b: B):Int = 1; def f(b: AnyRef):String = "" }
```
this shouldn't compile, since these samples
```scala
 class c{def f[B](b: B):Int = 1; def f(b: AnyRef):Int = 1 }
```
```scala
class c{def f(b: AnyRef):Int = 1; def f(b: AnyRef):String = "" }
```
do not

otherwise it seems overloading by return type is allowed and only if one of the methods is generic and the other is not
would be happy if you could point me to a relevant section in the spec which allows this
I can offer some noobish ideas.

There is no "relevant section in the spec which *dis*allows this".
Matching members is Definition 5.1.4 in Section 5.1.3.
The third new example matches on #2, the first doesn't match either #2/#4
(which goes to: "one of the methods is generic and the other is not").
The second example is disallowed because of erasure (as the error says).

The first example is useful because you can distinguish c.f(7) and c.f("s").
On the Scala side, the sigs don't match, and on the classfile side, the methods are
disambiguated by return type.

Elsewhere, Paul has supplied a similarly perverse example:

```scala
object Test {

  def m(x: String): Int = x.length

  def m(x: String with T forSome {type T}): String = x.reverse

  def main(a: Array[String]) {
    println(m("abc"): Int)
    println(m("abc"): String)
  }
}
```
That's correct.  The spec offers no way for a monomorphic and polymorphic method to match if they have arguments.  That the non-compiling examples don't compile is because no two methods can have the same type after erasure; this is an implementation restriction.

So again, as specified.
