Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19371-b20091102102036 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

This is a build manager issue that can be reproduced using !BuildManagerTest.


Given the following in their respective source files (A.scala, B.scala, C.scala)

```scala
object A {
	def x: Int = 3
}
object B {
	def onX(m: { def x: Int } ) =
		o.x
}
object C {
	def main(args: Array[String]) =
		println(B.onX(A))
}
```
 1. Compile all sources
 1. Run C, no error
 1. Change A.x:
```scala
	def x: Byte = 3
```
 1. Mark A as updated.
 1. Manager will recompile A, but not C.
 1. !ClassCastException occurs at runtime instead of the compile error that occurs when C is recompiled.
