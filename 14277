If you have a Scala project and you included a java project and it includes another java project that has exported classpath entries, these classpath entries do not get included in the top level project when compiling and you get compiler errors.

Example:
ProjectA
ProjectB
ProjectC

ProjectA has a dependency on ProjectB
ProjectB has a dependency on ProjectC which exports a classpath entry for JarA

when ProjectA is compiled, scala files do not compile because JarA is not in the classpath.

The fix is to put JarA in the classpath of ProjectA, but that really isn't desired.
