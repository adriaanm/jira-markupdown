=== What steps will reproduce the problem ===

```scala
def x[N[_]] = ()

trait ExistT[M[_]] {
  x[M]
}
```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Compiles okay, as per 2.8.1

=== What do you see instead? ===

=== Additional information ===

No crash after s/trait/class/.

I was actually trying to reproduce the following spurious compile error from the scalaz branch for Scala 2.9.x, from this tree: https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/tree/3a58739500416eeda09d5150a2f3f7d1db2ad86e

I plan to isolate it further and lodge a separate ticket.

```scala

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.r24073-b20110124174250
Oddly this compiles (and runs) fine for me with versions of scala both before and after yours.  Are you giving it a command line option or something?
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.r24136-b20110128174513 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22).

     |   def x[N[_]] = ()
     | 
     |   trait ExistT[M[_]] {
     |     x[M]
     |   }
     | }
defined module o

scala> o.x

Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.r24068-b20110123233401 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_22).

     |   def x[N[_]] = ()

     | }

```
Oh darn. I was running it as a script. Working that back to something I can demonstrate in vanilla scalac:

```scala
object Main {
  def x[N[_]] = ()

  def main = {
    class $$anon { // rename to 'anon' to get rid of crash
      object scratch {

        trait ExistT[M[_]] { // s/trait/class/ to get rid of crash
          x[M]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Gives:

  class $$anon { // rename to 'anon' to get rid of crash
    object scratch {
      trait ExistT { // s/trait/class/ to get rid of crash
        x
      }
    }
  }
}
```

look ma, no type constructors!
Looks like I need to work on my minimization skills. 'tcpoly' tag duly removed.

For the record, my use of '$$' was just to replicate the inner machinations of the script runner. The following crashes, when run as a script.

script.scala: `def x{};trait X{x}`

Here's another example, distilled from Specs:

```scala
object t4202 {
  () => {
    trait T {
      def t = ()
    }
    object T2 extends T {
      t
    }
  }
}
```
Replying to [comment:7 retronym]:
> Here's another example, distilled from Specs:

That looks an awful lot like #2897, which is:
```scala
 def f1(t: String) = {
    trait T {
      def xs = Nil map (_ => t)
    }
    ()
  }
```
Not exactly the same bug I don't think, just brothers.
Actually they are the same bug I think.  By the way "object T2" in your comment doesn't have any bearing on the bug, it crashes fine without it.

Putting r24206 to work, here it is after lazyvals:

```scala
// I'm using: () => { trait T { def t = () } }
  object t4202 final
      constructor t4202 
      value <local t4202> 
          anonymous class $$anonfun final <synthetic>
              constructor $$anonfun 
              method apply final
              method apply final <bridge>
              value <local $$anonfun> 
```

And then here after lambdalift.  Notice the trait implementation class is being renamed to "T$$class$$1" which is pretty clearly wrong.  I'm able to push the error downfield by excluding .isImplClass but the problem is deeper.

```scala
  object t4202 final
      anonymous class $$anonfun$$1 final <synthetic>
          constructor $$anonfun$$1 
          method apply final
          method apply final <bridge>
*         trait T$$1 abstract
*             method t 
*             value <local T> 
*             value t4202$$$$anonfun$$T$$$$$$outer <synthetic> <stable>
*         trait T$$class$$1 abstract
*             method $$init$$ 
*             method t 
*             value <local T$$class> 
          value <local $$anonfun> 
```
Well, I thought it was clearly wrong based on the fact that 1406/1406 implementation classes in trunk have a name ending in "$$class".  But 2.8.1 does compile it with that name, so maybe it's not wrong.
```scala
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    309 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$$$anonfun$$1$$T$$1.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    442 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$$$anonfun$$1$$T$$class$$1.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    754 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$$$anonfun$$1.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    407 Feb  6 01:08 t4202$$.class
-rw-r--r--  1 paulp  staff    435 Feb  6 01:08 t4202.class
```
Drives me nuts trying to infer everything from the implementation.  Is this documented somewhere?
as I understand it, the fix for this is simple: don't give interpreter wrappers blingy names (might I suggest replacing $$ by CHF?)

we don't officially deal in dollars anyway (at least not in user-supplied names)

Paul, I'm sorry I can't provide more insight on the use of the dollar in generated names, but I think we can settle for a pragmatic solution here. Could the deeper problem simply be that calling this class `$$anon` triggers a conversion that's not meant to be done in here?  

```scala
    val ANON_CLASS_NAME: NameType    = "$$anon"
[...]
    final def isAnonymousClass    = isClass && (name containsName tpnme.ANON_CLASS_NAME)
```
As described in the comments above, the same assertion trips with the following, but maybe that's a different bug.

```scala
object t4202 {
  () => {
    trait T {
      def t = ()
    } 
  }
}
```
(In r24326) Closes #4202 and removes empty TreeHashMap (superseded by HashMap implementation). No review
This still crashes as of r24432.
```scala
object t4202 {
  () => {
    trait T {
      def t = ()
    }
    object T2 extends T {
      t
    }
  }
}
```
(In r24527) Closes #4202 again, closes #4363. if someone can enlighten me why we actually had that exclusion for companion objects in the first place I would be grateful. review by odersky

For whatever you may be able to make of that.
