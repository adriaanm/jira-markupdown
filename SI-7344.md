```scala
$ cat spec-local.scala 
object Test {
  def meth = {
    def specMe[@specialized(Int) T](t: T) = ???
  }
}

$ ../build/quick/bin/scalac -Xprint:specialize spec-local.scala 
[[syntax trees at end of                specialize]] // spec-local.scala
package <empty> {
  object Test extends Object {
    def <init>(): Test.type = {
      Test.super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def meth(): Unit = {
      // specMe doesn't deserve specialization? :(
      def specMe[@specialized(scala.Int) T >: Nothing <: Any](t: T): Nothing = scala.this.Predef.???();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

A question is whether this was overlooked or is there a serious reason that specialization does not visit local methods. Btw, this bit us while working on https://github.com/nicolasstucki/specialized/.
