Type inference is not spec'ed, essentially. It's also not that easy to improve it without breaking existing code. We are certainly interested in improving it overall, but I hesitate to add an ad-hoc hack for this case. It needs to be an all-encompassing improvement, with assurances about the effect on existing code, understandability,... That's not going to happen right away. It's just too hard, sorry.
