The nightly pdf builds of the spec have for a while fallen into latexese in section 12.1 just when I was about to find out who killed colonel mustard.
```scala
	In	this	case	T â€²	is	\lstinline@C #D 
@	(or \lstinline@C#D[tps]@, respectively), whereas T itself 
would expand to \lstinline@C.this.D[tps]@
```
etc.
Line 7445 of `src/reference/ReferencePart.tex` should be
```scala
\end{lstlisting}
```

instead of 
```scala
\begin{lstlisting}
```
(In r21976) Fixed open lstlisting, closes #3451.
