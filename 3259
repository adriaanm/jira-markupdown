Regression introduced in r19570 which was to fix SI-2454.

Trouble was anticipated.  Quoth Adriaan: "this works for now (will check fix in today), but we can't guarantee this will keep working due to the hairy interaction between the necessity of cooking raw java types to existentially quantified scala types (this only happens for types of symbols that are accessed or overridden) and simply treating these types as higher-kinded types"
