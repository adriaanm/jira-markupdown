The editor ignores tab settings in Preferences/General/Editors/TextEditors/. I set it to tab space = 2 and 'insert spaces instead of tabs'. 

Pressing Tab inserts a '\t' AND two spaces, no matter what settings I set in the above panel. I have the impression the 2.7.3 plugin behaved correctly.

I'm using Eclipse 3.4.1 on Linux, and the nightly plugin from Feb. 18 (r17137).
I still can't reproduce this ... I only ever get two spaces for a tab.

Could you try and produce a trivial example project with a fresh workspace?
Yep, it happens with a new workspace and new project. Here's my source code:

```scala
package test

class Foo {
  def bar {
    println("hello, world!")
    
  }

}
```
Hitting TAB when the cursor is aligned with println introduces a \t. Hitting the left and right arrows, makes the cursor jump 4 spaces, while hitting left a few more times makes it move only by one space towards the beginning of the line.
OK, I've found the issue ... it's the Java Formatter which is controlling this behaviour.

I'll disable that, but as an immediate workaround got to Preferences => Java => Code Style => Formatter => New ... then enter a name for the new profile, then select "Tabs only" for Tab policy, select "Use tabs only for leading indentations" and set "Tab size" to 2.
It's still buggy. With a freshly installed Eclipse 3.4.2 (Ubuntu Linux) and Scala plug-in 2.7.5 it puts 2 spaces per indentation level when you press Enter (that's okay following the Scala formatting convention. I like this predefined setting) and 4 (or more) spaces when you press TAB at some points, for example:

```scala
object Main {
|<--- From here it jumps 4 spaces when you press TAB
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
|<--- From here it jumps even more, 10 spaces! when you press TAB
  }
}
```
Unfortunately not:
```scala
object x {
  def x = {
      |<--- Indented (with spaces) to here
  }
}
```
