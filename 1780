Can you provide a few more breadcrumbs as to what you did, because I thought that I tried the experiment you describe (changing build.xml to refer to the plugin versions of the jars) and did not see what you say you saw.  If I take the references to scala out of build.xml, it won't work -- I have to put something in its place, and what would that be?

And also:

"remove the "java.lang" prefixes from the uses of "java.lang.Object" in the Java source files indicated in the output from the command line build."

By this, do you mean the command line build that I will get once I make the changes to build.xml, as soon as I can figure out what changes you had in mind?

Just curious, but why do you think it is the best use of every one's time for ME to ineptly explain the problem that YOU understand to the Scala compiler team?  Is this just a test to see if I think the problem is important enough to be worth reporting, and if I don't, then it must not be worth fixing?  Because I am also a busy person, and I have already spent a fair amount of time on this, and I do not have any more time to spend this week, or even this weekend, and I am thinking about taking some vacation next week.
