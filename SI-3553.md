I recently got this error...

  error: illegal cyclic reference involving method foo

which had me scratching my head for a while. I still don't quite grok why scalac couldn't have figured out the return method type in question - but it would be useful if this error message was something like...

 error: illegal cyclic reference involving method foo. You could try adding an explicit return type on method foo

then I'd have immediately known what was wrong. Newbies will find the current error message very confusing.  The only way I could figure it out after lots of head scratching was googling...

Replying to [comment:1 dragos]:

There are various kinds of illegal cyclic references, but is it possible to have an illegal cyclic reference on a **method** which is not fixable using a return method?

How about if the error message is about an illegal cyclic **method** - and the method in question has no explicit return type, we mention the solution **may** be to add an explicit return type? (If we just include the may/might word then folks would at least think of it as a possible solution).

FWIW the method which caused the issue for me was of this form...

class Something {
  val bar = new Bar

  def foo = bar.something.filter( _.isSomething )
}

class Bar {
  def something: Seq[Cheese[_]] = {...}
}

the code which generated the error was of this form...

val s = new Something
import s._
foo

that last block of code camel out wrong. Try this...

```scala
    val s = new Something 
    import s._ 
    foo
```
