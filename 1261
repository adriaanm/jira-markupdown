As a potent illustration of this, if you apply the following changes to SourceFile.scala, Scanners will generate the intended switch statement and stack usage is dramatically lessened - from a recursion depth of about 130 down to 30.
{code}
-  val LF: Char = 0x0A
-  val FF: Char = 0x0C
-  val CR: Char = 0x0D
-  val SU: Char = 0x1A
+  final val LF = '\u000A'
+  final val FF = '\u000C'
+  final val CR = '\u000D'
+  final val SU = '\u001A'
{code}
