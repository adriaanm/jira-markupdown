For the time being, here is a more distilled crasher:
```scala
object Obj

trait O { self: Obj.type =>
  Nil foreach identity
}
```
The problem is that anonymous function objects inside a template which has an explicit singleton self-type get confused trying to find their $$outer pointer, encountering a type error like this:
```scala
Exception in thread "main" scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$TypeError: type mismatch;
 found   : O.this.type (with underlying type O with Obj.type)
 required: O with Obj.type
```
I'm guessing this will come down to a small bugfix somewhere which takes self-type into account instead of naively using the name of the enclosing template, but I haven't hit upon the right spot just yet.
