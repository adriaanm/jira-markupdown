the `Main` class in scalap added an `unpickleFromAnnotation` method to support the new pickle format.

The equivalent functionality has not yet been made to the ScalaSigParser singleton, which now won't show type params.  As per this mail: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala.user/29335

Classifying as "compiler" because there's no component type for scalap and I can't think of anywhere better :)
(In r22669) Generalized the scala sig "look in both attribute and annotation" code
so it can be reused outside of scalap main.  Closes #3717, review by ilyas.
