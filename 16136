It's a consistent annoyance that there is no in-place (i.e. mutating) "filter" for mutable collections (or at least none that I can find!). Where one has a predicate, the best I can do is:
```scala
    shrinkable --= (shrinkable.view filter pred)
```

I think Shrinkable should contain one extra method:
```scala
    def shrink(p : A => Boolean) : this.type
```
The previous code then becomes the much cleaner and clearer:
```scala
    shrinkable shrink pred
```
