OK, yes, that config breaks ctl-D. I'll take a look at what's going on. (OK, I see there's a mapping for ctl-D. Maybe REPL can test for that or subvert it when pasting. Actually readline doc says it should take ctl-D as EOF at beginning of empty line. There is noise at JLine2/3 around this issue.)

Meanwhile, the workaround is to use here doc syntax:

{code}
$ scala
Welcome to Scala 2.11.8 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_101).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> :pa << DONE
// Entering paste mode (DONE to finish)

val i = 42
DONE

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

i: Int = 42

scala> 
{code}

I think it's fair to say, I had the last laugh on here doc syntax. Or, maybe every dumb idea looks smart once.
