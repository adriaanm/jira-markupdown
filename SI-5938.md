The attached program (bug.scala) compiles and runs correctly when initially built.  However, if I trivially modify the source file via the editor or 'touch' and then recompile, the JVM fails with a "Duplicate method name&signature" exception.

Specifically:

  $ fsc -shutdown; fsc -max-idle 0
  [Compile server exited]
      [...elided...]
  Disabling idle timeout on compile server.
  $ scala ca.blit.bug.W
  $ touch bug.scala
  $ fsc bug.scala
  $ scala ca.blit.bug.W
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&signature in class file ca/blit/bug/W
  	at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
  	at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:634)
  	at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(SecureClassLoader.java:14
  [...]

Restarting the compile server between builds seems to be sufficient to produce correct output; you don't need to delete the existing class files.

Downgrading to Scala 2.9.1-1 fixed the problem.

Since 2.11.0-RC1 is one week away, pushing all non-blockers without PR to 2.11.1-RC1. Please undo the change if I missed work in progress.
