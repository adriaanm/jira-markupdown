Hey catching, I said CATCH!  InterruptedException, I said!

This is kinda sorta documented, so arguably it was just my failure to RTFM. But it does seem odd to me that if I **explicitly** say I want to catch that exception, it doesn't override the shouldRethrow stuff.

Priority: low, no doubt. Opening the ticket anyway.
