See also SI-3032 (which was closed) which is crashing in the same spot.  I found this trying to track down a different very mysterious bug where things just start exhausting the heap, seemingly getting lost somewhere in ZipArchive.  But I think now it may be a manifestation of an -optimise bug.

Abstract types are exercised harder than usual in the ZipArchive code, if you're looking for a culprit.  Also, the line I keep seeing in stack traces after heap exhaustion is here:
{code}
  abstract class Entry(name: String, path: String) extends VirtualFile(name, path) {
    final override def path = "%s(%s)".format(URLZipArchive.this, super.path)
{code}
Looks a little heavy on identifier "path", are we maybe mis-optimizing ourselves into an infinite loop?
Fun fun! Sometime between r21000 and RC1 the example reported above started working:
{code}
scala> scala.tools.nsc.io.ZipArchive.fromPath("/local/lib/java/winstone.jar") foreach println
/local/lib/java/winstone.jar(winstone/)
/local/lib/java/winstone.jar(META-INF/)
/local/lib/java/winstone.jar(jndi.properties)
/local/lib/java/winstone.jar(javax/)
{code}
However I only know this because I was trying to find out when pending/run/bug3150.scala starting throwing a verify error under -optimise.  When I started backtracking it quickly switched into this mixinImplClassMembers crasher.  I'm guessing they're not connected, but that the crasher was masking this bug.

It's definitely related to it claiming to be equal to null: if I change the equals method to "null != other" it no longer crashes.  I realize the language (now) requires you to be unequal to null, but the penalty for violating this should be inconsistent equality, not invalid bytecode.

{code}
object Test {
  case object Bob { override def equals(other: Any) = true }
  def f(x: Any) = x match { case Bob => Bob }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = f(Bob)
}
{code}
{code}
