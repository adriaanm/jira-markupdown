```scala
scala> trait A { val x: A }
defined trait A

scala> trait B { val x: B }
defined trait B

scala> class C extends A with B { lazy val x = new C }
defined class C

scala> class D extends A with B { lazy val x = new D }
defined class D

scala> if (true) new C else new D
res0: ScalaObject with A with B = C@662ad0d
```

In 2.9 the type of res0 was ScalaObject with A with B { val x: ScalaObject with A with B }.
