It was a bug in GenASM's `getCommonSuperclass()`, which failed to account for the `scala.runtime.Nothing$` we emit for methods with `Nothing` return-type.

The JVM-wise lub was set to `j.l.Object` when it should have been `j.l.Throwable` as shown below (lub of 
`j.l.Throwable`  and `scala.runtime.Nothing$`  is `j.l.Throwable` )

 With {{-Yinline-handlers}}, the protected minimized snippet includes two assignments to local slot 1 (ASM notation): 
```
// single covered block
   L0
    ALOAD 0
    LDC "abc"
    INVOKEVIRTUAL Test.error (Ljava/lang/String;)Lscala/runtime/Nothing$;
    ASTORE 1 // without inlineEH there's a THROW here
. . . 
// start of the start block of the exception handler
   FRAME SAME1 java/lang/Throwable
    ASTORE 1
    ALOAD 0
    INVOKEVIRTUAL Test.CertainException ()Ljava/lang/Throwable;
. . .
```
