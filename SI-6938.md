Size of RedBlack$BlackTree types are taking up unexpectedly large amounts of heap space. Users on platforms with limited resources can't use these collections so long as they create so many instances for each entry.
Extracted from https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6825
We should consider this fixed by https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4147 once it's in.
I have just tried to change {{mutable.TreeSet}} so that it uses a mutable red-black tree (added in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4504) as its underlying data structure. Everything worked well, {{ant test}} yields no issues and the changes seem to be source-compatible. However, as its underlying data changed, it may happen that users that serialized a {{mutable.TreeSet}} with a previous version of Scala will find out that its binary representation is no longer valid after such a modification (the current serialization stability tests do not include `mutable.TreeMap`).

[~ichoran], does this prevent such a change to be included in Scala 2.12? If not, I can do a pull request later.
