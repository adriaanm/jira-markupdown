Paul and me stumbled upon this during ScalaDays. It doesn't seem to be fixed in trunk yet and I couldn't find a ticket so I'm creating one...

There is a check in {{Inliners.scala}} that prevents inlining of private methods (their call sites are invokespecial, not invokevirtual = Dynamic):
{code}
for (i <- bb) {
  i match {
    case CALL_METHOD(msym, Dynamic) =>
      if (analyzeInc(msym, i, bb)) break
    case _ => ()
  }
  info = tfa.interpret(info, i)
}
{code}
(extempore in [r25234|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25234]) Fixed a bug in the optimizer which was preventing private methods from
being inlined. Also relaxes a condition related to the "liftedTry"
problem: the inliner has to exclude certain methods from consideration
if there is a value on the stack and the method being inlined has
exception handlers. The new condition is as before, except that it does
not exclude methods of the "try/finally" variety (i.e. finalizers, but
no other exception handlers.) This is necessary to optimize this common
pattern:

  @inline private def foo(body: => Unit) {
    val saved = something
    try body
    finally something = saved
  }

The closure for "body" can be fully eliminated, but only if the contents
of foo can be inlined into the caller.

Closes #4764, review by rompf.
