Here's minimal reproduction of the issue:
```scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

abstract class Global {
  final val NoRunId = 14
}

abstract class Foo {
  val global: Global
  val ownPhaseRunId = global.NoRunId
}
new Foo { val global = null }

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

defined class Global
defined class Foo
res0: Foo{val global: Null} = $anon$1@9273085

scala> res0.ownPhaseRunId
res1: Int = 14
```

We inline the constant and thus never refer to global so it doesn't blow up with NPE. What's worse, -Xcheckinit won't help you because it runs after the constant has been inlined and there's no sign of accessing global anymore.
