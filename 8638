To be sure, the issue is that S and T in Fun must be invariant, right? But not in Fun0.
{code}
trait Fun[-S, +T] {type Eval = S => T}

trait Fun0[-S, +T] {
  private[this] type Eval = S => T
}
{code}
I hope this bug is linked in the release notes.
I proposed the following spec update â€” https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/pull/131. It seems the issue was not discussed at all.
