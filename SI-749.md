Just creating this as a reminder that it should be fixed eventually.
Now that there are varargs in trunk, is this still necessary:
```scala
      out.printf(text, args.asInstanceOf[scala.runtime.BoxedObjectArray].
                            unbox(args.getClass).asInstanceOf[Array[Object]])
```
I never would have imagined that this could be considered beautiful, but by comparison...
```scala
    String.format(self, args.toList.toArray[Any].asInstanceOf[Array[AnyRef]]: _*)
```
I'm not sure why it was using reflection until now even in the 1.5 RichString, but I think this version in r17203 doing everything the other one was except tempting cthulu to return.
