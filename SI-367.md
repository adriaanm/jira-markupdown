The compiler will happily compile code using the String �contains� method, even on JDK 1.4 where String does not have that method:

```scala
scala> "foo".contains("foo")
res0: Boolean = false
```

Worse, at runtime it fails by always returning false rather than throwing an exception.
Problem is that because `String` has no `contains` method in 1.4, the `String` is  implicitly converted to a `RichString` which does have a `contains` method, but that method is intended for sequences.  As such calling `contains` in 1.4 means that you are asking if the string contains a given character, which is always false if you give it a `String` instead of a `Char`.  Is giving `RichString` a contains method the correct solution here?
