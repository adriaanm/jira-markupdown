I forgot to mention: I am also using the Scala Maven plugin http://scala-tools.org/mvnsites/maven-scala-plugin so I have a classpath container etc.
When I run

  mvn verify

in the project, my @Test method runs as expected.

(Note, however, that the Scala Eclipse plugin does **not** offer
to run my test as a JUnit test, only as a Scala application)
