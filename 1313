The ambiguity argument is valid -- The code I gave compiles without problems.

The whole request is something that requires a LOT of work. Java never even considered the analogue (statics for inner classes). The EPFL team does not have the resources to do this. If someone wants to do a SIP and an implementation, fine. We'll consider an integration, based on the strengths of the SIP. But it has no place as a ticket.
