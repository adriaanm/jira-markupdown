One of the headline features of Scala is its interoperability with Java. Unfortunately it contrasts with the failure of such a basic operation in Scala as:

class Thing(value: Object); new Thing(1)

throwing the exception:

Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2Integer in object Predef of type (Int)java.lang.Integer
 and method intWrapper in object Predef of type (Int)scala.runtime.RichInt
 are possible conversion functions from Int(1) to java.lang.Object  new Thing(1)

Why there are two implicit converters in Predef package? Isn't it possible (beneficial) to avoid it? It's quite ugly to write new Thing(new java.langInteger(1)), instead of new Thing(1).

Tested in Scala ver.2.7.5.final
This is a duplicate of #496.  And, it's more complicated than it probably seems.
