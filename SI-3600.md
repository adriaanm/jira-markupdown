Scala does not have any way of placing annotations on a package.

In Java, package annotations are placed before the {{package}} statement in a Java source file named {{package-info.java}}. The compiler generates an interface named {{package-info}} and attaches those annotations to it. These annotations (if they have a retention policy of {{RUNTIME}}) can then be looked at with some methods on {{java.lang.Package}}.

The most obvious syntax for this is to allow annotations on package objects. This might result in confusion, though, since package objects have their own, distinct class files.
