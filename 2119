There are three test failures with the modified (or unmodified) patch in effect.
{code}
files/pos/manifest1.scala
files/run/names-defaults.scala
files/jvm/manifests.scala
{code}
Two involve manifests, and one looks like an issue with implicits+defaults where there is no implicit available: the method it's trying to call is:
{code}
  def test9(implicit x: Int = 1, z: String = "klfj") = z + x

// and calling it outputs:
a.scala:216: error: type mismatch;
 found   : <notype>
 required: String
{code}

I put the failure output up here: http://www.improving.org/scala/bug2201-output.txt .  I don't have enough of a handle on this to intuit what else needs to be done.
