= problem =
The packages in most Linux distributions are already outdated at the date of release of those distributions.

Problem is that these Linux distributions think "Newer == less stable" which is not really true at this stage of development.

People who try Scala often end up with these versions (as experienced in Scala's IRC channel).

Additionally it is annoying for nightly testers having to download the newest version (remember to check if new one is available -> look at time stamp -> download -> extract -> rename/fix symlinks -> ...) as tarballs.

= analysis =
Getting distributions to ship with a recent/recommended version will be 

The only real solution would be to provide an APT/RPM repo, which supplies stable/nightly builds, so that people can just add that repo to their package sources.

There are services which help with that. OpenSuse BuildService, Ubuntu PPA, ...

= enhancement recommendation =
Please provide repositories for stable/nightly builds for some of the common Linux distributions. This is comparable to what happens with Maven at the moment.
