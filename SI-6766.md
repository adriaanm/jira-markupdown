we're seeing missing requirement errors for cpsParam when compiling scala reflection in the IDE -- the compiler needs to load the symbol to see whether it occurs in an annotation (even when it turns out it isn't there), and that requires the cpsParam to be on the compilation classpath

it isn't there in the current eclipse setup because the continuations plugin doesn't have a project

proposed fix: add that project and build continuations as part of the eclipse build

this was partly addressed by https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/711, but not fully
