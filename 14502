If you try parsing the following file, parsing fails with an OutOfMemoryError:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<result>
   <title><![CDATA[Truthdig - Cartoons - <b>Iran</b> <b>Election</b> [Revised]]]></title>
</result>


The problem is the "]" at the end of the CDATA. Removing the final "]" makes the file parse fine.

A CDATA segment should end with the first occurrence of "]]>". As such, it should be legal to include a "]" at the end of the CDATA.
