This is a bit of a scala puzzler. The following code compiles and prints "no match" when executed.

{code}
val condition = false
val string = "0123"
val test = if (condition) string else string.drop(1)
test match {
    case "123" => println("match")
    case _ => println("no match")
}
{code}

Here is what happens: string.drop(1) returns a RichString, so the type of val test is inferred to be java.lang.Object. Then the match is performed for an Object, so the first test the program does while matching is the type test, since RichString is clearly not a String, the match fails.

This behaviour is non-intuitive and unexpected. For example, the following code will not compile:
{code}
val string = "0123"
val test = string.drop(1)
test match {
    //type mismatch; found: String("123"), required: RichString
    case "123" => println("match")
    case _ => println("no match")
}
{code}

The problem can be fixed by forcing an implicit conversion from RichString back to String:
{code}
val condition = false
val string = "0123"
val test: String = if (condition) string else string.drop(1)
test match {
    case "123" => println("match")
    case _ => println("no match")
}
{code}
This code compiles and works as expected.

This problem would cause a lot of frustration for people coming from dynamic languages or somebody trying to use scala for scripting.

A clean solution could be to generate a compiler error when there is an upcast to Object when assigning to if. This way, it's clear that object type is different depending on if condition. Then the programmer would be able to specify a commong supertype, or force an implicit conversion to a desired type. For the rare cases when the desired type is Object, specifying the type as Object would make the error go away.

I am submitting this as a defect since it is a rather obscure way of shooting yourself in a foot and is not in the spirit of scala which tries to make the developer's life easier.

The problem that causes (("abc".reverse.reverse) == "abc") == false) is not directly related.

The main issue is letting the type of the variable to be inferred as Object or AnyVal rather than making the programmer specify the type.

Combined with implicit conversions this could lead to all sorts of confusion (the firs example with "123" string).
Here is another example, this time with overloading.

{code}
object Overloaded {
    def f(a: AnyVal) = println("anyval")
    def f(a: Number) = println("number")
    def f(a: Float) = println("float")
}

val condition = true
val test = if (condition) 123 else 123f
Overloaded.f(test)
{code}

The problem here is that the behaviour is not obvious nor intuitive... and most likely not what the developer intended to do. Basically I am trying to argue that the type inference should only work when all the if-branches return the same type. Otherwise the compiler should generate and error and let the programmer specify the type.

Specifying the type would result in either:
- Forcing an implicit conversion and make the program work as intended
- Discovering a type error at compile time rather than having unexpected results at runtime

Another thing worth noting is that most of the time upcasting to Object or AnyVal works. So when it does not work, it is the last place a developer would look at, because it is expected to work. This makes a potent source of hard to find bugs.
