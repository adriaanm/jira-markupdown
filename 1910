(In r20711) Moved some test cases from pending to files since the bugs they
were watching for seem to be fixed.  Moved some other test cases
from pending to disabled because they deceptively claim to pass
while investigation reveals the ticket needs to remain open.
Closes scala/bug#1996, scala/bug#2660.
