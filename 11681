Yep, this is simply not possible to support. The fix for scala/bug#6260 avoids the need for a bridge method in an anoynmous subclass of FunctionN by exactly implementing the interface method. But if you have a named type this isn't possible, as a client of `Id#repr` will expect `repr` to return an unboxed `Id`.
