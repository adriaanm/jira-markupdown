While SI-4473 provides a way of linking to a scaladoc page such that you get the navigation bar plus the desired page, these links are not what you find when you google for Scala APIs. Instead you get links to individual pages (e.g. [http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/Vector$.html] when searching for "scala immutable vector") which provide no obvious way of getting to the full scaladoc page with the navigation bar. There should at least be a link on the page, or possibly an automatic redirection with JavaScript.
