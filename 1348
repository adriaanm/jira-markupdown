Replying to [comment:1 milessabin]:

I followed https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/wiki/EclipsePlugin :
I installed the 2.7.2-final scala plugin (not the nightly) for Eclipse 
and restarted Eclipse (3.4.1 J2EE Ganymede release).

I downloaded the trunk versions of scala, scala-library, and scala-plugin 
via Subclipse. This gave me three Scala projects. The scala project has a .classpath

{{<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src/compiler"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/msil.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/jline.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.pde.core.requiredPlugins"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/fjbg.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="bin"/>
</classpath>

{code}

Thus, the "src/library" directory is not a Source folder in my Java Build Path
for this project; it's "just another file". By "unparented", I mean it
is not in a project source directory.

All three projects have been build successfully; I can launch
the plugin PDE project, etc. However, I'm was not using this PDE project
when I got the error; i.e. this was not from a PDE Launch configuration
in scala-plugin; this error was with the 2.7.2-final plugin.

From here, all I did was navigate in the Package Explorer
to <scala>/src/library/scala/Enumeration.scala and opened
the file. I'll try to attach another screenshot showing the
Eclipse windows including the Package Explorere, Error Log,
and Enumeration.scala Scala editor; Trac does not offer
that on this 'add comment' action.
