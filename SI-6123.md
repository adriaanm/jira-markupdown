With 2.10.0-M5 -explaintypes got much more verbose, compared to (for instance) Scala 2.9.x - it produces extra output even when compilation does not fail.
While this might be done to help debugging, I don't think this is justified even for an intermediate release - debugging stuff should have separate options.

This problem was already briefly discussed on scala-language; Daniel Sobral suggested a bug report.

I found one available - it can be probably reduced further, but it's already just 100 lines. Please don't be confused by the complexity of code, I don't think it's necessary - I selected it from my codebase since it's self-contained and because for most warnings there's just no way to see where they come from, as you'll notice.

Normal output (Scala 2.9.1/.2): empty, as it's supposed to be. In particular, -explaintypes should never produce additional output on correct programs.

With the new release:

I believe that you can take any sufficiently wide codebase of yours, activate -explaintypes and see tons of such warnings arise out of nothing. I had the same problem porting https://github.com/Blaisorblade/BAT to 2.10, even though the code base does not use advanced Scala features as much as mine (as far as I know).
For what it's worth, things got even worse between -M6 and -M7 - output started appearing for
https://github.com/ps-mr/LinqOnSteroids/blob/a2546ff205d56c82baeedfdf02a12043a198386f/scratch/macros/Macros.scala. Sample output (maybe from a slightly different version):

I could try minimizing it if really needed.
Is this *not* planned to be fixed for the whole 2.10 cycle? That's a bit sad.
When Scala-IDE works and I'm patient enough for it (so, a lot of patience), a problem like this becomes easy to fix.

The problems are calls to {{Types.explainTypes}} when {{context.reportErrors}} is false, for instance because they happen during implicit resolution.

{{Types.explainTypes}} should thus check {{reportErrors}} but has no access to {{context}}, and not all calls go through {{Infer.explainTypes}} (although they probably should?), so I have to check {{context.reportErrors}} in multiple locations. Which means that the only reliable way to fix this problem is to add {{-explaintypes}} to scalac flags for all pos tests, and while at it ensure there are neg tests using {{-explaintypes}} and checking that it does produce output.

Pull request for the first part coming up soon.

The first problem is in c800d1fec5241ed8c29e5af30465856f9b583246, in particular in 
{code}
+      def NotWithinBounds(tree: Tree, prefix: String, targs: List[Type],
+                          tparams: List[Symbol], kindErrors: List[String]) = {
+        if (settings.explaintypes.value) {
+          val bounds = tparams map (tp => tp.info.instantiateTypeParams(tparams, targs).bounds)
+          (targs, bounds).zipped foreach ((targ, bound) => explainTypes(bound.lo, targ))
+          (targs, bounds).zipped foreach ((targ, bound) => explainTypes(targ, bound.hi))
+          ()
+        }
+
+        issueNormalTypeError(tree,
+                prefix + "type arguments " + targs.mkString("[", ",", "]") +
+                " do not conform to " + tparams.head.owner + "'s type parameter bounds " +
+                (tparams map (_.defString)).mkString("[", ",", "]"))
+      }
{code}
Testing that -explaintypes works at all requires that partest inspects the standard output of the programs it runs. Hence I'm marking this as blocked by SI-7003.
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2259 is my current fix - the only problem is that it's hard to test correctly, because of limitations/bugs in partest (SI-7003 among others).
