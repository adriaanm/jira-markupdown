The fact that a class extends AnyVal isn't reflected in the class files generated by the compiler:
```scala
class Foo(val bar: Int) extends AnyVal
classOf[Foo].getSuperClass // class java.lang.Object
```

It's important to have a cheap and fast way to recognize value classes at runtime without depending at large, language-specific libraries.
