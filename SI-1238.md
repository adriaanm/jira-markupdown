When I add the Scala nature to a Java Project in Eclipse by right-clicking and selecting Scala => Add Scala Nature everything seems to work fine and I can now mix my .java and .scala class files for compilation.  I can mix my classes across languages.  However, this only seems to work for classes and not for objects.  When I create a standalone object or try to refer to a class companion object with ObjectName$$.MODULE$$ Eclipse is unable to locate the object.  Autocomplete pops up the classes from my .scala files but none of the objects.  If I just type the objects in an error occurs.  I can see the object .class files in the bin directory, but Eclipse just doesnâ€™t see them.

See this thread for more:

This now works when the object is explicitly imported. There are some issues with auto-complete for companion objects, but that is probably a separate bug.

I also filed ticket SI-1729 for a corner-case.
