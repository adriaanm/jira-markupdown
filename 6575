An isInstanceOf test does not check that types have the same enclosing instance.  Here is what it is saying.

{code}
class A { 
  class B
  def f(x: Any) = x.isInstanceOf[B]
  def g(x: Any) = x match { case _: B => true ; case _ => false }
}
val a1 = new A
val a2 = new A
val b2 = new a2.B

scala> a1.f(b2)
res0: Boolean = true

scala> a1.g(b2)
res1: Boolean = false
{code}
