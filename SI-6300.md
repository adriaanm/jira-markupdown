This is an example with Specs2 library. I wasn't able to create standalone example:
{code}
package org.specs2

import org.specs2._
import execute.DecoratedResult
import matcher.{DataTable, DataTables}
import specification.{FragmentsFragment, Fragments, Fragment}

class Test extends Specification with DataTables {
  val result: DecoratedResult[DataTable] = null
//  val fragment: Fragment = dataTableExample(result)
//  val fragments: Fragments = dataTableFragments(result)

  val ff: FragmentsFragment = null
  def is: Fragments = ff ^ result
}
{code}

In FragmentsFragment there are two applicable '\^' methods. One takes Fragment, and another one takes Fragments. DecoratedResult contains implicit conversions to both of this types. Fragment and Fragments are two incompatible types. So this is the place when ambiguity error should be shown. But compiler able to choose '\^' method, which takes Fragment.
There seems to be a conversion Fragment=>Fragments in FragmentBuilder that breaks the tie.

{code}
val fragged: Fragments = null.asInstanceOf[Fragment] // compiles
{code}

Minimized, the situation is:
{code}
class Foo {
  def f(x: Fragment): Unit = { }
  def f(x: Fragments): Unit = { }
}
object Test extends App {
  implicit def a(x: DecoratedResult[DataTable]): Fragment = null
  implicit def b(x: DecoratedResult[DataTable]): Fragments = null
  implicit def c(x: Fragment): Fragments = null
  (new Foo).f(null.asInstanceOf[DecoratedResult[DataTable]])
}
{code}
So a and b make both fs applicable, but c makes the first more specific because the second f applies to (c(_:Fragment)).

I don't know anything about the interesting codebase (though I hope to), so I really could have used more tool support in browsing this issue.  This was too much for me:
-Xlog-implicits -Xlog-implicit-conversions -Ydebug -Yinfer-debug
I just used grep. Also, I kept losing the implicit annotation in Eclipse. The greatest would be to right-click the annotation and see the answer, namely, what implicits are in scope and the overload resolution scorecard between candidates.


Sorry for delayed response.

Examples without specs2 dependency.
{code}
object Minimized {
  class F
  class Fs
  class FF {
    def ^(f: F): Fs = null
    def ^(f: Fs): Fs = null
  }

  class DT
  class DR[+T]
  trait T {
    implicit def dtF[T](x: => DR[T]): F = null
    implicit def dtFs[T](x: => DR[T]): Fs = null
    implicit def f2Fs[T](x: => F): Fs = null //if this line is commented, then compilation will fail
  }

  class S extends T {
    val result: DR[DT] = null

    val ff: FF = null

    def is: Fs = ff ^ result
  }
}
{code}
As A.P.Marki commented, conversion from F to Fs breaks the tie in overloading resolution. SLS 6.23.2 has no words about implicit conversions in resolving overlading. So resolving ^ overloading shouldn't be a reason.
Ok then let's imagine that result can be converted by two possible implicit conversions and we can choose one of them, because one of them is more specific due to implicit conversion from F to Fs, but then following example should be compilable:
{code}
object Minimized {
  class TT
  class F extends TT
  class Fs extends TT
  class FF {
    def ^(f: F): Fs = null
    def ^(f: Fs): Fs = null
  }

  class DT
  class DR[+T]
  trait T {
    implicit def dtF[T](x: => DR[T]): F = null
    implicit def dtFs[T](x: => DR[T]): Fs = null
    implicit def f2Fs[T](x: => F): Fs = null //if this line is commented, then compilation will fail
  }

  class S extends T {
    val result: DR[DT] = null
    val tt: TT = result
  }
}
{code}
This was not-a-bug and shouldn't have a fix version, right?  Apparently, I understood it thoroughly a year and a half ago.
