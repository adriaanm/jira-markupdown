It would have been more fun if it implicated the {{payment}} named arg to {{Invoice}}, since there was a variable and also a package with that name. The possibilities are endless.

I wonder if typelevel scala has come up with a flag to invent names for me. Because when I'm writing a payment system, I'm quickly tapped out.

Or maybe ironic French quotes, {{f(<<i>> = 42)}}, or just {{f('i = 42)}}.
