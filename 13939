How to reproduce:

 1. Enter the Scala perspective and create a New Scala Project & Give it any name
 1. Create a package, "hello", in the newly created project
 1. With package "hello" selected, run File -> New Scala Class and name it "Hello" and give it a main method exactly as follows: 
{code}
package hello

class Hello {
  def main(args:Array[String]) = println("hi world")
}

{code}
 1. Now right-click Hello in the package explorer and select "Run As -> Scala Application" which will fail as expected with a {{ClassNotFoundException}}.
 1. Now change the Hello class to a singleton object by replacing {{class}} with {{object}} so it will look exactly as follows:
{code}
package hello

object Hello {
  def main(args:Array[String]) = println("hi world")
}

{code}
 1. Now Right-Click and select "Run As -> Scala Application" again. This should work but results in {{Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main}}.

Running Project -> Clean will fix the problem but the above behavior is unexpected & confuses noobs like me :)

I was able to reproduce this on my !MacBook and Vista box.
