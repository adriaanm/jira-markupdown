No, I'm on Windows XP and I had JDK 1.5.0_16 installed. Because of the requirements of Scala I installed a JDK 1.6.0_16 and Eclipse 3.5 SR1. When I started Eclipse I got that strange behaviour. I found out that the "standard" JDK was still 1.5 and so Eclipse started up with this JDK. It was pretty odd ... I later deinstalled the 1.5 to make it work, perhaps I could have changed the "standard" JDK for Windows somehow to 1.6!?
