It looks like scala.tools.nsc.Main has problems in general with 
back-slash paths in the Classpath.  So this kind of thing works:
   -classpath "C:/Code/share/WIP/jar/ojdbc6.jar;C:/Code/share/WIP/jar/joda-time-1.6.jar;...

, but this kind of thing fails:
   -classpath "C:\Code\share\WIP\jar\poi-3.2-FINAL-20081019.jar;C:\Code\share\WIP\jar\derby-10.4.2.1.jar;...

I discover the -Ylog-classpath flag - which makes it clear.
I'm trying to find the piece of code to hack so the compiler
can parse the classpath ...
