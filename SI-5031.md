Attached is a three-file reproduction with instructions to reproduce with either scalac or sbt.

The bug persists with `-no-specialization`; and appears in at least 2.8.1 and 2.9.1.

Workaround is to choose a different name for the object.

Then, it works well to define a value alias?
```scala
package scalaz {
   val Id = Ident
}
```
In 2.10 it says the following:
```
[error] /repo/scala-issues-dev/tickets/5031/src/main/scala/npe/Id.scala:9: Companions 'type ID' and 'object ID' must be defined in same file:
[error]   Found in /repo/scala-issues-dev/tickets/5031/src/main/scala/npe/package.scala and /repo/scala-issues-dev/tickets/5031/src/main/scala/npe/Id.scala
[error] object ID extends IDs 
[error]        ^
```
Which sounds like the right error to me, although at a glance the spec doesn't say much about the companionship of type aliases.  If I do that, it compiles fine:
```scala
package object npe {
	
	type ID = Int
}

package npe {

  trait N[X]

  trait IDs {
  	val id = new N[ID] {}
  }

  object ID extends IDs 
}
```
Going to call this fixed, reopen if you disagree.
See also #5422 (marked as duplicate), which contains a program that compiled with 2.9.1 that no longer compiles.
"Type aliases can't have companion objects" unfortunately doesn't clarify much for whomever may attempt this.  The precise behavior and relationship of a type alias and a value of the same name, compiled separately or together, is what is at issue, especially if the type alias is defined in a package object.  Also at issue is the feasibility of implementation: it is undesirable to have prohibitions which we cannot or will not recognize at compile time and which manifest as mysterious errors.

I know you don't mean "type aliases can't share a name with a term" because that would break the standard library in a hundred places.  So I take it you mean "type aliases and terms of the same name have no special relationship."
I admit I don't remember much in the way of details, but because package objects are opened up very early, they tend to offer special challenges.  I think the difficulties, should any exist, will make themselves apparent - at which point I will have a better chance of elaborating.
I just ran into this as well when porting my code from 2.9.2 to 2.10.0(-M5), so I realized it's a regression. Is it going to be fixed for 2.10.0? If so, shouldn't this be reprioritized as critical to ensure that it's actually fixed before release? #5031 is currently marked as minor.

I'm currently modifying my source (and others') to workaround this, but I'd like to understand if this is going to be fixed before 2.10 or not - if it's going to be fixed, then I could undo the changes or not push them.
Thanks a lot! I think confusion has arisen because the *original* bug report was about something else for 2.8.1 and 2.9.1, while Paul Phillips's comment switched the discussion to the regression. It might be worth preserving the original bug report.
But at least, the *regression* won't be forgot.
Here is the minimized code from the zip file that illustrates the regression.
Id.scala:
```scala
package t5031
object ID
```

package.scala:
```scala
package object t5031 {
  type ID = Int
}
```
