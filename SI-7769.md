This code fails to compile

{code}
class Foo { class Inner(x: Int = 42) }
class Bar extends Foo { class Inner(y: Int = 0) extends super.Inner() }
{code}

with the error message

{code}
scalatest.scala:2: error: overriding object Inner in class Foo;
 object Inner cannot override final member
class Bar extends Foo { class Inner(y: Int = 0) extends super.Inner() }
                              ^
one error found
{code}

This is a bit misleading if you didn't expect the object Inner to be created, particularly as it only refuses to compile if the companion object needs to be created (e.g. when there are default parameters).

A more explanatory error message would probably suffice for now...
Workaround suggested by @szeiger:

{code}
class Foo { class Inner(x: Int){ def this() = this(42) } }
class Bar extends Foo { class Inner(y: Int = 0) extends super.Inner() }
{code}
