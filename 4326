Well, perhaps it is different enough to be a separate ticket.  With the attached patch:
```scala
scala> <sometag>{3}</sometag>   
res1: scala.xml.Elem = <sometag>3</sometag>

scala> <sometag>{new Xmlable(3)}</sometag>
res2: scala.xml.Elem = <sometag>i = 3</sometag>
```

In theory it should be source compatible (test suite passes), but I'm sure it breaks someone's code somewhere. 

scala/bug#1787 requires a more invasive approach since type parameters aren't allowed on auxiliary constructors.
