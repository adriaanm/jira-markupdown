Thanks for filling in the history. I guess the backend can't really warn about stupid casts as the compiler can generate them (ie through specialization).

We could certainly warn about them in the type checker. I think the idea has come up before, but the usual answer is that if you want the warnings, you should use a pattern match, rather than an `isInstanceOf`.

Another approach, albeit less generally useful, would be to avoid emitting the {{if (x eq null)}} in the {{isInstanceOf}} translation I added to {{Erasure}} if the {{x}} is trivially known to be non-null.
