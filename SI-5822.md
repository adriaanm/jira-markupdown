OSGi manifest entries should be added to the jars (such as scala-library) so they may be used as OSGi bundles.

The ScalaIDE project distributes an OSGi bundle, but it isn't ideal for all use cases. For example, it only appears to be available from p2 repositories, which makes it difficult to use in projects unrelated to Eclipse. It also contains all the scala jars, which adds significant footprint.

Assigning to Josh at his request.
Scala-compiler as an OSGi bundle is important to us to compile Scalate templates inside an OSGi environment. FYI for those looking for good maven accessible OSGi artifacts for 2.9.x, the ServiceMix bundles project wraps them and works well for both scala-compiler and scala-library -- they recently added 2.9.2 as well (untested by me so far, though I'd already built my own 2.9.2 bundles using their 2.9.1 recipe):

https://github.com/apache/servicemix4-bundles/tree/trunk/scala-library-2.9.2

These servicemix artifacts are all available in maven public repos:
