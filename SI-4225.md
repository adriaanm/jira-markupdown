=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
```scala
trait Foo {
 val name : String
 trait Bar {
   def doSomething : String
   override def toString = "Foo(" + name + ").Bar -> " + doSomething
 }
 object Bar {
   implicit def fromFunction(func : Function0[String]) = new Bar {
     def doSomething = func()
   }
 }
 def andThen(b : Bar) = b
}

object Foo {
  def foo(n : String) = new Foo {
    override val name = n
  }
}
```

And then run in the REPL

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

I expect the implicit lookup to succeed in finding an implicit view for foo.Bar.

=== What do you see instead? ===

With trunk, this does not fail, and reports a type mismatch instead:

```scala
scala> Foo.foo("foo") andThen (() => "Bar")
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : () => java.lang.String
 required: _1.Bar where val _1: java.lang.Object with Foo
       Foo.foo("foo") andThen (() => "Bar"
```

It was stated on the meeting that the implicit should not be triggered. Perhaps I'm missing something with this ticket, but I do not think so - according to the spec:

```scala
7.3 Views
...
Views are applied in two situations:
1. If an expression e is of type T , and T does not conform to the expression’s
expected type pt. In this case an implicit v is searched which is applicable to
e and whose result type conforms to pt. The search proceeds as in the case of
implicit parameters, where the implicit scope is the one of T => pt. If such a
view is found, the expression e is converted to v (e ).
```

In our case, the `T => pt` is `Function0[String] => _1.Bar`, that is `Function1[Function0[String], _1.Bar]`, where `_1: Foo`. Now, in section on implicit parameters, about how the search proceeds:

```scala
The implicit scope of a type T consists of all companion modules (�5.4) of classes
that are associated with the implicit parameter’s type. Here, we say a class C is asso-
ciated with a type T , if it is a base class (�5.1.2) of some part of T . The parts of a type
T are:
...
* if T is a parameterized type S [T1 , . . . , Tn ], the union of the parts of S and
T1 , . . . , Tn ,
...
```

The implicit scope `T` above is `Function1[Function0[String], _1.Bar]`, so `T2 = _1.Bar`, making its companion module eligible for the implicit search.

I've shown this and talked to two more people from the lab, and they think this should be put back to the meeting.
I'm having a look, but in the meantime -- work around, don't make the compiler invent an existential for the `Foo` created by `Foo.foo("foo")`:

```scala
trait Foo {
 val name : String
 trait Bar {
   def doSomething : String
   override def toString = "Foo(" + name + ").Bar -> " + doSomething
 }
 object Bar {
   implicit def fromFunction(func : Function0[String]) = new Bar {
     def doSomething = func()
   }
 }
 def andThen(b : Bar) = b
}

object Foo {
  def foo(n : String) = new Foo {
    override val name = n
  }
}

object Test {
   val f = Foo.foo("foo") 
   f andThen (() => "Bar")
}
```
simplified test case (it's also probably more of a problem with existentials rather than implicits)

```scala
class Foo {
  class Bar
  object Bar {
    implicit def fromString(a: String) = new Bar
  }
  def andThen(b : Bar) = b
}

object Test {
  (new Foo) andThen ("Bar")
}
```
the compiler certainly shouldn't crash, but I don't think it's feasible to make this work

the problem is that the target of the andThen call is not stable, and thus, nor is the expected type of andThen's argument. In the "val f" variant above, the type of the argument is f.Bar, but in the original example it's `X.Bar forSome {val X : Foo}`

before the search for the implicit conversion that converts "Bar" into a suitable argument for andThen has even begun, it is doomed: since we've essentially opened the existential in the expected type, but not in the return type of the fromFunction implicit, those types have become hopelessly incompatible. fromFunction's return type must now be thought of as `Y.Bar forSome {val Y : Foo}` (renaming only for emphasis), which is not compatible with `X.Bar forSome {val X : Foo}`

conceptually, it would be reasonable to expect the skolems (existentials that have been opened) X and Y in X.Bar (expected type of andThen's argument) and Y.Bar (return type of the fromFunction implicit) to refer to the same "value", and thus for the type selections to refer to the same type, but this is not how it's implemented (and I'm pretty sure it would be hard to change that)

If stable id is ok, this should compile..?
For some reason, type annotation is needed. (In 2.9.1.RC3 and some 2.10.0-SNAPSHOT)

```scala
class DependentImplicitTezt {

    trait Bridge

    class Outer {
        class Inner extends Bridge

        object Inner {
            implicit def fromOther(b: Bridge): Inner = throw new Error("todo")
        }

        def run(x: Inner) = throw new Error("todo")
    }

    val o1 = new Outer
    val o2 = new Outer
    val i1 = new o1.Inner
    val i2 = new o2.Inner

    def doesntCompile {
        o1.run(i2) // no
    }

    def workaround1 {
        o1.run(i2: Bridge) // ok
    }

    def workaround2 {
        import o1.Inner.fromOther
        o1.run(i2) // ok
    }
}
```
With the universes and path-dependence running around in reflection, I think this has become a significantly larger problem.  I ran into it immediately:
```scala
object Test {
  implicit class Ops(val g: scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse) {
    def op[T: g.TypeTag] = ()
  }
  
  scala.reflect.runtime.universe.op[Int]
}
```
```

// uncaught exception during compilation: java.lang.AssertionError
// error: java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: mkAttributedQualifier(_1.type, <none>)//
//
// at scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:162)
// at scala.reflect.internal.TreeGen.mkAttributedQualifier(TreeGen.scala:87)
// at scala.reflect.internal.TreeGen.mkAttributedQualifier(TreeGen.scala:60)

// at scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.Implicits$ImplicitSearch.bestImplicit(Implicits.scala:1373)
```
That's not going through a normal implicit search; it's a type tag specific code path.

```scala
  // [Eugene to Martin] this is the crux of the interaction between
  // implicits and reifiers here we need to turn a (supposedly
  // path-dependent) type into a tree that will be used as a prefix I'm
  // not sure if I've done this right - please, review
  case SingleType(prePre, preSym) =>
    gen.mkAttributedRef(prePre, preSym) setType pre
```
I haven't thought this through fully, but this looks like a workaround:

```scala
object Test {
  class Ops[U <: scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse](val g: U) {
    def op[T: U#TypeTag] = ()
  }
  implicit def Ops(g: scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse): Ops[g.type] = new Ops(g)
  Ops(scala.reflect.runtime.universe).op[Int]
  scala.reflect.runtime.universe.op[Int]
}
```
Extracted the typeTag crasher to #5946
