```scala
class MyList[A] {
  def head: A = error("")
  def prepend(x: A): MyList[A] = error("")
}

object IntList extends MyList[Int]
```

Static method 'head', added in class `IntList` will have the signature `()TA;`. It should be `()I`, since the type of `head` as a member of `IntList` is `()Int`.

You can test using the following Java program.
```scala
class Foo {
    public int foo() {
        IntList xs = null;
        return xs.head;
    }
}
```
