As a complement, the following piece of code fails too:
```scala
val a: A = new A() append "hello"
println(a.current)

val b: B = a append " you!"
println(b.current)
```

while this one doesn't:
```scala

val a: A = new A() append "hello"
println(a.current)

val b = a append " you!"
println(b.current)
```
