in Scala 2.10.2, this warns me about a non-exhaustive pattern match...
```scala
sealed trait Test
case class TestA() extends Test
case class TestB() extends Test

object Tester {
  val input : Test = TestA()
  val x = input match {
    case TestA() => 2
  }
}

// But this does not:

object Tester {
  val input : Test = TestA()
  val num = 3
  val x = input match {
    case TestA() if num == 3 => 2
  }
}
```
The compiler should be able to determine that a guard clause cannot increase exhaustivity.  While I can accept the decision not to make the exhaustivity search be pessimistic (which could result in some false warnings, if something always evaluates to true for some reason), it should at least be able to determine that the case of TestB() is not handled.
It seems reasonable that we should always perform exhaustiveness checking and simply ignore guards so we can report types which are definitely not covered. It's not ideal that there's no indication that exhaustiveness checking is not being performed if you add a guard somewhere; I don't think there's anything to be done about that though, as it would be super noisy to do so.

Actually like a lot of things, the useful warning would be issued at the point when you **change** the code, not as a consequence of the code when considered in isolation. ("Warning: the guard you just added disabled exhaustiveness checking.") That of course is not something which can be done in the compiler given present abilities.
(This looks like a duplicate of #5365 (closed). I agree that the compiler should not treat guard clauses as "always true" for the purposes of exhaustivity checking. This causes lots of problems. See my detailed comments on #5365.)
Merging with #5365.
