That does seem much better; thanks very much for pointing it out.  I hope to be able to use it as a standard part of my 2.11.x compilation options.

I've found scala/bug#7990 and scala/bug#7991 in some initial experiments, though.  I tried to build scalaz-seven core head against M7 with that option, and I believe scala/bug#7991 would fix almost all of the resulting errors, if not all.

I also imagine Paul C would prefer scala/bug#7990 just be an error right out.
