The first of the following objects does not warn of an unused import even, while the second one does. It seems to be related to the use of the `StringOps.contains` as opposed to `String.contains`.

This issue (or a very similar one) has also been posted to the [scala-user mailing line](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/scala-user/m5XY7yulkHI/kFMlsa5eM9gJ), but did not receive a response.

```
package a

import java.io.File

object FailCase {
  def test: Boolean = "0".contains('0')
}
// compile with `scalac -Ywarn-unused-import path/to/FailCase.scala`
// you will see no warnings
```

```
package a

import java.io.File

object SuccessCase {
  def test: Boolean = "0".contains("0")
}
// compile with `scalac -Ywarn-unused-import path/to/SuccessCase.scala`
// you will get:
// path/toSuccessCase.scala:5: warning: Unused import
// import java.io.File
//               ^
// one warning found
```

Implicit search left fingerprints on imports even if they weren't used for the winning implicit.
