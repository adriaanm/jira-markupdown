Absolutely sorry about that I had forgotten how I build this project.  I realized what I had done after I went to bed and it was too late to update the ticket (kids don't let me escape to the computer too often)

It is still mostly private and I install the scala 2.8 artifact myself locally.  I will quickly make a stand alone project that you can compile by hand.  

I will update this ticket as soon as I have it online.

I will spend a couple hours now trying to reduce the scope of the project down to just the classes that cause the problem.
