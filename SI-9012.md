In bytecode both methods {{bar}} have the same signature but for the return-type. The call to {{bar(null)}} is statically dispatched to the wrong method if the target method is defined in the superclass.

Discovered by [~sirthias].
That's quite interesting because bar(null) should NEVER call the Blub-defined method. And indeed if that's the only bar in existence, it doesn't compile at all.

This is what happens when there is no distinction maintained between the code that you actually wrote vs. the end result of the many meaningless-to-the-programmer transformations which take place on the way to the bytecode.
