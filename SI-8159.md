Given the following code:

{code}
    object SomeOddThing extends App {
      val c: C = new C
      val a: A = c
      val b: B = c
      // these will all print None
      println(a.x)
      println(b.x)
      println(c.x)
    }

    abstract class A {
      def x: Option[String] = None
    }

    abstract class B extends A {
      override def x: Option[String] = Some("xyz")
    }

    // this shouldn't compile!
    class C extends B {
      // x now has type None.type instead of Option[String]
      override def x = None
    }

    trait T {
      this: B =>
      override def x = Some("ttt")
    }

    // and this won't compile with the following error
    // error: overriding method x in class C of type => None.type;
    //  method x in trait T of type => Some[String] has incompatible type
    // class D extends C with T {}
    //       ^
    class D extends C with T {}
{code}

The compiler seems to infer the type of C.x as None.type so D doesn't compile.

I thought I saw a ticket after that.  (SI-7212)

The issue should be an improvement since, according to SO, "The spec 4.6.4 only promises to infer a conforming type for the result type of the overriding method."

http://stackoverflow.com/a/21198284/1296806

The distinction is between "Scala is buggy" and "Scala is greatly improved."

I finally get it. I wasn't thinking about the fact that the return type can change covariantly. What should the rule be though? Should a subtype method have as return type the first explicitly declared type in the class hierarchy? Meaning, the following should be possible:

{code}
class A{
  def x: Option[String] = None
}

class B extends A{
  override def x: None = None
}

// should NOT compile
class C extends B{
  override def x = Some("123")
}

class D extends A{
  override def x = None
}

// should compile
class E extends D{
  override def x = Some("123")
}
{code}

Am I right?
I think the first question was s/should/ought, if the proposed rule was in effect and made it work intuitively.

But the Scala way is to have intuitive rules with unintuitive edge cases, not the other way around!  Otherwise, there would be no puzzlers.

The reason I thought I saw a ticket is that I created one: SI-7873

See SI-7212
