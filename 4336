Just wanted to point out because I'm so happy about it that as of r23238 the error message has changed from:
{code}
Exception in thread "main" scala.MatchError?: ?>: Nothing <: Any 
{code}
to:
{code}
Exception in thread "main" scala.MatchError: ?>: Nothing <: Any (of class scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$BoundedWildcardType)
{code}
I'm already planning a lengthy vacation with all the time saved.
