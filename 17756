Following pattern match:

{code}
scala> import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._
import scala.reflect.runtime.universe._

scala> Flag.IMPLICIT match { case f: FlagSet => "flag"; case l: Long => "long" }
warning: there were 1 unchecked warnings; re-run with -unchecked for details
res2: String = long
{code}

Should return "flag". Class tag (FlagSetTag) is imported and in scope so it looks like pattern matching bug.
