Hello,

Sorry for the long and meaningless summary.

I am using scala 2.7.3 final and the following looks like a bug to me, but maybe I am using too experimental features ... :
{code}
object Types {
  type QuasiC = {val valInC: Types.QuasiA}
  type QuasiA = {def methodInA: String}
}

abstract class A {
  this: Types.QuasiA =>
  //def methodInA: String // with this instead it works
}
class B(aType: Types.QuasiC)

// C should be QuasiC !
abstract class C {
  val valInC: A

  def testm {
    new B(this)
  }
}
{code}

gives this error :
{code}
test2.scala:19: error: type mismatch;
 found   : test2.C
 required: test2.Types.QuasiC
    new B(this)
          ^
one error found
{code}

If I am not mistaken, to call testM on a C, C will not be abstract, so valInC will have a value, that will be of class A, which should not be abstract, so mixed in with something that provides methodInA, and so C will be conform to QuasiC !
Giving A the self-type of Types.QuasiA does not imply that something of type A is also a Types.QuasiA.  See also SI-1063.
