what is this "feature" and how do we turn it off? We have a warning intolerant build and use this kind of thing for instance [using the Typesafe Config library](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/kadai/src/ed11665c6e0e7bdfe1b269c87261428e41a2eea5/config/src/test/scala/kadai/config/ConfigurationSpec.scala?at=master#cl-88).

Is there a macro that performs no interpolation and avoids this warning?
