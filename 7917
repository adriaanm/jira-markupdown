The boat I'm in is a lot more like the boat you're in than you probably think.  I'm no longer willing to spend time on this sort of issue because it's nothing but blank walls, dead ends, and stairways to nowhere.  If you have an idea how to see some kind of progress you should pursue it, because that idea already puts you ahead of me.
