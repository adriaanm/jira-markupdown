The spec seems relatively clear on this point

Bindings:
>A reference to an unqualified (type- or term-) identifier x is bound by the unique
>binding, which a) defines an entity with name x in the same namespace as the identifier, and b) shadows all other bindings that define entities with name x in that namespace.
>
> It is an error if no such binding exists.

Views
> are applied .... in a selection e.m with e of type T , if the select or m does not denote a member of T
