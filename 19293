https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5439c4c introduced an IllegalArgumentException for CannotHaveAttrs, and a test (assertThrows).

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/351a3e0d changed the exception to a log, without changing the test.

This went unnoticed because of a bug in assertThrows: if the expression does not throw at all, it would pass.

See here for the fix in `assertThrows`, it's not yet merged, but under review: https://github.com/lrytz/scala/commit/3fea08e786af8944652d1dbf853891ced4848c07
