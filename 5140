Looking at this again (because I'm neurotic), it seems that the behavior of the `+` operation is _not_ "the same regardless of whether the left operand is typed as String", because StringAdd's `+` method takes a `String` argument rather than an `Any`. If you change the spec as I suggested in my previous comment, this will have to be changed as well.
