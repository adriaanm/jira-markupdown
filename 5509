Actually, this does not throw an exception per se. Only when the field is actually accessed does it throw an exception:
```scala
scala> class A[T] {
     |   var elem: T = _
     | }            
defined class A                                                                                                            
scala> new A        
res0: A[Nothing] = A@391b0c           
                
scala> (new A).elem
java.lang.NullPointerException

scala> class B {
     |   var elem: Nothing = _
     | }
defined class B

scala> new B
res2: B = B@e79eb3
```

In the repl, the field is accessed in order to be written, that's why an exception occurs. Perhaps the spec should say what happens when accessing such a value (which particular exception is thrown).
