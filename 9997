To continue the escaping stability side-discussion, I will say that what you've said here and on SI-8223, I'm convinced not only that the stability _can_ safely escape the scope, but that it would be a problem if it didn't. Obviously, the current implementation is still slightly "wrong", but at this time it doesn't seem all that pressing to fix it.
