The following quotation is sentences in the page 23 of "Scala by Examples - December 19, 2007"


{code}
Indeed, the anonymous function

(x1: T1, ..., xn: Tn) => E

is equivalent to the block

{ def f (x1: T1, ..., xn: Tn) = E ; f }

where f is fresh name which is used nowhere else in the program.
We also say, anonymous functions are “syntactic sugar”.
{code}

But { def f (x1: T1, ..., xn: Tn) = E ; f } should be changed as { def f (x1: T1, ..., xn: Tn) = E ; f _}

The following is concrete example for the statement.


{code}
scala> {def f(x: Int) = x * x; f _}
res3: (Int) => Int = <function>

scala> {def f(x: Int) = x * x; f}
<console>:5: error: missing arguments for method f;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
       {def f(x: Int) = x * x; f}
{code}
