Given the following files:

```scala
// Base.java
public class Base {
  public boolean foo() { return true; }
}

// Abstract.java
public abstract class Abstract extends Base {
  public abstract boolean foo(); // force re-implementation in derived classes
}

// DerivedJava.java
public class DerivedJava extends Abstract {}

// DerivedScala.scala
class DerivedScala extends Abstract

// Main.scala
object Main extends App {
  new DerivedScala().foo()
}
```

WIth these present, javac will fail to compile DerivedJava, complaining that foo needs to be defined. However, scalac will not fail to compile DerivedScala.scala, and when Main.scala is compiled and run, it crashes with AbstractMethodError (shown here from the REPL):

```scala
scala> class Derived extends Abstract
defined class Derived

scala> new Derived().foo()
java.lang.AbstractMethodError: Derived.foo()Z

Jason, maybe you could apply some of the same sauce as with #4989
Class `DerivedScala` extends the abstract class `Abstract`. I expected that the compiler flags an error on class `DerivedScala`, as its base class contains a deferred definition of a method, similarly to
```scala
scala> class A {def foo = 0 }
defined class A

scala> abstract class B extends A { def foo: Int }
defined class B

scala> class C extends B
<console>:9: error: class C needs to be abstract, since there is a deferred decl
aration of method foo in class B of type => Int which is not implemented in a su
bclass
       class C extends B
             ^
```
Dominik,

I understand that in order to compile successfully that DerivedJava must be declared abstract. The DerivedJava class is there to demonstrate an **expected** compilation failure. The description doesn't make sense if DeclaredJava compiles, so I have returned the description to its original state. The class is not "used" except as an example of where javac should (and does) fail to compile.

The compiler does **not** flag an error on DerivedScala, which is the point of the bug report.

May I ask why? This seems a pretty obscure bug that wouldn't really be a blocker.

The policy, given limited resources, is to only backport if the interested party either:

 1. does the leg-work to cherry-pick the commit to the 2.9.x branch and checks that the test suite passes, and submits a pull request, or
 2. has a support contract with TypeSafe.

It's also not clear if there will be a 2.9.3 release at all.
No, it's not a blocker, though it is a bug generator, as a Java dependency of a Scala project I maintain added a new abstract method in a version upgrade; not having the compiler fail created a latent bug at runtime.

I understand there may not be a 2.9.3, but if there **is** I would predict it will before 2.10, and have less impact to development (and more importantly, my end users) than a 2.10 upgrade.

I'll take a look at doing the cherry-pick legwork, in the hopes that a 2.9.3 release happens. Thanks again for the quick fix.
