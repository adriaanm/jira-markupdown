Ant build target runs successfully.  Subsequently ran the 'dist' target which fails when running dependent target 'docs.lib'.  In docs.lib the root problem was the scaladoc command.

The error message complains that "Attribute 'srcdir' is not set."  However the scaladoc documentation says this should not be a problem if the command includes nested <src> elements (which it does).

output from 'dist' target:
