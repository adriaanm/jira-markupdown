With 2.7.2-final this works ok (Linux):

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.2.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_07).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("sample_file.txt").getLines.foldLeft("")(_ + _)          
res0: java.lang.String = 
���


scala>
{code}

but with 2.7.3.RC1 and exactly the same file, this hangs with 100% processor utilization:

{code}

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("sample_file.txt").getLines.foldLeft("")(_ + _)

It looks like the hang only occurs if file contains extended characters. Sample file is attached.
