I don't know which project(s) cause the build to fail. Check codadris.dbgui - it is problematic for sure. [[BR]]
codadris.utils , on the other hand has little dependencies on other projects.
All projects reside in [[BR]]
/home/karolrvn/adfadf/programming/verknowsys/codadris/ide_projects [[BR]]
the workspace is in [[BR]]
/home/karolrvn/adfadf/programming/eclipse/workspace [[BR]]

So the projects are completely external to the workspace, i guess.
Linked source folders? That sounds like a franken-something. I think we don't have any of these.
I have project folders imported to eclipse workspace (without copying contents), though.
Oh. The .project / .classpath files may have scala builder removed because i tried whether pure maven would at least compile.

Anything else I can do to help?
