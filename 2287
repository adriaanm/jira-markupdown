Very sorry nobody has responded to you on this; the problem is that martin is almost the only person who can properly assess a patch in this area, and he is buried.  I am promoting myself to basically-capable-of-assessing and will take a look at all this right now.

On a separate note, thank you very much for your work on scala/bug#2337, which is definitely scala/bug#1697.  I already had that fairly specifically diagnosed, but fixing it has been far more elusive than it ought to be because of the opaque way the pattern matcher constructs its automaton.  Regardless, another pair of eyes on these bugs is tremendously useful, and test cases and actual patches puts you in a seriously elite group -- so please don't be discouraged by the difficulty (unusually high right now with 2.8 around the corner) of getting the attention of committers.
