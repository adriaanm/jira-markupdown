I'm happy to take your word for that, but does this mean the shortest way to write this is to be:
```scala
Map[t1, t2]#Inner forSome { type t1 ; type t2; }
```
If Map[_,_]#Inner is a parse error and the alternative is the above, then at the very least we'd better suggest it in the error message.  It is regrettable to impose such a steep syntax penalty: type projections are already unwieldy.
