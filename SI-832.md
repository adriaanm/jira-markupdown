ATM, there's no way to annotate anonymous classes:

```scala
trait foo { def xy: Int }

val x = new @serializable @SerialVersionUID(1L) foo { def xy = 2 }
```

Since @SerialVersionUID is the only (official) way to add a static field SerialVersionUID to classes, this should somehow be made possible.

As from the mailing list, this also doesn't work as well:

```scala
val x = new foo @serializable @SerialVersionUID(1L) { def xy = 2 }
```

Any way to achieve this?

Allowing annotating anonymous classes requires changing the Scala syntax, which is considered a rather big change.

Since one can always work around it by creating a named class, this won't be added in order to keep the language simpler.

```scala
@serializable @SerialVersionUID(1L) class foo1 { def xy = 2 }
val x = new foo1
```
