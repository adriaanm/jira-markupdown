I tried to use the arrow keys in scala but it displays Chinese characters. The below are the output of pressing up, down, left right. I am in Windows English input mode when this happens.

I am having a very similar problem...Arrow keys are not working in REPL. Getting characters. Not chinese ones :o), but different ones. For example getting {{ÓH}} for 'up' arrow, {{ÓK}} for 'left' arrow.
The CTRL+P, etc. shortcuts do work.

My environment:
Scala: 2.11.0
Windows: 8.1 Update 1, English
Windows locale settings: Slovak


Looks like this is fixed upstream: https://github.com/jline/jline2/pull/134
We should upgrade to the jline with that fix, filing a separate issue for that.
