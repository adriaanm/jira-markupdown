> Key question: When does the symbol for method B#a lose the DEFERRED flag?

It doesn't.  When you request the member of B called a, you get the symbol defined in A, not in B, because concrete always overrides abstract.  If you want B#a, use decl (or I guess it's called declaration in the library.)
