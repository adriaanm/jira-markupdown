The {{take}} and {{drop}} methods of iterators of type {{IndexedSeqLike#Elements}} to not advance the iterators and also ignore the iterators current state. {{IndexedSeqLike#Elements}} it used by IndexedSeq.iterator and others. 

REPL Transscript (with current nightly build):
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r21946-b20100517020056 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).

scala> val it = (1 to 12).toSeq.iterator 
it: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> it.next
res0: Int = 1

scala> it.take(2).toList
res1: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> it.takeWhile(_ < 6).toList
res2: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4, 5)

scala> it.next
res3: Int = 7

scala> val d = it.drop(2)
d: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> d == it
res4: Boolean = false

scala> it.next
res5: Int = 8

scala> it.take(2).toList
res6: List[Int] = List(1, 2)
{code}


Whereas with other iterators (e.g. List.iterator):

{code}
scala> val it = (1 to 12).toList.iterator
it: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> it.next
res0: Int = 1

scala> it.take(2).toList
res1: List[Int] = List(2, 3)

scala> it.takeWhile(_ < 6).toList
res2: List[Int] = List(4, 5)

scala> it.next
res3: Int = 7

scala> val d = it.drop(2)
d: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> d == it
res4: Boolean = true

scala> it.next
res5: Int = 10

scala> it.take(2).toList
res6: List[Int] = List(11, 12)
{code}

With {{Map}} the behaviour of Map.iterator depends on the size of the Map, since Map uses different implementations for different sizes, for small Maps IndexedSeqLike#Elements is used.


Cause:

The implementation of IndexedSeqLike#Elements looks like this:

{code}
  protected class Elements(start: Int, end: Int) extends BufferedIterator[A] {
    private var i = start

    def hasNext: Boolean = i < end

    def next: A = 
      if (i < end) {
        val x = self(i)
        i += 1
        x
      } else Iterator.empty.next

    [...]

    override def drop(n: Int): Iterator[A] =
      if (n > 0) new Elements(start + n, end) else this

    override def take(n: Int): Iterator[A] =
      if (n <= 0) Iterator.empty.buffered
      else if (start + n < end) new Elements(start, start + n) 
      else this
  }
{code}

So while {{hasNext}} and {{next}} use {{var i}}, the optimized versions of {{drop}} and {{take}} use {{start}} instead, ignoring and not advancing the current state.

I believe we should have something like

{code}
    override def drop(n: Int): Iterator[A] = {
      if (n > 0) i = math.min(i + n, end)
      this
    }
 
    override def take(n: Int): Iterator[A] = {
      if ((n <= 0) || !hasNext) Iterator.empty.buffered
      else {
        val from = i
        i = math.min(i + n, end)
        new Elements(from, i)
      }
    }
{code}

in there.

Ok, I did a bit more testing - Iterator.{{take}}, for example, does not advance the iterator for lists either until the resulting iterator is actually used, while {{drop}} does.

Is the state of an Iterator after take, drop, takeWhile, dropWhile, etc. undefined? If so, close this bug, but it should added to the the documentation.

This wasn't precisely documented anywhere, but in my opinion, once you've called a certain transformer method on an iterator (which may produce another iterator, like `take` or `drop`) it's state should be undefined - the original iterator shouldn't be used anymore.

However, `next` should not invalidate the iterator's state, so this:

{code}
scala> val it = (1 to 12).toSeq.iterator 
it: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> it.next
res0: Int = 1

scala> it.take(2).toList
res1: List[Int] = List(1, 2)
{code}

is a bug which has to do with `take` and `drop` in `IndexedSeqLike#Elements`. Once the iterator progresses to the next element, it should `take` only its remaining elements.

I can fix this.



New behaviour will be:

scala> it.takeWhile(_ < 6).toList

scala> it.next

scala> it.drop(2)

scala> val d = it.drop(2)
d: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> d == it
res6: Boolean = false

scala> it.next
res7: Int = 8

scala> it.take(2).toList
res8: List[Int] = List(9, 10)                                                                                                                                                    
{code}


Note that this is not exactly the same as with the list iterator, but this is due to the `it` being consumed by the `take` - `it` shouldn't be used afterwards.

To backup this claim, implementation of `drop` in `Iterator`:

{code}
  def drop(n: Int): Iterator[A] = {
    @tailrec
    def loop(left: Int): Iterator[A] =
      if (left > 0 && hasNext) { next; loop(left - 1) }
      else this
    
    loop(n)
  }
{code}

means there are other places where it's assumed that the original iterator shouldn't be used anymore after invoking a transformer, since the result may alias the old iterator.
