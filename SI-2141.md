I am writing a transformer/compiler plug-in and there is obviously a lot of pattern matching involved. I'm using Scala 2.7.5. I happened upon this case where a pattern is not matching in some situations.

When used in the transform(Tree):Tree method of a transformer, this case won't match:

case SCreator(x,y,List(z1,z2)) => tree

But this will:

case Apply(Select(a, b), List(c,d)) =>
  tree match {
    case SCreator(x,y,List(z1,z2)) => tree
    case _ => tree
  }

What could be the difference?

SCreator is defined like this:

object SCreator {
  def unapply(tr: Tree) = tr match {
    case Apply(Select(ScalarizableObject(sc), name), args) 
      if sc.creators contains name => Some(sc, name, args)
    case _ => None
  }
}
A nested case class inside an extractor? #1697 comes to mind first.  Sorry, there are significant bugs in the matcher.  It's what I'm working on right now to the exclusion of most other things, and I expect to close every pattern matcher bug before 2.8 is out.
