Hi,

I managed to get Scala compiler to emit stack trace twice when I started to learn how to do testing in Lift. Attached is the minimum Lift-project that contains both of the problems. Stack traces are also attached.

I'm using scala 2.7.2 on Mac OSX 10.5.5.

First problem is caused by bootstrap.liftweb.Boot lines 23-25. Compiler seems to be confused when models are added to list and then used. Same thing happens if second line is replaced with:

  models.foreach { m => Schemifier.schemify(true, Log.infoF _, m) }

Stack trace is included in compile-boot.log.


Second problem is in the spec for the User model. When lines 25-32 are added, compiles gives stack trace which is included in compile-spec.log. If you replace line 28 with line below, it works as intended.

    (fetched == created) must beTrue


Hopefully that was enough information to reproduce the problem.

Based on dpp's comment of 18 months ago, I deem this a duplicate of #715.
