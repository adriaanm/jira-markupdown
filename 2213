If it's impossible, it's impossible. (And can be closed as such!) If it were possible, I'd sure like it.

You're right that the example would work with that solution, but this is just a simplified test case. In reality, I have a type F[I] that has many subtypes, and I really want to define an implicit def foo[I,Fx<:F[I]](t: Fx): Wrapper[I,Fx] . For most things I can do foo[Fx<:F[_]], but that solution runs into a few other limitations that I'm trying to simplify into something I can turn into a bug report.
