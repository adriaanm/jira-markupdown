The following code produces a set 'values' that contains null when it shouldn't:

{code}
object Foo {

  case object F1 extends Foo
  case object F2 extends Foo

  val values = Set(F1,F2)

}

// remove default and no problem
sealed abstract class Foo private(val bar:Boolean=false) {}

object Bug {

  val foo = Foo.F1 // remove and no problem

  def main(args:Array[String]):Unit = {
	Foo.values contains Foo.F1      // expect true but is false!
	println(Foo.values)	        // contains null instead of F1?!
  }
}

class Bug {}
{code}

Appears to be caused by the combination of referencing F1 from another companion object AND the default constructor argument.

scala:2.8.0.RC1

java:1.6.0_16-b01

os:linux
The code you provide doesn't compile (F1, F2 cannot extend an object).

Can you provide a correct example that displays the bug. Please, reopen the bug once you have done that.


I copied the code from above and it compiled and ran using the following commands...

{code}
adam@laptop:~/progs/scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin$$ ./scalac bug.scala
adam@laptop:~/progs/scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin$$ ./scala Bug
Set(null, F2)
{code}

Here's the verbose version...

{code}

{code}
As iulian suggested, this is a consequence of how objects are compiled. For every object, Scala generates a class which looks like this (java-syntax):
{code}
class Obj {
  public static Obj MODULE$$ = null;
  static this() { MODULE$$ = new Obj(); }
  this() { /* module constructor code */ }
}
{code}

The static initializer is executed exactly once, when the class is loaded.

Every reference to the object {{Obj}} is compiled to an access to the static field {{Obj.MODULE$$}}.


Now for your example, here's the initialization sequence. Note that classes are flattened, so {{Foo.F1}} is {{Foo$$F1}}.

{code}
Bug.<static-init> -> Bug.this() -> foo = Foo$$F1.MODULE$$ -> Foo$$F1.<static-init> ->
Foo$$F1.this() -> Foo.Foo$$$$init$$default$$1() -> Foo.<staic-init> ->
Foo.this() -> values = Set(Foo$$F1.MODULE$$ [*], Foo$$F2.MODULE$$) ->
Foo$$F2.<static-init> -> Foo$$F2.this() -> Foo.Foo$$$$init$$default$$2() [%] ->

OK for Foo$$F2, the super constructor is called, an object is created,
the access to Foo$$F2.MODULE$$ returns the instance.

[*] static init of Foo$$F1 has already been launched, so just get to the field.
    Since the constructor is still running, the MODULE$$ filed is still null.
[%] static init of Foo has already been launched, so just run to the init$$default$$2 method
{code}


I don't think there's a way to fix this issue. Iulian, please let me know if you agree.

Without the default argument, the constructor of {{Foo$$F1[object]}} does not need to call the constructor of {{Foo[object]}}, which breaks the chain described above.

You can reproduce the problem without default arguments:

{code}
object Foo {
  case object F1 extends Foo(getBool)
  case object F2 extends Foo(getBool)

  val values = Set(F1,F2)

  def getBool = false
}

abstract class Foo private(bar: Boolean)

object Bug {
  val foo = Foo.F1

  def main(args:Array[String]):Unit = {
	println(Foo.values)
  }
}
{code}
