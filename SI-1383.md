Maybe I'm not reading the spec properly, but I see nothing wrong with the following code:

{code}
abstract class Env {
  protected def size:Int
}

object EmptyEnv extends Env {
  protected def size = 0
}

class NestedEnv(val parent:Env) extends Env {
  protected def size = 1 + parent.size
}
{code}

However, it spits out this:

{code}
error: method size cannot be accessed in Env
         protected def size = 1 + parent.size
                                         ^
{code}

(Adding *override* to *size* in the subclasses doesn't change anything.)
