{code}
class X(x : Int)

object Y {
        val a = new X
        import a._
        implicit val b : Int = 1
        implicit val c = 2
}
{code}

reports the error:

{code}
error: recursive value b needs type
        val a = new X
                ^
one error found
{code}

which doesn't appear to make sense.
