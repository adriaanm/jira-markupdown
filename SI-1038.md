```scala
class X(x : Int)

object Y {
        val a = new X
        import a._
        implicit val b : Int = 1
        implicit val c = 2
}
```

reports the error:

```scala
error: recursive value b needs type
        val a = new X
                ^
one error found
```

which doesn't appear to make sense.
