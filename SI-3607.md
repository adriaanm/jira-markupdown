I was just bitten by this long standing JVM bug:

http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4071957

This is a problem in Scala when the class matching a structural type, is a non-public inner class, which causes an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown. 

The solution is to call `method.setAccessible(true)` before calling `invoke`.
