This is as expected, or to be expected, or, as the doctors say, as well as could be expected.

The "\r," sequence places a comma in the first column of the terminal.

The difference between the two strings is that one ends in whitespace, so REPL displays it in quotes; the open quote is overstruck instead of the first char of text.

scala> scala.io.Source.fromFile("test2.txt").mkString(",") map { case '\r' => '*' case c => c }
res0: String =
l,i,n,e,1,*,
,l,i,n,e,2,*,
,l,i,n,e,3

scala> "a b c"
res1: String = a b c

scala> "a b c "
res2: String = "a b c "
