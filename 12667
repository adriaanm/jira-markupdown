Thanks, I can confirm the dependency workaround works. I'll look into the code-based fixes when I find a bit of spare time, although as I understand it these are pretty valid use cases (and the unit parser code is, alas, absolutely required for "correct"-ish description of expressions, which is one of Accord's major features to begin with).

Again thanks for your help!
