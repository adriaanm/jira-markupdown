There seems to be an issue when using a generic extractor and which could receive a tuple type. As soon as the generic type parameter in the result type is instantiated with a tuple type, the pattern matcher interprets it as multiple parameters in a match.

{code}
object Foo {
  def unapply[S, T](scrutinee: S)(implicit witness: FooHasType[S, T]): Option[T] = scrutinee match {
    case i: Int => Some((i, i).asInstanceOf[T])
  }
}

class FooHasType[S, T]
object FooHasType {
  implicit object int extends FooHasType[Int, (Int, Int)]
}

object Test {
  val x = 8
  x match {
    case Foo(p) => p // p should be a pair of Int
  }
}
{code}

This should compile. However, it instead results in the following error:
{code}
<console>:21: error: wrong number of arguments for object Foo
           case Foo(p) => p // p should be a pair of Int
                   ^
<console>:21: error: not found: value p
           case Foo(p) => p // p should be a pair of Int
                          ^
{code}

The work-around to use the `FooHasType` implicit to force `T` to be `Any` in the case where it would otherwise be a tuple does not completely solve the issue because then the type info for the components of the tuple gets lost.

So, the bottom line: it seems this bug makes it impossible to provide a representation-independent extractor for types such as `Try`.
More generally, even though we can write a case class with one tuple-valued argument,
we can't express the corresponding extractor.

This finally gives us a use case for Product1:

{code}
scala> case class Holder[T](_1: T) extends Product1[T]
defined class Holder

scala> object Foo { def unapply(x: Any): Some[Holder[(Int, Int)]] = Some(Holder((1, 2))) }
defined module Foo

scala> 1 match { case Foo(t) => t }
res0: Holder[(Int, Int)] = Holder((1,2))
// expected (1, 2) as result type, by analogy to the Product2 extractor:

scala> object Foo { def unapply(x: Any): Some[((Int, Int), Any)] = Some(((1, 2), "foo")) }
defined module Foo

scala> 1 match { case Foo(t, _) => t }
res1: (Int, Int) = (1,2)
{code}

The spec has to be changed, since now it says (specialized to the case for n = 1)

> An unapply method in an object x matches the pattern x(p1) if it takes exactly one argument and unapplyâ€™s result type is Option[T], for some type T.
> In this case, the (only) argument pattern p1 is typed in turn with expected type T.
> The extractor pattern matches then all values v for which x.unapply(v) yields a value of form Some(v1), and p1 matches v1.
