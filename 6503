We have a working implementation of @inheritdoc, somewhat similar to [javadoc's inheritdoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/windows/javadoc.html#{@inheritDoc}) - currently in [pull request](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/69) state. 

More details and an example are on [the Scala Wiki](https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tags+and+Annotations).
