I don't remember what I was trying to do back when I reported this, but the implemented behavior seems more like a feature than a bug. 

If the programmer really wants to pass a null (ugh), he can either change the type bound to {{T >: Null}} or change the ascription to a cast: {code}null.asInstanceOf[T]{code}
