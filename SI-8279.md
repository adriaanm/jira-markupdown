scalac can parse Java sources to break cycles in mixed Scala/Java projects. However, the typer complains about correct (from the Java point of view) imports in Java sources:

```scala
package p1;
public class EnclosingClass {
	public class NestedClass {
	}
}
```

```scala
import p1.EnclosingClass.NestedClass;
public class ConsumingClass {
	NestedClass nc;
}
```

This results in:

```scala
NestedClass is not a member of _root_.p1.EnclosingClass.
```

See [IDE #1000361](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000361)
I believe that this is a duplicate of #7675. I will take the test case over to that ticket.

Looks like I tried to fix it once, but didn't quite get there.
