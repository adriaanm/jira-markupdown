scalac can parse Java sources to break cycles in mixed Scala/Java projects. However, the typer complains about correct (from the Java point of view) imports in Java sources:

{code}
package p1;
public class EnclosingClass {
	public class NestedClass {
	}
}
{code}

{code}
import p1.EnclosingClass.NestedClass;
public class ConsumingClass {
	NestedClass nc;
}
{code}

This results in:

{code}
NestedClass is not a member of _root_.p1.EnclosingClass.
{code}

See [IDE #1000361|https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1000361]
I believe that this is a duplicate of SI-7675. I will take the test case over to that ticket.

Looks like I tried to fix it once, but didn't quite get there.
