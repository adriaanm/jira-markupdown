Most of the time (but not every time), I'm getting a NullPointerException in Actor.resumeReceiver in my project.  I'm attaching my test case (actually, the whole project; it's only 1242 lines total).  run.bat SHOULD run on Linux and Windows (not sure about Mac).  In any case, the main class is named {{xus.testing.PeerTests}} and takes no arguments.  If you run it several times, you should eventually see this stack trace:

{code}

{code}

The actor that is causing the exception is my Connection.selectorActor.  The problem happens because Reactor.searchMailbox is executing when continuation is null.  I noticed that the comment for Reactor.searchMailbox says "assume continuation has been set" and Actor.resumeReceiver has "assert continuation != null" commented out.
