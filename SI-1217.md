The following code:
{code}
object plus {
  var num = 0
  num += 1
}
{code}
highlights "+=" with error message "value += is not a member of Int" and refuses to properly parse the line.
Another example is
{code}
  var list: List[Int] = Nil
  list ::= 1
{code}
with error message "value ::= is not a member of List[Int]".
No change related to that in the parser.
