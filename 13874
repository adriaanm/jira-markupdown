If you hit Control-Space outside of the curly braces defining a class, you get this:

"Content Assist" did not complete normally.  Please see the log for more information.
java.util.NoSuchElementException

I'd expect it to just beep at me.

Kind of a minor issue, but I thought I'd report it anyhow.
