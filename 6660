In 2.10 it says the following:
{noformat}
[error] /repo/scala-issues-dev/tickets/5031/src/main/scala/npe/Id.scala:9: Companions 'type ID' and 'object ID' must be defined in same file:
[error]   Found in /repo/scala-issues-dev/tickets/5031/src/main/scala/npe/package.scala and /repo/scala-issues-dev/tickets/5031/src/main/scala/npe/Id.scala
[error] object ID extends IDs 
[error]        ^
{noformat}
Which sounds like the right error to me, although at a glance the spec doesn't say much about the companionship of type aliases.  If I do that, it compiles fine:
{code}
package object npe {
	
	type ID = Int
}

package npe {

  trait N[X]

  trait IDs {
  	val id = new N[ID] {}
  }

  object ID extends IDs 
}
{code}
Going to call this fixed, reopen if you disagree.
