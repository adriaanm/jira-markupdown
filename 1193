Notably, the exception goes away if you change line 18
{code}
override val service = new TestService
{code}
to
{code}
override val service : Service = new TestService
{code}
Furthermore, I was under the impression that for val overrides that the code for a particular val in a parent should not be executed if it has been overridden.  However, it seems that there must be a corner case for traits because if Contexts is changed from a trait to a class the exception also does not occur.
