:javap is pretty important as a diagnostic/debugging tool

Oracle pretty much forces us to JDK 1.7, but Scala 2.10.4's :javap command doesn't support it.

I can't update to Scala 2.11 because implicit resolution changed in a way that I don't know how to work around (can't compile my project).

Thanks.
I see it's been marked as a duplicate of #6958 â€” I don't know which "superior abilities" are implied, but I would be happy with any abilities at all.
