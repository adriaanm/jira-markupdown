For the life of me I can't figure out exactly what bug is being reported here or whether it's still true.  I have opened ticket SI-1754 to report that .asInstanceOf does not do type inference correctly.  If there is some other bug being reported here, I would appreciate someone reopening the ticket and explaining what it is.
