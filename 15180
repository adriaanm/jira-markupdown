I don't know if this is a bug or a feature :-) but it is not consistent with the JDT behavior. Also this might be the reason for bug scala/bug#2938.

To see the bug:
 * Open a Scala file
 * Make some modifications without saving the file
 * Close the editor without saving the file

When we open the file again we see the unsaved modifications and the editor is marked for unsaved content.

BTW the unsaved modifications are not persistent in the filesystem.

Tested with r21325.
