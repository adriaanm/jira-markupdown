The EBNF of SimpleType and TypeArgs in the current (2.9) version of the scala language specification is:
```scala
SimpleType ::= SimpleType TypeArgs
             | SimpleType ‘#’ id
             | StableId
             | Path ‘.’ ‘type’
             | ‘(’ Types ’)’

TypeArgs ::= ‘[’ Types ‘]’
```

This would allow currying of type args, i.e. Foo[A][B]...[N]. However, as there cannot be more than one TypeParamClause for any type, class or trait, the syntax makes no sense and should be invalid.

For the same reason (A, B)[C] should also be invalid syntax, since that would be an alias for scala.Tuple2[A,B][C].
