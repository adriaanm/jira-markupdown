There seems to be a quite serious error in the higher order type checker:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18830-b20090930020951 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> trait A { type B[X <: Double] = Int}
defined trait A

scala> type C[Z <: A] = Z#B[Boolean]       
defined type alias C
```
