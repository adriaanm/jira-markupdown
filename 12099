looks better now. probably a jekyll/highlighter-rouge thing.
the html still looks a bit weird:
```html
<li><strong>Code blocks</strong> are contained within <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">{{</span></code> this <code class="highlighter-rouge">}}}</code> and may be multi-line.
Indentation is relative to the starting <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> for the comment.</li>
```
