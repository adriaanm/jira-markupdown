I believe this bug was caused by the fix for SI-2323.

We need owners for refinement types since we must be able to check that outer-this references in its decls refer to an enclosing class (I tried removing the owner to see what breaks). We shouldn't, however, be rewriting owners during pickling. See my comments at SI-2323
