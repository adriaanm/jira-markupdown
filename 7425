Fix:

Change (in method treatEscapes, line 146 of File StringContext.scala)
{code}
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr append str substring (start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
{code}

to

{code}
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr append str.substring (start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
{code}

Explanation: in the current version, {{str}} is appended to the buffer, and then on the buffer {{substring}} is called (which has no effect), i.e. without sugar: 
{{bldr.append(str).subsring(start, cur)}}
