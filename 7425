Fix:

Change (in method treatEscapes, line 146 of File StringContext.scala)
```scala
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr append str substring (start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
```

to
```scala
    def output(ch: Char) = {
      bldr append str.substring (start, cur)
      bldr append ch
      start = idx
    }
```

Explanation: in the current version, `str` is appended to the buffer, and then on the buffer `substring` is called (which has no effect), i.e. without sugar: 
`bldr.append(str).subsring(start, cur)`
