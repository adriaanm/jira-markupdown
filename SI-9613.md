In cases where compiler is used in some sort of parallel compilation (e.g. sbt)  statistics (if enabled) are gathered in single place. Regardless of statistics being tempered (e.g. thread A and B wants to push/pop timer: A.push B.push, A.pop B.pop and we end in B -> A for A and  A ~~> B for B ~~ instead of tow medium times we got one long and one short time) it can also fails (e.g. match error on popTimer).
