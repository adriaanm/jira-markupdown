Issues that still need to be resolved:
- Restructuring of the CanAwait property?
- Await vs blocking?
- Feedback from users of SIP-14?
- Remove obsolete public types and members, #6095, #6098 (Philipp)
- More docs
- Update SIP-14 spec for RC1 (lead: Philipp)
- Scaladoc issues: #6099
To follow up to Philipp's above list, I believe that all which remains is documentation-related.

- More docs (if you meant API comments, I actually think we're OK on docs...)
- SIP-14 spec needs to be updated to reflect Try-based signature change
- The specific members/entities which need improved/corrected documentation in #6099
