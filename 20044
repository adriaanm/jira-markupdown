When overriding a method from the self type of a trait the return type is not checked so this compiles:
{code:scala}
trait A {
    def a: Int
}
trait B { self: A =>
    override def a: String = "Well this should not compile"
} 
{code}
The compile error happens when {{B}} is used:
{code:scala}
scala> class C extends A with B
<console>:9: error: overriding method a in trait A of type => Int;
 method a in trait B of type => String has incompatible type
       class C extends A with B
             ^
{code}
The compile error should already happen when defining {{B}} as the method overrides nothing.
