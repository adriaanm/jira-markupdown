This should work.
{code}
import scala.language.dynamics

class A extends Dynamic {
  def selectDynamic(method: String): B = new B(method)
}
class B(method: String) {
  def apply(args: Any*) = println("Called " + method)
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val x = new A
    println(x.bippy("arg"))
  }
}
{code}
Instead, the compile fails:
{noformat}
% scalac3 ./a.scala 
./a.scala:13: error: value applyDynamic is not a member of A
error after rewriting to x.<applyDynamic: error>("bippy")
possible cause: maybe a wrong Dynamic method signature?
    println(x.bippy("arg"))
            ^
one error found
{noformat}
It does compile like this:
{noformat}
  println(x.bippy.apply("arg"))
{noformat}
But that renders it unsuitable for most plausible uses of Dynamic.

This is especially important because if this worked it would offer a way to achieve a more general form of overload than is currently possible.
One might say that this behavior is warranted by SIP-17: http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/completed/type-dynamic.html. Here's a relevant excerpt:

* If qual.sel is followed by a type argument list \[Ts\] (optionally) and an argument list (arg1, …, argn), where none of the arguments argi are named, and argn is not a sequence argument, i.e., of the shape e: _* (the argument list is required, though it may be empty), as in: qual.sel\[Ts\](arg1, …, argn), rewrite the expression to: {{qual.applyDynamic\[Ts\](“sel”)(arg1, …, argn)}}

* If qual.sel is not followed by arguments or an assignment operator: {{qual.selectDynamic\[Ts\](“sel”)}}.

If we follow the letter of the SIP, then {{x.bippy}} in {{x.bippy("arg")}} is followed by an argument list, hence it should get desugared into applyDynamic, not selectDynamic. Do you agree?
I agree that's what the sip says, but as you know I do not generally find such documents particularly relevant. If there's a better way to do things then it's a bug in the sip. I see zero utility in intentionally generating a call to a method which can be seen not to exist and in so doing making it impossible to reach the method which does exist.
