Okay, I just lost twenty minutes by accidentally closing my tab in firefox.  A rather abbreviated version of same:

I discovered while trying to figure this out all the way that the JVM1.4 build has its own private RichString, which does contain contains(String), added by you last april.
{code}
  def contains(arg: String) : Boolean = {
    self.matches(""".*\Q"""+arg+"""\E.*""")
  }
{code}
On the chance it might be obvious to someone else, here is the diff between the 1.4 and 1.5 interpreter outputs, the first one being the one which works.
{code}
< [log typer] infer view from scala.this.Predef.String to ?{val contains: ?}
---
> [log typer] inferring view from scala.this.Char('\012') to lang.this.CharSequence
> [log typer] infer view from scala.this.Char('\012') to lang.this.CharSequence
{code}
Looking just at this, one might think that under 1.5 it tries to convert the argument from Char to something accepted by String (i.e. CharSequence) but then stops short of trying to convert the receiver to something which accepts Char (i.e. RichString.) That would sound like a great explanation except that my attempts to duplicate it do not fail that way, plus I assume such a thing would have been noticed long ago.  I think it is some variation on that, but with one or more additional complicating factors.
