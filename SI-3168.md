If execution of code throws an exception that prints a stack trace in the console, the filenames and line numbers are rendered as hyperlinks, which if clicked, take you there, at least for Java sources.  This does not work for Scala sources.  Interestingly, if the file in question is (say) "Foo.scala" and there is also a "Foo.java" (even in another project) the hyperlink takes you to Foo.java instead.

A picture of the basic failure is attached, including both source files, the console, the project, and even the Scala library with version number (I checked the size first, this one will fit).
(In r21191) Fixed #3168. Also made AspectJ less chatty by default and temporarily removed elideLevel option. Review by community.
