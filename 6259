Nobody commented on runtime overhead of field duplication, which is annoying to avoid.
{code}
class Base( val x : String )
class Derived( x : String ) extends Base( x ) { override def toString = x }
{code}

The above code, for instance, will produce two 'x' fields in \code{Derived}, apparently. I found that variations of this code, however, will not, but I have been unable to gain control of the issue other than by trial and error.
