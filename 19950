Having multiple implicit conversions can lead to duplicate members in a template. This affects `scala.Array` which has its members duplicated 10 times.

Here's a minimized example:

{code}
$ cat A.scala 
package a

trait Foo[S] {
  def foo(t: S): Int = 123
}

trait Boo[T]

object Boo {
  implicit class BooCharIsFoo(boo: Boo[Char]) extends Foo[Char]
  implicit class BooLongIsFoo(boo: Boo[Long]) extends Foo[Long]
}
{code}

If you look at the result of running:
{code}
$ scaladoc -implicits A.scala
{code}

You see that the member `foo` in `trait Boo` is duplicated:
!double-def.png!

The reason is that it's added through the different conversions (`BooCharIsFoo` and `BooLongIsFoo`). 

Now, if the signatures are identical, we could fold the "Implicit Member" information:
{code}
This member can be added in several ways:
  * by the implicit conversion X if ...
  * by the implicit conversion Y if ...
{code}

Now, what if the signatures are different, as is the case here? I don't know what to do. Any suggestions?
