This is due to a Java limitation. In your original code, there's an inherited get method from HashTable that differs only in result type. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9439379/why-does-java-enforce-return-type-compatibility-for-overridden-static-methods

Please experiment with variations on the following minimal example to see the error more directly.

{code}

class Super {
  // uncomment this and comment the last definition of get for the original report
  // def get(): Any = null
}

class Foo extends Super

object Foo {
  // no static forwarder generated in Foo when there's already one in Super
  def get(): Foo = new Foo
  // can't have two static methods with signatures that differ only in their return type
  def get(): Any = null
}
{code}
