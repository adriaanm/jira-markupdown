I don't think it's possible to compile this. The problem is that we have to be very careful which implicits to evaluate, for fear of falling into infinite cycles. So the best thing we could do is give a better error message. I'm reassgning back to you, Paul, but I'm also happy if you turn it into a won't fix subsequently.
