Another way to trigger this bug:

 1. Create and save a file A.scala like the following:
{code}
class A
class B
{code}
 2. Create and save a file C.scala like the following:
{code}
class C {
  val a: A = new B
}
{code}

B does not yet extend A so we correctly get a compilation error _type mismatch; found : pack.B required: pack.A_. Now if we change B to extend A and save A.scala the error message will get removed from the Problems View but not from the editor.

In this example, in contrast with the example provided in the bug report, editing (adding whitespace) and saving C.scala removes the error message from the editor.
