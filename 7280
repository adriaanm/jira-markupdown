I am in favor of warning, but strongly against taking action. Testing equality on unrelated types is a similar issue: we warn that it's probably wrong, but the programmer knows better, so ultimately we generate the bytecode. 

The same principle applies for specialization: if the programmer agrees it's wrong, he can correct the specialization parameters. In the near future we'll have smarter expressions for selecting specialized types, so selection awkwardness will be a non-issue. Shameless plug: Have you seen the Selective Specialization section of [the SIP|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DWm3l4TUmiB_7BzjduuXLZbBcmPBKZbLLbhxGbh3OWM/edit]?
