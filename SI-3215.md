Why isn't the method �toString� for arrays implemented in a similar fashion as it is for lists. With Scala v2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease on Ubuntu 9.10 x86-64 the console output for arrays looks like:
```scala
Array(1, 2, 3).toString /** [I@604e280c */
```

whereas for lists it looks like:

```scala
List(1, 2, 3).toString /** List(1, 2, 3) */
```
