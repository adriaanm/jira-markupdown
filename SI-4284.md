=== What is the expected behavior? ===
Scaladoc should run successfully and generate Scaladocs

=== What do you see instead? ===
On Scala 2.8.1 in certain instances the Scaladoc process will throw a UnsupportedOperationException: Position.point, while only generating a small subset of the scaladocs.
Full output in verbose mode is available here: https://gist.github.com/839747

This bug has been confirmed by testing against Scala 2.8.0 as well:
In Scala 2.8.0, the Scaladocs are generated fine without any problems, whereas in Scala 2.8.1 the described issue arises.

All the affected code is otherwise valid, compiles fine, passes tests and Scaladoc comments for all intents and purposes look valid.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: 1.6.22
  - Operating system: Mac OS X
(In r24334) [scaladoc] Changed TreeFactory so that it doesn't consume exceptions. Required fixes to makeAnnotation and makeTree which were throwing exceptions as a matter of fact. Also code refactoring around annotations and trees. Closes SI-4284. No review.
