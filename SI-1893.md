Steps to reproduce:

1) Create working set "foo"

2) New -> New Scala Project

3) Enable "Add project to working sets"

Expected result:

"foo" is one of the working set options

Actual result:

No working set is available for selection (neither in the combo box or if the "Select..." button is clicked)

This is just a polish item and probably low priority.
Actually this is a duplicate of SI-2703.
