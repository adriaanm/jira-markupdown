There are many examples (including my code). Look at the scaladoc for collection/JavaConversions.scala implicit def asIterator[A](i : ju.Iterator[A]): Iterator[A] method. Specifically:
{code}
* The returned Scala <code>Iterator</code> is backed by the provided Java
* <code>Iterator</code> and any side-effects of using it via the Scala interface will
{code}
when formatted, the "Java" and "<code>Iterator</code>" becomes JavaIterator.
