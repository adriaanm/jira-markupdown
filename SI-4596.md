Storage in ArrayBuffer is implemented in following way (inherited from trait ResizableArray):

{code}
  protected var array: Array[AnyRef] = new Array[AnyRef](math.max(initialSize, 1))  
{code} 

This is however 20x slower in append operations than if a specialized array was used.
In particular, 10M appends took respectively 2.1s vs 0.1s .

Now this is a *big* issue, because Scala has no C++ vector<int> counterpart. I.e. an autoresizable, fast random access container. And there will be no such implementation until ArrayBuffer duplicates it, while in practice it's extremely useful.
