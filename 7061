I restored the old implementation of RedBlack class in the commit https://github.com/erikrozendaal/scala/commit/f656142ddbcecfd3f8482e2b55067de3d0ebd3ce and marked the class as deprecated.

This required renaming the {Red,Black}Tree classes in the RedBlack object to avoid naming conflicts. I renamed them to {Red,Black}Node.
