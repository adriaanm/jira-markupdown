# Start with a valid string literal which compiles.

scala> val N = "00"
N: String = 00

scala> "\"N\" : \"$N\""
res1: String = "N" : "$N"

scala> s"\"N\" : \"$N\""

s"\"N\" : \"$N\""

Using triple quotes is a workaround. I would rather use \" as IntelliJ is overly helpful when autocompleting triple quotes plus it harder to scan {{""""}} than {{"\"}}.
