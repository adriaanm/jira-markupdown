Here is the minimal error producing case:
{code}
// A.java
interface Inter<T> { }

public class A implements Inter<A.Inner> {  
  public class Inner { };
}
{code}
Now reference A from scala and see the crash.  As you can surely see from the test case, it's a result of a class parameterizing an implemented interface with its own inner class.  I am not sure I will look further at this anytime soon, so if someone wants to run with that info, please feel free.
