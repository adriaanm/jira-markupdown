Even though the original report mentions a catch-all exception handler, NonLocalReturnException inherits from RuntimeException so it's even worse.

I'd suggest changing:

{code}
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends RuntimeException with ControlException
{code}

to

{code}
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends ControlException
{code}

That would be an improvement over the current situation.
