Even though the original report mentions a catch-all exception handler, NonLocalReturnException inherits from RuntimeException so it's even worse.

I'd suggest changing:
```scala
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends RuntimeException with ControlException
```

to
```scala
class NonLocalReturnException[T](val key: AnyRef, val value: T) extends ControlException
```

That would be an improvement over the current situation.
