Accessing a transient lazy val from a trait after an object was de-serialized causes a {{NullPointerException}} _if_ the lazy val was accessed _before_ the object was serialized.

One can reproduce this problem with the following classes:

{noformat}
class NotSerializable {
  def foo = "bar"
}

trait Base extends Serializable {
  @transient
  protected lazy val notSerializable = new NotSerializable
}

class BaseImpl extends Base {
  def check: Boolean = Try(notSerializable.foo).isSuccess
}
{noformat}

If you create an instance of {{BaseImpl}}, serialize and de-serialize this instance calling {{check}} works without problems.
If you create an instance, call {{check}}, serialize and de-serialize this instance calling check causes a {{NullPointerException}}.
This is probably related to SI-10075.
