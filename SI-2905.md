**Steps to reproduce the bug**
 1. Create a Scala class A in a file A.scala
 2. Comment out the class definition and save the file
 3. In another file (say B.scala) create a package named _A_ with a package block ({{package A { }}})

Saving the file *B.scala* produces a compilation error saying "A is already defined as object A". To remove this message we have to delete the file *A.scala* (where class A was defined). The same bug can be reproduced if the deleted class and the package were in the same file.

Tested with Eclipse 3.5.1 and SDT r20518.
This is reproducible on the command line with no changes to any of the sources,

bug2905/A.scala
```scala
package bug2905
```

bug2905/B.scala
```scala
package bug2905

package A {
}
```

now with,

```scala
scalac -sourcepath . bug2905/*.scala
```

I see,

```scala
bug2905/B.scala:3: error: A is already defined as object A
package A {
        ^
one error found
```

Nb. the explicit "-sourcepath ." is essential here ... if it is omitted the compilation will complete without error. Also note that the package name has to match a source file name in the same compilation (ie. "package A" or "package B" will trigger the problem with the files A.scala and B.scala present, but "package C" won't).
I realized that this bug affects package objects in a common use case so I now believe that this bug should be fixed (possibly after 2.8).

It turns out that you get the same error when you create a package object in a file with the same name as the package object if the package object is not in the default package.

For example:
```scala
//file: /src/po.scala
package object po { }
```
compiles fine, but
```scala
//file: /src/bugs/po.scala
package bugs
package object po { }
```
produces the following message: "po is already defined as object po".

I believe it is a common case to place a package object in a file with the same name and so this bug should be fixed.
Replying to [comment:11 rytz]:
> All this is only true when you use `-sourcepath` in your project. If you do so, you definitely should follow the naming convention for the source files (i.e. store `class A` in `A.scala`). For package objects, the naming convention is to name the file `package.scala`.

I didn't knew about the naming convention for package objects, sorry about that (it seems that the Scala conventions guide that I've downloaded is outdated).

Despite that I believe that it will be common for new users to try to name the file of a package object using the name of the package object as this is the thing that they are used to do for files that contain classes etc. You might choose not to fix this issue but at least you should consider improving the error message as suggested by Miles in a previous comment.

I completely understand that you might not have the resources to do this now, but I believe that scheduling it for after 2.8 is a better thing to do than closing this issue.

Regarding the `-sourcepath` option I believe that users might not have a choice to stop using it. The problem here is that users might not use `-sourcepath` directly but use tools (like Eclipse, ANT, Maven) that use `-sourcepath`.

Another unrelated thing with `-soucepath` is that in Eclipse we have a major issue (#2767) with classes that are defined in files that do not follow the naming conventions. The presentation compiler reports bogus error messages saying that he cannot find those classes. Can you please elaborate on what problems are caused when you do not follow the naming conventions and use `-sourcepath` to compile you project.
