Is there a way to track down on which file/place/annotation the exception occurs (it's a bigger maven project) - i have tried to add -Xprint:all to the compiler and see where it crashes. But every attempt to reproduce this on a simple test-case has failed yet.

One difference between the project and command line print:all-output makes me curious, though:

On the crashing project I get:

    @new Parameters(Array("webappPath")) @new Test(groups = Array("unit")) 

Whereas the command line version produces

   @org.testng.annotations.Parameters(value = ["webappPath"]) @org.testng.annotations.Test(groups = ["unit"])
