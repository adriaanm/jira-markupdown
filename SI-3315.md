{code}
trait A[@specialized(Int) T] { def foo: T }
class B extends A[Int] { val foo = 10 }
class C extends B
{code}

leads to

{code}
<console>:7: error: class C needs to be abstract, since method foo in trait A of type => Int is not defined
       class C extends B
             ^
{code}

Without the @specialized, this code is accepted.  Tested on 2.8.0.RC1
