In the example where `T` on `Blarg` is *not* specialized, the compiler issues a warning about the lower bound of `W`.
I believe it should issue an error instead - the specialized method cannot be generated with `T` as a lower bound.

I'm experimenting on what would happen if a method with a `T` as a lower bound really got specialized.
