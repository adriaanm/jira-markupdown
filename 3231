Is this the relevant portion of the spec?
```scala
The pattern matches all objects created from constructor invocations c(v1, ..., vn) where each element pattern pi matches the corresponding value vi .
```
If that is the whole of it, someone would be hard pressed to say whether "constructor invocations c(v1, ..., vn)" include or exclude super(v1, ..., vn) without checking with the implementation.  So unless this is made clearer elsewhere I propose that at least the spec should note that subclasses of case classes may be statically excluded from patterns involving that class.  I wouldn't have guessed going in that the pattern matcher actually prohibits some constructs which would otherwise match.
