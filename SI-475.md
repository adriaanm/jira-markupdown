The compiler (scala-2.7.0-RC1) complains because 'match' is used in the package name.

Example:

  package com.blah.match;

The error is:

  Blah.scala:1: error: identifier expected but 'match' found.
  package com.blah.match;
See example 1.1.2 (p. 5) in the Scala specification.

Use backquote-enclosed strings in your code:
```scala
package com.blah.`match`

object test extends Application {
  println("test")
}
```
