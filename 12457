> I'm not sure if the ticket is calling for EBNF or ...

I was calling for some explicit connection (in chapter 1) between `printableChar` and the text that talks about printable characters.  

The simplest solution would be to copy the (pseudo-?)EBNF entry for `printableChar` from the summary character to chapter 1 (so that chapter 1's copy is the normative definition and the summary chapter's copy is just a (non-normative) copy).
