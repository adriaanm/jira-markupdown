this code 
```scala
class C {
  case class M(currentUser: String)(message: String = "")
  def model = Option(M("")()).getOrElse(M("")()).copy(currentUser = "")()
}
```
leads to Error: symbol value x$4$1 does not exist in C.model in 2.9.1 and 2.9.2
or something like the following in later versions

Somewhat minimized; does seem to require a lot of elements working in concert, but I eliminated case classes, nested classes, and copy methods.  Appears to key on anonymous functions nested in anonymous functions.
```scala
class M(x0: Int = 1)(x1: Int = 1) {
  def g(x2: Int = 1) = ()
}

object Test {
  ((null: Option[M]) getOrElse new M()()).g()
}
```
I commented on #5727.  For this example, when the qual$1 is generated (for qual$1.copy), the x$s in the getOrElse have already been generated with owner model, but ownership is not updated to qual$1.

That's why uncurry (in making the Function) fails to update owner. And that's why lambda lift thinks the x$s are free.

I'm about to see where to fix TNA (transformNamedAppl), and if that's it, I'll submit a pull, otherwise bounce the ball back.

makes the example work (and #5727), but I did not yet look for other instances of the bug pattern (failure to change owner).  It seems like something worth encapsulating.

Also, it's probably too "ownerous" [failure to resist pun] to make lambda lift robust against bad ownership; but maybe a debug flag to sanity check it.
