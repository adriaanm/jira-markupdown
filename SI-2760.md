I followed all of the instructions for installing the scala plugin.
Each time I got the following error.


{{An error occurred while installing the items
  session context was:(profile=PlatformProfile, phase=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.provisional.p2.engine.phases.Install, operand=null --> [R]org.eclipse.ant.ui 3.4.1.v20090901_r351, action=org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.touchpoint.eclipse.actions.InstallBundleAction).

SO I went to see if anyone else had the same problem.

I am using 3.5.1 on Turion 64.  I installed via Synaptic Package Manager in Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koola.  It put /usr/lib/eclipse and other directories but nothing in /bin/eclipse.  Can you tell me commands to try in order to see if it is able to function at all and if it is a problem with paths only?  File > New > Project only asks me what wizard.  I tried Java but it still only had Cancel highlighted.  Since Eclipse cannot do normal text editing much less multi-column editing, I try to use it get on to things that just work and forget commands next time I come back.

From the sound of it you have a completely borked Eclipse installation. Try installing the Scala IDE when you have an Eclipse setup which can edit and build Java sources successfully.
