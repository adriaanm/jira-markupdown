The current REPL output for definitions is very confusing because it is almost, but not quite valid Scala and also inconsistent.

Some examples:

{code:scala}
scala> case class Foo()
defined class Foo
{code}

{code}
scala> trait Bar
defined trait Bar
{code}

{code}
scala> type Qux = Nothing
defined type alias Qux
{code}

{code}
scala> val a = 1
a: Int = 1
{code}

{code}
scala> var b = 1
b: Int = 1
{code}

The Scala REPL's response should be more consistent reporting about definitions.
Possible solutions
- no output in the success case (as does the Python REPL)
- display the type definition (as it is currently the case but without "defined" )
- display the type definition as valid Scala
- ...
There's a PR underway for pretty-printing. Also consider output such as
{code}
scala> val (x, y) = (42, 17)
x: Int = 42
y: Int = 17
{code}
Customizing output is not amenable to piece-meal tweaks.
