This is a library issue, probably caused by https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/2d0f82898d
newCanBuildFrom for SortedSet is competing with the normal canBuildFrom.

Since there's an easy workaround (add a toList) and unlikely to be the compiler's fault, lowering priority and re-assigning.

{code}
object Phrase extends Enumeration {
  type Phrase = Value
  val PHRASE1 = Value("My phrase 1")
  val PHRASE2 = Value("My phrase 2")
}

class Entity(text:String)

object Test {
    val myMapWithPhrases = Phrase.values/*.toList*/.map(p => (p -> new Entity(p.toString))).toMap
}
{code}
