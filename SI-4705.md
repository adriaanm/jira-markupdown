typing "ctrl-d" blocks the interpreter, it doesn't echo anymore. with "ctrl-c" you one can kill it and get back to the terminal.
I tried on a different Mac and I see the same behavior.

Here's what I did. At the end, in the {{scala>}} prompt, I typed {{ctrl-d}}. Afterwards, any keystroke does not echo anymore, nothing happens, until I type {{ctrl-c}} and get back to the console.

So first thing I learned from your transcript is that 1.6.0_24 is out on OSX.  I find that for whatever reason my java preferences kept 1.6.0_22 around and were still using that.

Switching to 1.6.0_24 made no difference, I still see ctrl-D working.  I mention it because next I tried openjdk and then I saw what you see.  So this I cannot explain.  It's something environmental, but I don't think the jvm is the direct reason: more of a proxy.

I've intermittently experienced almost the same on locally built pack bins on Windows 7 (built at rev 25149) as well as nightly _2.10.0.r25154-b20110625020222 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_18)_. The only difference is CTRL-C doesn't exit. I have to kill with the Task Manager.

Because it's scala.bat, it's basically equivalent to using the nobootcp option. I'm collecting a stack dump and heap dump and will attach. 

Note it also happens with cygwin even when starting with {{/cygdrive/h/r25154/bin/scala -nobootcp -Djline.terminal=none}} and exiting using {{:quit}}. Never happens when using {{exit}}.
for me it happens always. also after entering some commands, and also when using {{-nobootcp}}.
I've noticed on my Windows 7 64 bits box that the issue is intermittent/not deterministic. It can manifest once then it works fine for many runs. It makes it difficult to bisect for when the problem originated. When it does happen I can get a stack trace and memory dump. The only semi suspicious thing I can find is

Using the Eclipse Memory Analyzer, it seems this pool executor has no task queued up and its {{LinkedBlockingQueue}} is empty. All the threads are showing only {{java.lang}} or {{java.util}} method calls. 

If you guys can try RC3 ASAP (whenever it's out) and make sure it's fixed that'd be great.

Also, Johannes, can you verify that SI-4844 is fixed for you.
