This isn't quite as poignant, but:
{code}
scala> Pair(1,2)
warning: there was one deprecation warning; re-run with -deprecation for details
res0: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

scala> :settings +deprecation

scala> Pair(1,2)
<console>:8: warning: object Pair in object Predef is deprecated: Use built-in tuple syntax or Tuple2 instead
              Pair(1,2)
              ^
res1: (Int, Int) = (1,2)
{code}
