Scala does not understand raw types. This is some of the ``baggage_ that we dropped from Java. When Scala sees a raw type it treats it as an existential. Unfortunately, that means that in the case above class B extends A with **some unknown** type parameter T. Since T is unknown, we can't implement a run method with this type. So we are stuck.

The only thing one can do in these situations is implement a subclass in Java that implements the method. I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do without introducing raw types into Scala. And the latter we want to avoid.
