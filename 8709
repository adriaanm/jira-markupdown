I've submitted Rex's suggestions as https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1690.

Santosh: you can use {{raw"c:\foo\$filename"}} to avoid interpreting '\' as an escape character.

But beware, {{\uNNNN}} is always treated as a unicode escape, unless you use the non-standard compiler option {{-Xno-uescape}}. I always use '/' as a path separator in literal strings to avoid these issues; even on Windows this is allowed.
