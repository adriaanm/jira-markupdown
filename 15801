Having definition.
{code}
 class X { def y = 1; def z = 2 }
{code}

and using it like:
{code}
  new X { y;z }
{code}

we're having anonymous class generated. But usually this type of code is just used to avoid boilerplate like:
{code}
 val x = new X
 x.y
 x.z
 x....
{code}

Compiler should avoid generating anonymous classes in such cases, performing "rewriting" code in boilerplate style if it can.
