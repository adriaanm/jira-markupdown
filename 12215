Sorry about that. I wasn't paying much attention to who commented, just saw "What OS?".

Anyway, I'm on Win10 64-bit, using cyginw64 (not sure what version, but very recent), running inside ConEmu 151210.

I'm actually running through {{scala.bat}} now and it mostly works, although seems to hang on {{:quit}}. Again, some of this could be ConEmu related, not sure.
