A usability bug is still a bug.  Or I guess this would be a confusability bug.

This isn't an option setting: there are two distinct modes, normal and paste.  "load" is straightforward but ambiguous, since load could mean read but don't run.  "run" is more obvious in that regard, or "script" qua script.  Maybe "paste" is also not the right word. "block" insert. "here".  "run << EOF" etc.
