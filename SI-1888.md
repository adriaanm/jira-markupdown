OS: Windows XP;
Scala plugin: 2.7.3.final


My project is located deep in the directory structure. As a result, temp files in the ".manager" directory are generated with very long names.

The file name itself is not longer then 256 characters, but together with directory it is long enough to cause errors in Windows explorer and to crash Eclipse on rebuild.
Yes, it's no longer relevant ...
