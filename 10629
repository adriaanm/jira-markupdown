I can't actually reproduce the problem as I don't know where to find releases of sbinary for M8.

I used this minimization:

{code}
object Test {
  val g: scala.tools.nsc.Global = ???

  import g._

  def foo(r: Range) = r: scala.Range
}
{code}

Which starts giving the same error as your report when `Range` was added to a supertype of `Global`.

But something still doesn't add up.
