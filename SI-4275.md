=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
scala -optimise

```scala
scala> "abc".count(_ > 'a')
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
res0: Int = 2


=== What do you see instead? ===
error: value count cannot be accessed in java.lang.String
"abc".count(_ > 'a')
      ^
=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:2.8.1
  - Java:1.6.0-22+
  - Operating system: linux & windows
Related to #1071.  The same bug really, but java style: something about running under -optimise changes the access model enough to trigger the same issue. (It's the private count field of String leaking out.)

```scala
public final class java.lang.String extends java.lang.Object implements java.io.Serializable,java.lang.Comparable,java.lang.CharSequence{
    private final char[] value;
    private final int offset;
    private final int count;
```
An all scala version.
```scala
class A {
  private val count: Int = 0
}
class B extends A { }
object B {
  implicit def b2seq(x: B): Seq[Int] = Nil
  
  def f = (new B) count (_ > 0)
}
```
(In r24740) Closes #4275. Review by plocinic since this is the first code that treats errors as trees. As discussed, it would be good to use this pattern more systematically.
