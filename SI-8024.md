test.scala:13: error: reference to sqrt is ambiguous;
it is both defined in object FastComplex and imported subsequently by
import java.lang.Math.sqrt
  sqrt(0d)
  ^
one error found
```

```scala
package p

trait NRoot[A]

object `package` {
  final def sqrt(x: Double): Double = Math.sqrt(x)
  final def sqrt[A](a: A)(implicit ev: NRoot[A]): A = ???
}

object FastComplex {
  import java.lang.Math.sqrt

  sqrt(0d)
}
```

As seen in Spire: https://github.com/retronym/spire/tree/topic/2.11-compat
Actually, this looks like a progression, it is now consistent with a non-overloaded method in a package object and an example with nesting:

```scala
// Fails uniformly on 2.10 and 2.11
object Enc {
  def sqrt(x: Double): Double = Math.sqrt(x)
  def sqrt(x: String): Double = Math.sqrt(0)
  object FastComplex {
    import java.lang.Math.sqrt

    sqrt(0d)
  }
}
```
