As I briefly proposed in the meeting yesterday, it would be useful to have a command line tool called "scalawhich" that could be used to determine whether the scala compiler and related tools will find a particular class, where, and perhaps a trace of the heuristics used.
I implemented this today as well.  Does this sample capture what you're looking for? I'm not 100% clear on what your use case is so I'm looking to make sure it does what you want before I submit it.
```scala
$$ src/scalawhich.scala -cp /local/lib/java/*:/local/lib/scala/* scala.List 
Found scala/List.class in /scala/inst/trunk/lib/scala-library.jar
$$ src/scalawhich.scala -cp /local/lib/java/*:/local/lib/scala/* org/objectweb/asm/util/Traceable
Found org/objectweb/asm/util/Traceable.class in /local/lib/java/asm-debug-all-3.1.jar
$$ src/scalawhich.scala scala.collection.Map
Found scala/collection/Map.class in /scala/inst/trunk/lib/scala-library.jar
$$ src/scalawhich.scala 'scala/Enumeration$$Value'
Found scala/Enumeration$$Value.class in /scala/inst/trunk/lib/scala-library.jar
```
I took some pains to use the scala compiler mechanisms for classpath resolution and etc so it should only find all those and only those classes you'd find on a compiler run with the same -cp argument.
(In r20889) Rewrote my own submitted code of a year ago from trac and added
scalawhich to the tools dir.  Closes #657.
