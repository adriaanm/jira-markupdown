Yes, it has sounded to me throughout like the semantic gap is that on the specifying side, "named arguments" is used to mean only those cases where the names are necessary, not simply where they are provided. If you could remove the names and it would still work, that's not what it means by "named arguments." On the hearing side, people think "named arguments" means any time the names are written down.

That's all in the realm of specification lawyering, and is separate from what should be the relevant question of whether the behavior represents the optimal tradeoff.
