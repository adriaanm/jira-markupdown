We could add a `tuple` method on `TupleNZipped`.

Now:
```scala
scala> for ((a, b, c) <- (Nil, Nil, Nil).zipped.map(Tuple3.apply)) yield ()
res5: List[Unit] = List()
```

Proposed:
```scala
scala> for ((a, b, c) <- (Nil, Nil, Nil).zipped.tuple) yield ()
res5: List[Unit] = List()
```

We're unlikely to provide these classes for larger N right now. We hope that the current research into Scala macros will allow us to deliver this sort of code without the boilerplate.
