=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Using Scala dbc does not produce any deprecation notice. However, there's no Scaladoc for it, and a previous ticket indicated it was no longer actively supported.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

It should be either deprecated or have scaladoc available and be actively supported.

=== What do you see instead? ===

It's in a limbo.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: trunk
  - Java: not relevant
  - Operating system: not relvant
(In r24462) Deprecated scala.dbc.  Wish there was a better way to deprecate a
package than deprecating every individual thing.  (There isn't, is
there?) Closes SI-4313, no review.
