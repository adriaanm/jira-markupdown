current:
{code}
scala> <abc/>
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <abc></abc>
{code}

after patch:
{code}
scala> <abc/>
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <abc/>
{code}
With this patch (submitted here for review, not committed yet!), the originally parsed emptiness modes of elements are now preserved on output:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r21213-b20100318230317 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> <hi>there <man/><how></how>'s it going?</hi>
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <hi>there <man/><how></how>'s it going?</hi>
{code}

Please note that this version of the patch does not (yet) make any changes to tests, so some of them will probably fail until I update it tomorrow.

If people are happy with this approach, I'll update the tests (and write a few more) and throw it out for wider comment.
I brought my patch up to date with master, https://github.com/acruise/scala/tree/t1118.  It compiles, tests pass (for me at least!) and it works:

{code}
