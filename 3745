Oh, no, it's not ambiguous at all. ‘The expected type of the final expression _e_ is the expected type of the block.’ So that pushes the conversion into the block.

I suppose my wonderings still stand, but now it's a question of (probably) complicating the spec and (very probably) the implementation for gains in this particular edge case and uncertain other effects.
