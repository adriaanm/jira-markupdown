trait A[@specialized(Int, Long) K, @specialized(Float, Double) V] {
  def doStuff(k: K, v: V): Unit = println("Hi - I'm calling doStuff in A")
}

trait B[@specialized(Float, Double) V] extends A[Int, V] {
  override def doStuff(i: Int, v: V): Unit = println("Hi - I'm calling doStuff in B")
}

object Run {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val a = new A[Long, Float]() {}
    a.doStuff(1L, 0.1F)

    val b = new B[Double]() {}
    b.doStuff(1, 0.1)

    delegate(a, 1L, 0.1F)
    delegate(b, 1, 0.1)
  }

  def delegate[@specialized(Int, Long) K, @specialized(Float, Double) V](a: A[K, V], k: K, v: V): Unit = a.doStuff(k, v)
}

When I run this against 2.9.1-FINAL, I get the output:

Hi - I'm calling doStuff in A
Hi - I'm calling doStuff in B
Hi - I'm calling doStuff in A
Hi - I'm calling doStuff in A

I expected the output:

Hi - I'm calling doStuff in A
Hi - I'm calling doStuff in B
Hi - I'm calling doStuff in A
Hi - I'm calling doStuff in B

The cause is that in A, scalac generates doStuff specialized to K and V (e.g. ID$sp). Then B provides a concrete type for K, and it's specialized form of doStuff gets specialized on D only (e.g. D$sp). When the specialization gubbins sees a reference of type B, it binds the D$sp form. When it sees a reference of type A, it binds the ID$sp form. However, in instances of B, the ID$sp form does not forward to the D$sp form, so the wrong implementation of doStuff is invoked.

In this case, a robust fix would be for scalac to note that the doStuff provided in B over-rides doStuff provided in A, that K has been fixed to Int, and therefore to push Int back in to the list of types to specialize over (effectively treating @specialized(Int, Long) K as @specialized(Int) K). This would result in B.doStuff being specialized to ID$sp, and therefore for the correct code to be invoked regardless of the type of the reference.
Somewhat reduced.
```scala
trait A[@specialized(Int) K, @specialized(Double) V] {
  def doStuff(k: K, v: V): Unit = sys.error("I am overridden, you cannot call me")
}

trait B[@specialized(Double) V] extends A[Int, V] {
  override def doStuff(k: Int, v: V): Unit = println("Hi - I'm calling doStuff in B")
}

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = delegate(new B[Double]() {}, 1, 0.1)

  def delegate[@specialized(Int) K, @specialized(Double) V](a: A[K, V], k: K, v: V) {
    a.doStuff(k, v)
  }
}
```
I can see where this goes wrong, but I don't know the right way to fix it.
