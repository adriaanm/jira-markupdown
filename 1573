Should be easy to implement, here's a short test (taken from http://java.sun.com/developer/JDCTechTips/2001/tt0410.html#using):
```scala
public strictfp class FPTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double d = 8e+307;
        System.out.println(4.0 * d * 0.5);
        System.out.println(2.0 * d);
    }
}
```

There seems to be no equivalent on .NET, so this will have an effect only on jvm targets.
