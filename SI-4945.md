In Scala 2.9.1.RC4, the "-i 'file'" command line argument (which is supposed to preload a file before starting the REPL) does not work.  For example, consider a file "preload.scala" containing just 'println("Hello world.")'.  Scala 2.9.1.RC4 says "Loading preload.scala..." and never yields the prompt.  It hangs indefinitely.  Conversely, the "-i" command line arguments works as expected in Scala 2.9.0.1, yielding the prompt after printing "Hello world."
That's unfortunate.  As a workaround, supply command line option -Yrepl-sync.

This seems to have acquired even more breakage.
{code}
scala3 -Yrepl-sync -i bip.scala 
Loading bip.scala...
bad option: '-i:bip.scala'
{code}
