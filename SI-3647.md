It would appear that loading a PagedSeq with the fromSource function strips out newline characters where it didn't in Scala 2.7.7.  This REPL sessions was completed with Scala 2.8.0.RC7.
```scala
scala> val ps = scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq.fromSource(scala.io.Source.fromFile("./RMDB.csv"))
ps: scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq[Char] = PagedSeq(I, N, S, N,...
scala> ps.filter(x => x == '\n').size                                                                 
res4: Int = 0
```
By changing this to use the fromFile function instead, all works as expected again.
```scala
scala> val ps = scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq.fromFile("./RMDB.csv")                            
ps: scala.collection.immutable.PagedSeq[Char] = PagedSeq(I, N, S, N,...
scala> ps.filter(x => x == '\n').size                                                                 
res6: Int = 283
```
This does not appear to be caused by the Source object itself, as I can still get a count of newline characters as I would expect directly from it.
```scala
scala> val src = scala.io.Source.fromFile("./RMDB.csv")
src: scala.io.BufferedSource = non-empty iterator
scala> src.filter(x => x == '\n').size                 
res10: Int = 283
```
This issue was identified when trying to parse a streaming file upload in a web application.
I am beyond embarrassed that it took me so long to see the cause of this bug, and Paul even pointed to the very code I was looking at as the source of the problem... In ./src/library/scala/collection/immutable/PagedSeq.scala, the following code does not set isFirst to false under the correct conditional.  As a result, it never changes to false, and no newline characters are added to the beginning of each String.
```scala
  /** Constructs a character sequence from a line iterator
   *  Lines do not contain trailing `\n' characters; The method inserts
   *  a line separator `\n' between any two lines in the sequence.
   */
  def fromLines(source: Iterator[String]): PagedSeq[Char] = {
    var isFirst = true
    fromStrings(source map { line =>
      if (isFirst) line 
      else { 
        isFirst = false
        "\n"+line
      }
    }) 
  }      
```
As a result, fromLines will always result in the same result as fromStrings.
(In r23555) Fixes #3647, closes #3647, adds a test case for it, and a missing test case for #3935.

No review.
