Let's be clear about what is happening here: there's no "applyDynamic" defined on the class in the example. So, when the compiler sees that a method does not exist, it tries to find the applyDynamic method to handle it. Since it doesn't exist, it tries to find the applyDynamic method to handle the applyDynamic method, and on and on.

The compiler should _not_ do that. Furthermore, IMHO, any non-abstract class extending Dynamic should implement applyDynamic or an error should be returned.
