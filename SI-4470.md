=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/collection/immutable/List$$.html

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
The deprecation attribute should be displayed correctly.

=== What do you see instead? ===
The formatting is broken.
Ok, these problems are a duplicate of #4490 ... they will be fixed as soon as someone manages to commit the changes to the scala svn.
