Hi Prokopec,

it seems you fixed ++, but missed update.

As far as I understand, either overriding update from MapLike with
```scala
override def updated [B1 >: B](key: A, value: B1): TreeMap[A, B1] = updated(key, value)
```
or copying it from updated like this
```scala
override def update [B1 >: B](key: A, value: B1): TreeMap[A, B1] = {
  val newsize = if (tree.lookup(key).isEmpty) size + 1 else size
  TreeMap.make(newsize, tree.update(key, value))
} 
```
should work.

"update" is deprecated, but I guess that small fix won't hurt until the method is removed completely, considering that it might still be heavily used until that happens.

If you closed it because there is some rule not to fix deprecated methods, than accept my apology for reopening it.
