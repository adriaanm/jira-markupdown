```scala
Stream(1 to 10).flatten.toList
```
Infinite loop.  Worked in beta1, looping since at least rc1.
(In r22160) Discovered and disproved this unlikely truth:

  scala> (1 to 1 drop 1) == (1 to 1)
  res0: Boolean = true

It was introduced in r21349 which was to fix #2535, but led to #3529.
I humbly suggest we can't afford to introduce bugs of this severity
in the pursuit of corner cases such as Ranges which use Int.MaxValue
as a boundary.  And looking at the patch I find the "after" code
a lot harder to follow.  Closes #3529.  Review by prokopec.
(In r22161) Burned by a last minute adjustment, I lost the downward
counting direction.  It is a seriously fiddly process to
adjust Range and I don't recommend it to anyone.  Closes #3529
over again.  Review by prokopec.
