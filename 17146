This doesn't compile:
```scala
def f(a: Int*) = a match {
  case 0 :: Nil => "List(0)! My favorite Seq!"
  case _ => a.toString
}
```
```
error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : collection.immutable.::[B]
 required: Int*
```

But this does:
```scala
def f(a: Int*) = (a: Seq[Int]) match {
  case 0 :: Nil => "List(0)! My favorite Seq!"
  case _ => a.toString
}
```

I think it's obvious, but per the spec, the identifier `a` should already have the type Seq[Int] inside the body of `f` in either case, yet in the first case, the compiler seems to think that `a` has a type which is a strict subtype of Seq[Int] and which List does not extend.

Seems related to (if not a dupe of) scala/bug#4176.
