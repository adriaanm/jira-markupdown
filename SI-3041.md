hi guys,

Just wanted to drop a note that the Feb 10 development build of the Eclipse plugin seems crazy toxic. After updating, my Eclipse closed out, then started in a strange state (all views could not load), then wouldn't restart again until I passed -clean on the command line. 

After loading with -clean, type search (ctrl-shift-T) would hang at 97%. After uninstalling the plugin, everything cooled down.

I've never had problems before.

My Eclipse info is below.

Thanks for the plugin! 
Brien

Feb 10th? You're a visitor from the future? ;-)

Can you give the the exact version of the IDE (it will contain the exact revision number)?

I expect that this is random upgrade breakage, however. If you're following trunk and updating regularly your install and workspace will accumulate cruft over time (this is a generic Eclipse issue). I recommend always running with the -clean option rather than waiting until something goes wrong.


Oops wish it was tomorrow today ;)

From the installation details, I have:

Eclipse SDK	3.5.1.M20090917-0800	org.eclipse.sdk.ide

Is this the version string you're looking for?
