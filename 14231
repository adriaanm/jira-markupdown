When converting an NFA into a DFA, SubsetConstruction.determinize removes the initial state from the set of final states if it happened to be there.

This happens because the only place that updates the target finals map is the function add(), which is used to add all states _except_ the initial and sink states. The sink state can never be final, but the initial state can.

The attached source code shows an example of an NFA in which the initial state is a final state, and prints both that NFA and the DFA computed by SubsetConstruction.determinize.
