 `withFilter' method does not yet exist on Iterator[Int], using `filter' method instead
     for (x <- Iterable(1,2,3).iterator if (x % 2 == 0)) yield x;
{code}

see SI-2540
#2540 was closed but this doesn't seem to be addressed; there's still no 'withFilter' on Iterator.

Perhaps I'm not clear on the intentions behind withFilter, but it seems that using a for comphrehension guard with an Iterator should either

* Work without a deprecation error
* Not work at all

Obvious preference for the former.

At the moment, withFilter is commented out in Iterator.scala, with this comment

{code}
/** !!! Temporary, awaiting more general implementation.
  *  ... better wait longer, this fails once flatMap gets in the mix.
  */
// def withFilter(p: A => Boolean) = this.toStream withFilter p
{code}
There at least two easy ways this ticket could be fixed:
(1) Trac SI-2540 suggests an efficient implementation for Iterator.withFilter.
(2) Declare
        def withFilter(p: A => Boolean) = filter(p) 

The commented out implementation using toStream is inappropriate as Scala's streams are not sufficiently lazy for such usage: the iterator's hasNext and next would be called too early.

(In r19911) Closes SI-2540 and closes SI-2593.
