I moved test/files/jvm/interpreter.scala to pending for now. It stops running on more and more machines because default heap size is not enough for it. It seems that my addition of 55 bridge forwarder methods and 5 new interfaces pushed it over the edge here. We should find pass a sufficient heapsize to the subprocess that runs the interpreter and then bring the test back.

(In r24964) Temporarily sending lisp.scala to be interpreter.scala's equally
memory hungry buddy in pending.  References SI-4512.  This should be
straightened out imminently, but I will solve this more easily by
looking forward, not backward.  No review.
(extempore in [r25047|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25047]) Restored the lisp.scala test.  I already restored the intepreter
test in r25038, so closes #4512, no review.
partest defaults tweaked, lisp test reinstated by Paul in r25387. hopefully it won't start failing
the build again. optimistically closing the ticket.

SI-4579 moved the lisp testing into pos/, still looking for a volunteer to promote it to run/
(be warned, that goal is not just a `git mv` away)
