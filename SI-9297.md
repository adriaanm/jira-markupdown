See this old and forgotten issue mentioned on the mailing lists: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/scala-internals/method$20transpose$20is$20broken/scala-internals/ug-eJ1OUEMI/ioCpv3KobysJ

In short: transpose shouldn't throw an exception in the input collections have different sizes:
```scala
scala> List(List(1, 2, 3), List(4, 5)).transpose
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: transpose requires all collections have the same size 
```
See #8880, it could also be fixed when this one is fixed.
@sschaef   For the record, could you summarize in more detail why transpose shouldn't fail, and also what the "natural" expected result would be?  I can go read old mailing lists, but usually any bug that requires reading old mailing lists to understand gets such a low impact-to-effort score that I end up not getting to it at all.
@sschaef  The mailing list thread doesn't really tackle the problem adequately.

One invariant you would expect from transpose (let's call it T for short) is that `xs == T(T(xs))`.  However, with the Haskell approach that invariant is violated.  So I really don't like that one.  I agree that there is value in a transpose-like method, maybe `collapseByColumn`, that does what Haskell does, but I don't think `transpose` is the name for it.

Now, I do think that transpose could should be able to handle any list that is in length-descending order; then the invariant is obeyed.  Is that change of value, do you think?
