Scaladoc seems to capture variables in some places. For instance, in the API documentation for Map, we see:
```scala
def foldLeft [B] (z: B)(op: (B, (A, B)) ⇒ B): B
```

Which I found confusing until I realized that B is also the name given to the second parameter of Map at the beginning of the file. So, not all of those Bs are the same, and the actual signature is:
```scala
def foldLeft [R] (z: R)(op: (R, (A, B)) ⇒ R): R
```

One can also see the problem in the type mentioned in [this bug](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3448). The B in the argument type to f is different than all the other Bs in the type.
