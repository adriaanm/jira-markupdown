StdLexical's scanner doesn't recognise '_' as a part of an identifier, though in most languages, including scala, it is considered part of an identifier.

For eg, foo_bar should be considered a single identifier/keyword.

Suggested fix:
Currently in StdLexical.scala:

{code}
def token: Parser[Token] =  ( letter ~ rep( letter | digit )

{code}

This can instead be:

{code}
def underscore = elem("underscore", c => == '_')
def letterUnderScore = (letter | underscore)
def token: Parser[Token] =  ( letterUnderScore ~ rep( letterUnderScore | digit )
{code}
