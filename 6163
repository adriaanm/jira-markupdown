If it helps add context, I put my sbt package object in the final subproject that aggregates everything.  So, I'm personally ok with a restriction that the contents of {{package object x}} are not visible within {{x}}.  I realize that this is probably a common use case in practice (if I remember correctly, my example above was a minimization of a user's code), but I figured I'd mention it as how I deal with package objects.  It has the drawback that I haven't figured out how to build scaladoc that includes the package object (introduces cycles).
