Steps to reproduce:

1.) Create project called "a", create package "a", create class "A" in package a.
2.) Copy something from another Scala editor that uses some imported things. I can reproduce it with scala.nsc.CompilationUnits line 30: "var fresh : FreshNameCreator"
3.) Go to class body of A and paste.
4.) Either see error dialog, or observe an automatically added import. In the latter case do an undo, paste and undo a couple of times again. Then try to close editor. Eclipse freezes.

For more fun:

5.) Delete project, check delete from filesystem.
6.) Recreate project.
7.) Previous content still there.

Tried with nightly from Feb 17 on Mac OS X Java 1.5
Duplicate of (part of) #1253 and fixed in r17135, so try again with todays nightly.

I've created a separate ticket for the project deletion issue. In future please create separate tickets for distinct issues.
Hmm ... actually, I can't reproduce the project deletion issue at all with the most recent nightly.
