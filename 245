If I understand your example correctly, this works exactly as would be expected from call-by-name evaluation as described in the Scala Reference.  It says "This indicates that the corresponding argument is not evaluated at the point of function application, but instead is evaluated at each use within the function."  `block` is not actually used until the closure `g` is invoked, so this behaves as described.
