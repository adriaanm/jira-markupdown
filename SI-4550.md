=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? 

Consider the following code:
===
```scala
package test

trait Meta {
  protected def foo(s: String, i: Int): String = "Meta [%s, %d]".format(s, i)
}

class Foo {
  def meta = Foo
  def foo(i: Int):String = meta.foo("Hello", i)
}

object Foo extends Foo with Meta
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

This used to compile till 2.8.1. Should compile in 2.9.0.RC3 too (not tested on previous 2.9 RCs though).

=== What do you see instead? ===

```scala
Foo.scala:9: error: too many arguments for method foo: (i: Int)String
  def foo(i: Int):String = meta.foo("Hello", i)
                                   ^
one error found
```

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9.0.RC3
  - Java: 1.6.0_24
  - Operating system: OSX 10.6.7
I sent david pollak an email explaining this (because I also saw it when compiling lift against rc3) did he not send it to you?

It is invalid, and it should not have compiled in 2.8.1.  See the email for lengthy elaboration.  protected is not a two-way street.  See #3871.
Thanks for the heads up!

I hadn't tracked that discussion earlier, but I can see where it is coming from.
