Sorry for not commenting on this before you got to it, Toni.  There are some other updates needed related to by-name parameters.  Functions can have more than one by-name parameter and can include other parameters that are not by-name.

Line 1118 of !ReferencePart mentions "... the type `(=>T) => U` represents functions with call-by-name parameters ..." and line 5714 describes restrictions on eta expansion that no longer apply.  Presumably `=> T` was not a proper type and so it was treated specially, but now that it is a proper type, those sections can be deleted.

The syntax definition of line 1111 needs to be updated (and the summary on line 783).  `=>` is now valid in front of any parameter type and `*` is allowed as well.  The special case for by-name functions can be removed and the first case can have `InfixType` replaced with `ParamType`.

In general, I'd be happy to submit patches for the spec if it is useful and someone wants to review my patches.
