Now the method withFilter of scala.collection.immutable.Stream is defined in scala.collection.TraversableLike. This lead to some problemsï¼š
{code}
scala> val nums = Stream.from(1)
nums: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)

scala> val even = for(n <- nums if n%2 == 0) yield n

I think we should override withFilter in Stream like following(not test):

{code}
abstract class Stream[+A] extends LinearSeq[A] 
                             with GenericTraversableTemplate[A, Stream]
                             with LinearSeqOptimized[A, Stream[A]] {
self =>
  ...
  
  final override def withFilter(p: A => Boolean): WithFilter = new StreamFilter(p)
  
  class StreamFilter(p: A => Boolean) extends WithFilter(p) {
  
    def map[B, That](f: A => B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = 
      (if(isEmpty) Stream.Empty
	   else if(p(head)) new Stream.Cons(f(head), tail.withFilter(p).map(f).asInstanceOf[Stream[B]])
       else tail.withFilter(p).map(f).asInstanceOf[Stream[B]]
	  ).asInstanceOf[That]
	
    def flatMap[B, That](f: A => Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That = 
	  (if(isEmpty) Stream.Empty
       else if(p(head)) f(head).toStream append tail.withFilter(p).flatMap(f).asInstanceOf[Stream[B]]
	   else tail.withFilter(p).flatMap(f).asInstanceOf[Stream[B]]
	  ).asInstanceOf[That]
 
    def foreach[U](f: A => U): Unit = 
      for (x <- self) 
        if (p(x)) f(x)

    def withFilter(q: A => Boolean): WithFilter = 
      new StreamFilter(x => p(x) && q(x))
  }
}
{code}
BTW, I think we could fix Ticket SI-2634 in a very simple way after this ticket be fixed.
(In r21375) Gave Stream a lazy withFilter implementation.  Now you too
can have a collection containing all the even numbers in the
universe and still be home in time for tea.  Threw in some
Stream cleanups for free.  Closes SI-3265, review by community.

You are now equipped to demonstrate! Because I tried, and it doesn't look like a simple task to me.

Take Tuple2 for example, I think  SI-2634 would be fixed if we chang the implementation of class Tuple2#Zipped like this:
{code}
class Zipped[+Repr1, +El1, +Repr2, +El2](coll1: TraversableLike[El1, Repr1], coll2: IterableLike[El2, Repr2]) { 
    def map[B, To](f: (El1, El2) => B)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[Repr1, B, To]): To = {
      val elems2 = coll2.iterator

      for(el1 <- coll1 if(elems2.hasNext)) yield f(el1, elems2.next)
    }
	...
}
{code}

And Tuple2#zip should be changed in the same way.

Since I don't have chance to test it, I apologize if I have missed something.

It confused me very much. I try to find the reason why it doesn't work as my expected. I find another Ticket SI-3273.

I have some ideas about SI-2634 and I post it here: [http://old.nabble.com/Some-ideas-of-lazy-version-takeWhile-method-in-TraversableLike.-td28189940.html]
