<sub><sub>Exception only occurs when the RelyingParty?.Listener is not fully implemented, so it might be an error in a error-reporting part of the compiler.</sub></sub>

Correction: Exception only occurs when RelyingParty.Listener is implemented.
```scala
  relyingParty.addListener (new RelyingParty.Listener {
```
Fully implementing it does not solve the issue.

Also, if you haven't already notices, "JSON.class" exists in several jars.
