String.format does not work with Array[Int] type as data value.
```scala
scala> Console.println(String.format("This string will %s", Array("work")))
This string will work

scala> Console.println(String.format("This number will fail: %d", Array(99)))     
<console>:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Int(99)
 required: java.lang.Object
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method int2Integer in object Predef of type (Int)java.lang.Integer
 and method intWrapper in object Predef of type (Int)scala.runtime.RichInt
 are possible conversion functions from Int(99) to java.lang.Object
       Console.println(String.format("This number will fail: %d", Array(99)))
```

If possible, please add wrapper to Predef so programmer can pass Scala "varargs" instead of Array.
Changed component from compiler to library.

Also this ticket can be easily solved after https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/ticket/706 is done.
In 2.7.2 a format method was added to RichString, so you can do this:
```scala
Console.println("This number will fail: %d".format(99))
```
...except of course it won't fail, it'll succeed.
