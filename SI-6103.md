Strictly speaking, this is not a regression, but causes other regressions in the standard library (see https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6101, https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5976), and may be a blocker.

Scala file:

{code}
trait Func1[R] {
  def apply(): R = null.asInstanceOf[R]
}


class Func1ReturnString extends Func1[String]
{code}

Java file:

{code}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Func1ReturnString b = new Func1ReturnString() {};
	b.apply();
    }
}
{code}

This crashes {{javac}}:

{code}
Test.java:7: error: apply() in Func1ReturnString cannot implement apply() in Func1
	Func1ReturnString b = new Func1ReturnString() {};
	                                              ^
  return type Object is not compatible with String
  where R is a type-variable:
    R extends Object declared in interface Func1
1 error
{code}

The reason is that {{mixin}} does not generate an appropriate signature for {{apply}}. Trees at the end of {{cleanup}}:

{code}
package <empty> {
  abstract trait Func1 extends Object {
    def apply(): Object
  };
  class Func1ReturnString extends Object with Func1 {
    def apply(): Object = Func1$class.apply(Func1ReturnString.this);
    def <init>(): Func1ReturnString = {
      Func1ReturnString.super.<init>();
      Func1$class./*Func1$class*/$init$(Func1ReturnString.this);
      ()
    }
  };
  abstract trait Func1$class extends  {
    def apply($this: Func1): Object = null;
    def /*Func1$class*/$init$($this: Func1): Unit = {
      ()
    }
  }
}
{code}

If you look at {{apply}} above, the return type is {{Object}} instead of {{String}}. This happens in general whenever a method signature changes due to a more refined type environment in an inheriting class and the method is not overridden/implemented in the inheriting class.

In some other situations {{javac}} compiles the file, but produces bytecode which refers to a non-existing method (signature-wise). See an example in a comment below.

This happens both with Scala 2.9.2 and Scala 2.10.x.

It does not happen with Scala 2.8.2, but we think this is because in Scala 2.8.2 the generic signatures were broken in other ways. Furthermore, it also breaks with 2.8.2 if you change the Java code a bit:

{code}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Func1ReturnString b = new Func1ReturnString() {};
	String s = b.apply();
    }
}
{code}
If you have a base trait with 2 type parameters:

Scala:

{code}
trait Func1[T1, R] {
  def apply(v1: T1): R = null.asInstanceOf[R]
}


class Func1ReturnString[T] extends Func1[T, String]
{code}

Java:

{code}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Func1ReturnString<Integer> b = new Func1ReturnString<Integer>() {};
	b.apply(0);
    }
}
{code}

At runtime:

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Func1ReturnString.apply(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/String;
	at Test.main(Test.java:7)
{code}
I hope you've looked at SI-3452, which AFAICS is this.
Paul: It indeed looks related. I guess you are more versatile with SI-3452 to judge if it's exactly the same issue.
For reference, that commit turns the example in comments into a compile time error, which is better than nothing I guess.  The difference in the generated scala class is:
{noformat}
--- i/Func1ReturnString.class
+++ w/Func1ReturnString.class
@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
 
 Compiled from "S_1.scala"
 public class Func1ReturnString<T> implements Func1<T, java.lang.String> {

     Signature: (Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
     Code:
 ##: aload_1       
{noformat}
That demonstrates the essence of the problem: concrete types cannot be directly substituted for corresponding type parameters in the signatures of mixed in methods, because the underlying concrete implementation will have the erasure of the type parameters, not of the concrete types.

In other words, "Func1" knows nothing of "String", but "Func1ReturnString" thinks it can substitute String for T and everything will work out.  It won't.

It's elaborated on at some length in the commit.

I find that resolution somewhat surprising, because this has little to do with AnyRef specialization or the specialization of Function1.  It is true that specializing Function1 on AnyRef makes it easier to encounter this pre-existing bug, because Function1 is everywhere.  I'm not contesting it, but I hope the bathwater bucket doesn't turn out to have nothing but baby in it.

That sounds painfully optimistic to me.  Even if it were true, it wouldn't make any difference: if we don't work with java, it's our problem no matter where the blame might be pinned.  But I don't think it's true.  Either our signatures/descriptors are wrong/internally-inconsistent or we are missing bridge methods.  I was trying to avoid a new batch of bridge methods when I worked on SI-3452 but maybe they can't be avoided.

Removing {{AnyRef}} specialization of {{Function1}} will be a real pity. Hope it finds its way back.
@Jason: I hope so too. I'll file the patch against 2.10 and revert it in master, so we should be back to normal.

I've had a look at the bugs that concern AnyRef specialization and it's not such a long list: SI-6103, SI-6043, SI-4790, SI-5976 and SI-5583. If we make a big push to fix all of them by the next milestone, maybe we can re-enable the AnyRef specialization.
This bug is related to SI-6101, see:

> Now, Martin said that the issue with mixin cannot be fixed (because it runs after erasure)

"Mixin generates broken code and can't be fixed no matter what" is not a sensible premise from which to analyze this issue.

I recently opened SI-8293 with the plan to add bridges to make this work.

The fix we went for for SI-3452 in 2.11.0, which selectively weakens the generic signatures, is not sufficient to work around this bug.
