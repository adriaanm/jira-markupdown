Compiling the following is enough to cause the compiler to crash:
```scala
class X { object $ }
```

Full stack trace from Scala 2.10.0-RC5 attached.
But I've got you beat by one character, sorry Jon

class X{class $}

When you have to use '$', it's not a bug. I'm glad it fails fast.

You guys can only find these weak 15+ character crashers. I guess I found all the four character crashers years ago... #1215
My original use-case was for string interpolation on a dollar-prefixed string, e.g.
```scala
val money = $"100.00"
```

which, given the paucity of spare symbols on my keyboard, *seems* reasonable to me (bearing in mind I'm selfish)... ;)

And I'm sadly not allowed this either:
```scala
val money = £"100.00"
```
Incidentally,
```scala
class X { object ☹ }
```
works just fine...

But seriously, given that a) this is really really easy to reproduce and b) a compiler crash surely can't be the right answer, can we reopen the issue until someone is prepared to fix it?
Leaving open for the broader issue of name hygiene
NVM, #2806 covers that
