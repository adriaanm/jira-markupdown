Compiling the following is enough to cause the compiler to crash:
{code}
class X { object $ }
{code}

Full stack trace from Scala 2.10.0-RC5 attached.
But I've got you beat by one character, sorry Jon

class X{class $}


When you have to use '$', it's not a bug. I'm glad it fails fast.

You guys can only find these weak 15+ character crashers. I guess I found all the four character crashers years ago... SI-1215
My original use-case was for string interpolation on a dollar-prefixed string, e.g.
{code}
val money = $"100.00"
{code}

which, given the paucity of spare symbols on my keyboard, _seems_ reasonable to me (bearing in mind I'm selfish)... ;)

And I'm sadly not allowed this either:
{code}
val money = £"100.00"
{code}
Incidentally,
{code}
class X { object ☹ }
{code}
works just fine...

But seriously, given that a) this is really really easy to reproduce and b) a compiler crash surely can't be the right answer, can we reopen the issue until someone is prepared to fix it?
Leaving open for the broader issue of name hygiene

NVM, SI-2806 covers that
