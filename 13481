```scala
class A[+T] {
    def x[U >: T](s: U) { }
    def x[U >: T](ss: U*) { }
}

new A[String]().x("a")
```

Compiler reports:
```scala
error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method x in class A of type [U >: String](U*)Unit
and  method x in class A of type [U >: String](U)Unit
match argument types (java.lang.String)
new A[String]().x("a")
                 ^
```

I think first method should be called.

Because of this bug, call to immutable.Stack.push is ambiguous.
