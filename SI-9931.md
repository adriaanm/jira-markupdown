This is documented in https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1377 and we are not sure if this a known change/improvement or bug.

Compiling file [Eval.scala](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/Eval.scala)
Compile errror:

```sbt
[error] core/src/main/scala/cats/Eval.scala:77: overriding value start in class Compute of type () => cats.Eval[this.Start];

Trivial fix:

       case c: Eval.Compute[A] =>

Apologies if this is a false alarm, we do not mind just applying the fix but as Erik says in the issue, it makes sense to let you guys know just in case.
isolated and minimized:

```scala
trait Compute[A] {
  type Start
  val start: Compute[Start]
}

object Test {
  def foo[A](c: Compute[A]): Unit =
    c match {
      case c: Compute[A] =>
        new Compute[A] {
          type Start = c.Start
          val start = c.start
        }
    }
}
```

Perhaps it can be minimized further, but I got stuck here. In particular, I did not succeed in getting rid of the pattern match.

This almost certainly has to do with the changes in type inference for valdefs that came in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5141. As evidence, compiling with 2.12.0-M5 makes the error go away, as does compiling with -Xsource:2.11.
Another way to make this compile is:

```scala
-      case c: Compute[A] =>
+      case d: Compute[A] =>
+        val c = d
```

which certainly makes it seem like it's a pattern-matcher issue.
Here's a variant minimized form (eliminating a type parameter, but introducing a type variable):

```scala
trait Compute[A] {
  type Start
  val start: Compute[Start]
}

object Test {
  def foo(c: Any): Unit =
    c match {
      case c: Compute[a] =>
        new Compute[a] {
          type Start = c.Start
          val start = c.start
        }
    }
}
```

It's not that interestingly different, because in both versions, the type parameter on Compute isn't actually used anywhere. Regardless, as far as I can tell, you do need to have a type parameter in order to trigger the issue. (Throwing away the type member instead makes the issue vanish, too.)
Fascinating! As you know, it compiles ok on 2.11.8,.... **except** when you add `-Xprint:typer`! (In the example below I added -Ydebug for a better error message, but it's otherwise not involved.)

This indicates to me it used to compile due to a latent bug in the old handling of fields. It still doesn't explain why it compiles on Dotty. Still investigating that avenue.

```scala
âžœ  scala git:(2.12.0) ~/scala/scala-2.11.8/bin/scalac /tmp/Eval.scala -Xprint:typer -Ydebug

[...]

              ^

```


```scala
sealed abstract class Eval[+A] {
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Eval[B]): Eval[B] =
    this match {
      case c: Eval.Compute[A] =>
        new Eval.Compute[B] {
          type Start = c.Start
          val start = c.start
        }
    }
}

object Eval {
  sealed abstract class Compute[A] extends Eval[A] {
    type Start
    val start: () => Eval[Start]
  }
}
```
OK that this is pushed to 2.12.1, thanks for thorough investigation.

So just doing some house cleaning: I have added a workaround in [this cats PR](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/1382) - could someone cast a quick eye that the fix is the best for now, please? Then I can leave this for a while...

Thx - Alistair
