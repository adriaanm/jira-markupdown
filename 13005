Define the following method:
```scala
def rec(n: Int): Int = {
  lazy val x = n        
  println(x)            
  if(n < 10) rec(n+1) else n
}
```

If you run `rec(5)`, the following output is produced:
```scala
scala> rec(5)
5
0
0
0
0
0
res4: Int = 10
```

If the `lazy val` is changed to an ordinary `val`, `rec(5)` gives:
```scala
scala> rec(5)                      
5
6
7
8
9
10
res5: Int = 10
```
