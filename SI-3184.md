It would be nice if there was a convenient way to use the continuations plugin from within Eclipse.  The client library is included in the scala library now (for 2.8), but there are still obstacles.  I suggest:
1) Include the compiler plugin "continuations.jar" within the eclipse plugin.
2) Provide an easy (checkbox?) method to enable it.  Currently, a command-line compiler parameter is required, which is not specifiable when using the eclipse plugin.  See http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala/19439

(In r21221) Added support for Int and multi-string compiler switches (elideLevel, Yrecursion, plugin, disable, require, pluginOptions); some cleanup of compiler settings dialog (still pretty gross unfortunately); added support for continuations plugins (set 'P' setting to "continuations:enable"). Fixes SI-3184.
