(extempore in [r25509|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25509]) A conceivably pretty bad performance bug in builders.

SI-4821 pointed out that ArrayBuffer's ++ checks for a cheap size
method by matching on IndexedSeq, but mutable.IndexedSeq, so all
immutable collections are thrown in the same group as linear seqs.
I went looking for other examples of this and found them, in
key classes like Builder.

The "type shadowing trap" is a serious issue in the collections.
Closes SI-4821, no review.
