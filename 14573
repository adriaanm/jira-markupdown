This bug is related to scala/bug#2428 and tested with the snapshot version that fixes scala/bug#2428.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Create a class or object with the name BitSet
 2. Compile the class by saving the file
 3. Delete the BitSet code from the editor and save the file to re-compile (the file now gets deleted as opposed to SI-2428)
 4. Import scala.collection.BitSet

After competing the above steps we get a warning saying **imported BitSet is permanently hidden by definition of class BitSet**.

Doing a clean and a re-build removes the warning message.
