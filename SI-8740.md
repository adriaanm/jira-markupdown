Example below shows the problem:

```scala
trait SomeTag
type @@[+A, T] = A with T
def withSomeTag[A](a: A): A @@ SomeTag  = a.asInstanceOf[A @@ SomeTag]
// def need(a: String @@ SomeTag) = ??? // <- it works
// but this not:
type TypeAlias = String @@ SomeTag
def need(a: TypeAlias) = ???
need(withSomeTag("foo"))
```

Causes:
```scala
<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("foo")
 required: SomeTag with String
              need(withSomeTag("foo"))
```

Changing parameter's type to unaliased version works fine.
Because of this bug, using of scalaz.Tag / shapeless.tag.Tagged is difficult.
Similar to #8709, but with reduced opportunity to deny that it's a bug.
M4 is already a bit late, so we're planning to ship in the next few days once we have SAM support merged. M5 would be possible, though. 

I was never all that happy with my solution, it seemed very arbitrary.

Maybe this version would be a fraction less ugly.

```scala
  def check = parents exists (retry(_, tp2))
  if (tp.isGround)  check
  else suspendingTypeVars(typeVarsInType(tp))(check) else check
```
It'd be great to see this fixed. I was wondering why I hadn't hit it myself, which lead me to a **partial** workaround: 

In the failing example, `TypeAlias` is an alias that refers to another alias `@@`. Ive had success using aliases for tagged types, but Ive always defined directly in terms of unaliased types, eg 
```
type Distance = Int with TagAs.Tagged[DistanceObj.type]

object TagAs {
  trait Tagged[+U]
}
``` 

That is, can't stack 2 aliases over a tagged type, but 1 seems OK.
