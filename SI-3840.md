XMLEventReader can run out of memory on very long input of this type:

{code}
<foo>
  <bar/>
  <bar/>
  <!-- millions more <bar/> -->
</foo>
{code}

This type of input is typical for a table export with lots of rows.

I've traced this back to XMLEventReader.elem which generates dummy <ignore/> tags. These tags are then collected into the parent node in a NodeBuffer. Eventually, the NodeBuffer exhausts the available heap.

(In r23018) Modified XMLEventReader to write dummy <ignore/> tag only once.
