scalac shows a type error when dao.scala is compiled separately from tables.scala, but not when both are compiled together. The Slick-Play sample app is affected by this.

Also see same bug at sbt issue tracker https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/786 .

**reproduce code**
{code:title="tables.scala"}
trait H2Driver{
    abstract class Table[T]
}

object Config {
  val driver : H2Driver = null
  def driver(app: Any): H2Driver = null
}

class Sites extends Config.driver.Table[String]
```scala
{code:title="dao.scala"}
class DAOBase[E]{
  type TableType <: Config.driver.Table[E]
}
class SitesDAO extends DAOBase[String]{
  type TableType = Sites
}
```

**expected**
```
$ scalac -cp . dao.scala tables.scala 
$ scalac -cp . dao.scala
$
```

**actual**
```
$ scalac . dao.scala tables.scala 
$ scalac . dao.scala

dao.scala:5: error: overriding type TableType in class DAOBase with bounds <: Config.driver.Table[String];
 type TableType has incompatible type
  type TableType = Sites
       ^
one error found
$
```
Here's a slightly reduced test case:

https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/7596?expand=1

Within that patch, see `pos/t7596c` for a workaround. Any variation of that will work so long as the prefix for the path dependent types doesn't share a name with overloaded methods.
So if you control the code, a viable workaround would be avoiding overloading. But the overloaded methods could come from a library, in which case as a user you have to fall back to clean/recompilation as described above. (Or submit a PR against the library like https://github.com/freekh/play-slick/pull/53).
