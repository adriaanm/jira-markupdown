The @throws annotation on a primary constructor gets associated with the class instead of a method, and is then ignored when generating bytecode.  A patch which appears sufficient to remedy this is attached.
Annotating the primary constructor is already possible, have a look at the Scala specification, chapter 5.3

```scala
class A @throws(classOf[java.io.IOException]) ()

case class B @throws(classOf[java.io.IOException]) (i: Int)
```
I'm sorry I didn't figure that out.  I realize I shouldn't be relying too much on anything but the spec, but it'd be nice if an example of this syntax could be added to http://www.scala-lang.org/node/106 .  The existing examples all put the annotation on a line by itself (which I did try) but it doesn't parse.

```scala
jon:scala-2.7.2.RC3 paulp$$ cat /tmp/an.scala 
case class B 
@throws(classOf[java.io.IOException])(i: Int)

jon:scala-2.7.2.RC3 paulp$$ bin/scalac /tmp/an.scala 
/tmp/an.scala:2: error: expected start of definition
@throws(classOf[java.io.IOException])(i: Int)
                                     ^
one error found
```
