Given this Java code in ./rrs/Outer.java:
```scala
// package rrs; "Inadvertently" ommitted package declaration

public
class Outer
{
    public
    static
    class InnerS
    {
        public static int twenty_three = 23;
    }
}
```

...and this Scala in ./JavaInner.scala:
```scala
object JavaInner
{
    def
    main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
        printf("rrs.Outer.InnerS.twenty_three=%d%n",
               rrs.Outer.InnerS.twenty_three)
}
```
...and compiling thusly:
```scala
% javac rrs/Outer.java
% scalac -cp . JavaInner.scala
```

The following exception results:

scala.tools.nsc.FatalError: package <empty> does not have a member Outer

(The complete stack trace is attached.)

If the "inadvertently" ommitted package declaration is reinstated, comilation succeeds and the resulting code executes as expected.
