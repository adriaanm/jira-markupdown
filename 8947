Still exists in 2.10.1
Sometimes it can be misleading, for example, I was quite surprised when didn't see any errors on following code snippet (from SO answer http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/15610727/1)

{code}
def Commas(n: Long) = {
if (n >= 1000)
    Commas(n/1000)
{
    print(","+ n%1000/100 + n%100/10 + n%10);
}
 else 
{
    print(n%1000/100 + n%100/10 + n%10);
}
{code}
