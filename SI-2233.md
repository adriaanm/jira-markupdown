The editor preference page has some controls cut of on Mac OS X (see attached file).
The compiler page has a tiny text field for entering a 'location to find compiler plugins' (see attached file)
Yes, I quite agree, these preference pages are quite seriously usability and aesthetically challenged.

It would be wonderful if someone with a good eye for UI design and consistency with the rest of Eclipse could volunteer some time to improve things here.

I think this ticket is partially a duplication of SI-129.

Also, about the tiny text field there should be a "browser folders" button too.
