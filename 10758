`GenTraversableOnce` is now a universal trait, meaning it now extends `Any` rather than `AnyRef` can be a parent of a value class.

This has a unintended interaction with structural types:
```scala
trait T extends Any {
  def size: Int
}
object Test {
  type Structural = { def size: Int }
  def foo(x: T): Structural = x
}
```
```
 found   : x.type (with underlying type T)
 required: Test.Structural
    (which expands to)  AnyRef{def size: Int}
  def foo(x: T): Structural = x
                              ^
```

Because of this, your the result of `ev(gto)` is itself adapted with the very same implicit view that it defines. (We need a lint rule for that!)
```scala
    // -Xprint:typer
    implicit def hasSize[T](gto: T)(implicit ev: T => scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[_]): Test.Structural = {
      val temp: scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[Any] = ev.apply(gto);
      Test.this.hasSize[scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[Any]](temp)(scala.this.Predef.$conforms[scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce[Any]])
    };
```

Workaround:
```scala
type Structural = Any { def size: Int }
```

(The "naked" `{def size: Int}` is a shorthand for `AnyRef { def size: Int}`)
