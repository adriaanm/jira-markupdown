An example from the mailing lists:
```scala

sealed trait EntityRef {
  type RefId
}

trait ProductRef extends EntityRef {
  type RefId = Boolean
}

object SomeAction {
  implicit def rootRef2Id[T <: EntityRef](ref: T): ref.RefId = ???
  def handle(c: ProductRef) {
     locally(c: Boolean)
  }
} 

Implicit search approximates the type of `rootRef2Id` as `(?) => ?#RefId`. This happens here in Implicits.scala [1].

I have added this example to SI-6139 [2]. It is unlikely we'll touch this in 2.11, so you might need to pursue a different approach.
