I applied the patch. In my opinion there is a bug in the TPTP library too. Verification does not require that the stack is empty before a return. The error message seems strange, since the code is linear, so we can't have two different stacks at a merge point. Maybe the library instruments the code and makes some invalid assumptions. Anyway, the {{DUP}} was useless so it's good to have fixed this.
