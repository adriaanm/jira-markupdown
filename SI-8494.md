Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the filtering options for :javap don't seem to work at all anymore.  (They used to.)

Dude, don't you have any tests at all?

Well, they test for presence, not absence.  That's the usual attempt to avoid breaking when code gen changes.

But you could test that filtering results in less output than not filtering, as a sanity check.
