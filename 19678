I've got {{-Xfatal-warnings}};

{code:scala}
case class PersonInfo(id: Option[ParticipantId],
                      gender: String,
                      rankPayEtc: Unit,
                      maritalStatus: String)
{code}

I'm getting the (fatal) error:
{{comparing values of types Unit and Unit using `==' will always yield true}}

(a) I know that.  
(b) The warning is misleading, since I didn't use {{==}}; it's auto-generated.  
(c) How can I suppress this (fatal) warning?
