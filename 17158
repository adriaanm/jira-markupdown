There is no subclass of {{scala.tools.partest.DirectTest}} to compare javap for output classfiles (as generated by {{-Ygen-javap}}).

That's necessary to test, for example, whether certain JVM attributes are being emitted (motivation: SI-5983)

In case javap is not available on the machine running {{partest}}, ASM's {{scala.tools.asm.util.Textifier}} could be used instead (via GenASM).
