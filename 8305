Ok, here's the issue:

{code}
package org.specs2
package control


trait LanguageFeatures {
  implicit val implicitsAreAllowed = language.implicitConversions
  implicit val postfixOpsAreAllowed = language.postfixOps
}

trait NoLanguageFeatures extends LanguageFeatures {
  override implicit val implicitsAreAllowed = language.implicitConversions
  override implicit val postfixOpsAreAllowed = language.postfixOps
}

{code}


These should be lazy vals, not vals, which is a huge tax to impose on implementers really.  I can update the documentation, then I'm going to mark this as "won't fix" for now.    We may want to think about warning the exact situation where a user assigns a language feature to a val or var.
