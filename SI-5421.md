```scala
scala> class A {def t: Int = {println("getter"); -282}; def t_=(p: Int) { println("setter") }; def m(v: String) = new A}
defined class A

scala> val a = new A
a: A = A@46aea8cf

scala> a m "txt" t = 18; println("x")

scala> 
```

the "setter" is not called, neither the println.


then,

```scala

scala> val s = "txt"
s: String = txt

scala> a m s t = 18; println("x")
setter
x
getter
a.m(s).t: Int = -282

scala>
```

the "getter" is called, and there's a definition "a.m(s).t: Int", Ã©trange.
This has the form:
```scala
scala> var x = 0
x: Int = 0

scala> x = 1 ; println(x)
1
x: Int = 1
```
The last line reports the var that was set by the assignment.

If the LHS is side-effecting, you'll see it twice.

```scala
scala> class A(s: String) { var _t = -1 ; println(s"A $s!"); def t: Int = {println("getter"); _t}; def t_=(p: Int) { println(s"setter $p"); _t = p }; def m(v: String) = new A(v)} 
defined class A

scala> val a = new A("hi")
A hi!
a: A = A@1f97cf0d

scala> a m "txt" t = 18; println("x")
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
A txt!
setter 18
x
A txt!
getter
a.m("txt").t: Int = -1
```
On 2.10.0, it looks like there was a quoting bug that was later fixed:
```scala
scala> a m "txt" t = 18; println("x")
warning: there were 1 feature warnings; re-run with -feature for details
<console>:10: error: ')' expected but string literal found.
 + "a.m("txt").t: Int = " + `$ires0` + "\n" 
         ^
```
