Regressed in: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/35209fc

Might also be linked to the "boxity" of fast track macros.

I reckon changing:

{code}
def f(args: Any*): String = macro ???
{code}

to:

{code}
def f[A](args: A*): String = macro ???
{code}

Might alter behaviour. We experienced similar subtleties with quasiquotes.
It actually happens in 2.10 too:
{code}
$ scalac-hash v2.10.0 sandbox/test.scala
sandbox/test.scala:2: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Any
 required: Double
   f"${if (true) 3.5 else 2.5}%.2f"
       ^
one error found
$ cat sandbox/test.scala
object Test {
   f"${if (true) 3.5 else 2.5}%.2f" // note the difference with the one in the description
}
{code}
The case as described regressed in M3.

I think I still have my "I'm a lubber not a typer" t-shirt from back then.

The case with non-identical alternatives, and who ever needs that, is being unassigned and kicked down the road to foster work stealing...

I don't suppose we could change the title?  I lose three months' life expectancy every time I see "regression in f interpolator."

There was a very similar issue with quasiquotes. 

The quick solution for this is to change f interpolator signature from current:
{code}
def f(args: Any*): String = macro ???
{code}
to:
{code}
def f[T](args: T*): String = macro ???
{code}
It will force typer not to be lazy and properly infer specific types to arguments of the interpolator. At least this is how quasiquotes implementation works around this issue.

I guess you guys know what you're talking about (because I don't know what *I'm* talking about), but I might like to supply hetero args:
{code}
scala> f"${3.14}%f rounds to ${3}%d"
<console>:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Double(3.0)
 required: Int
              f"${3.14}%f rounds to ${3}%d"
                                      ^
{code}
But FTR, I was prepared to apply whatever snake oil greases the wheel.

The way I expect it to work is following:

1. User calls f interpolator with heterogeneous arguments:
{code}
StringContext(...).f(1, 2.0, 'three)
{code}
2. Typer infers useless type for T
{code}
StringContext(...).f[Any](1, 2.0, 'three)
{code}
3. Macro comes and inspects .tpe of the arguments completely disregarding inferred T. 

This way tpes should get attributed with proper concrete types rather than Any. I don't expect any problems wrt heterogeneous arguments. 
The 3 is promoted early to 3.0.

However, it seems to work by asking for a more usefully useless inferred type:
{code}
def f[A >: Any](args: A*): String = macro ???

scala> f"${3.14}%f rounds to ${3}%d"
res0: String = 3.140000 rounds to 3
{code}

Thanks again for the extra words.

Of course, -Xlint will warn you about the uselessly inferred type, even if it's useful.

You don't want to -Xlint:-warn-any,_ whenever you interpolate.
