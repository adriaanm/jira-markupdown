See the following.  TreeMap works, HashMap doesn't:

```scala
cala> var m = Map.empty[Int, Int]                                 
m: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,Int] = Map()

scala> for(i <- 1 until 40000; j <- 1 until 500) m = m.update(j, i)

Surprisingly, it's not!

Or rather, it is. But it's only a bug in the implementation in that it fails to work around an issue with the compiler.

What's happening here is as follows:

As you presumably know, HashMap has this field "later". The idea is that old copies reference newer ones, but newer ones don't reference older ones. This means that you can view the older ones as patches against the newer ones, but the newer ones don't prevent the old copies from being garbage collected. When you perform an update against a freshly created immutable.HashMap, you get the contents of this "later" field.

Here's the code that initializes later:

```scala
 	  private def markUpdated(key: A, ov: Option[B], delta: Int) {
 	    val lv = loadFactor
 	    later = new HashMap[A, B] {
 	      override def initialSize = 0
 	      override def loadFactor = lv       
 	      table     = HashMap.this.table
 	      tableSize = HashMap.this.tableSize
 	      threshold = HashMap.this.threshold
 	    }
 	    oldKey = key
 	    oldValue = ov
 	    deltaSize = delta
 	  }

```

The problem: later is being created as an anonymous inner class. And the Scala compiler passes a reference to the enclosing class as a field of the inner class, regardless of whether it needs it (I though thtere was a ticket about this, but I can't find it). Consequently the newly updated HashMap references the old HashMap, as well as the old HashMap referencing the newly updated HashMap, so the entire thing is retained in memory. 
Fixed in r15029, as suggested -- i.e. by removing outer reference in inner class when it is unused.
