There is an issue on overloading. I use RC3, REPL, and Netbeans.

I simplified everything and use two methods

```scala
def foo(x: Double, a: Double*)= println("first")
def foo(f: Int, a: Double= 1.0)= println("second")
```

======
Here the REPL session (I re-entered the first foo
and the end of the session):

```scala

Esser-MacBook:~ friedrichesser$$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.RC3 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_20).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def foo(x: Double, a: Double*)= println("first")
foo: (x: Double,a: Double*)Unit

scala> def foo(f: Int, a: Double= 1.0)= println("second")
foo: (f: Int,a: Double)Unit

scala> foo(1.0)
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Double(1.0)
 required: Int
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
       foo(1.0)
           ^

scala> foo(1)
second

scala> foo(1.0,1.0)
<console>:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Double(1.0)
 required: Int
       foo(1.0,1.0)

scala> def foo(x: Double, a: Double*)= println("first")    
foo: (x: Double,a: Double*)Unit

scala> foo(1.0)
first

scala> foo(1)
first

scala>
```
====

Here is Netbeans (same environment):

```scala

  def foo(x: Double, a: Double*)= println("first")
  def foo(f: Int, a: Double= 1.0)= println("second")

  def test = {
    foo(1.0)
    foo(f=1)
    foo(1)
    foo(x=1.0)
  }

the console output is:

first
second
first
first

```

you can't define overloads in the repl that way; the second definition of foo hides the first. try

```scala
object o {
  def foo(x: Double, a: Double*)= println("first")
  def foo(f: Int, a: Double= 1.0)= println("second")
}
import o._
```

Did you looked at the output in Netbeans? 

REPL was just my second go, and I did not
know, that there is such a restriction (thanks for that!).


in Scala 2.7 the output is:

```scala

first
second
second
first

```

as expected. Why you changed that from 2.7 to 2.8?

foo(1) does not call the second foo in Scala 2.8!

The current behavior is correct; defaults are only used if the application without defaults is not possible. In "foo(1)", the first method can be called without any default arguments.
Note on this change from 2.8 Beta to 2.8 RC3!

This is very "intuitive":

```scala
  def foo(x: Double, a: Double*)= println("first")
  def foo(f: Char, a: Char='a')= println("second")
```

as calling

```scala
foo('c')  // console-output: first
```

works "as expected".
