this is good:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_17).
scala> new collection.mutable.GenericArray[Int](1).head
res16: Int = 0
```

but this is not so good:
```scala
scala> new collection.mutable.GenericArray[Int](1).toString
res17: String = GenericArray(null)
```

The "null" seems like an implementation detail that shouldn't leak out like this.

(Whether the Array[AnyRef] used internally by GenericArray ought to be initialized to contain a bunch of boxed integers instead of a bunch of nulls, or whether it ought to be toString's job to hide the difference, I don't know.)
