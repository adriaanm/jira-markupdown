This idea for enhancement comes from the [http://www.adobe.com/livedocs/flex/2/langref/ Flex 2 API] for Flash development. Here they include both language specification and additional documentation with the standard libary api, browsable from the "package" section. Maybe something similar could be done for Scala by including pointers to Scala's numerous external documentation like [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections.html The Scala 2.8 Collections API] and language specification?
I guess that's [the docs site|http://docs.scala-lang.org] that you're looking for.
