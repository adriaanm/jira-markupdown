Another kind of gap is operations that don't fail at runtime, but don't give view-like behavior, either. For example, scanLeft on a SeqView is eager in both 2.9.2 and 2.10.0:

{noformat}
scala> List.range(1, 5).view.scanLeft(0){case (a, b) => println(b); a + b}
1
2
3
4
res4: scala.collection.SeqView[Int,Seq[_]] = SeqViewC(...)
{noformat}
