I've also run this problem with Protobuf generated code. A workaround for this issue is to modify the generated Java code with the full path to Builder
```scala
public QueueMessage.Stage.Builder toBuilder() { return newBuilder(this); }
```

However, it's a pain to have to tweak generated code. I'd like to see this bug fixed.
