There are very good use cases for implicits with by-name parameters. Look for instance at how we add ::# to Streams, or consider the Scala equivalent of Ruby's unless.

Generally, I don't believe we should have many cases of warnings, or options that control them. If people care about certain issues, there's a possibility to write a lint-like tool, maybe as a plugin.
