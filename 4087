Ok, I did a bit more testing - Iterator.{{take}}, for example, does not advance the iterator for lists either until the resulting iterator is actually used, while {{drop}} does.

Is the state of an Iterator after take, drop, takeWhile, dropWhile, etc. undefined? If so, close this bug, but it should added to the the documentation.
