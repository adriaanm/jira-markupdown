Minim case:

There is a Java interface A:

public interface A<T extends String> {
   void run(T t);
}

Which has a type parameter <T extends String> and abstract method run(T t)

And a Java abstract class B with is sub-class of A. But, B, as it,
omitted type parameter of A. This is unsafe but valid in Java:

public abstract class B implements A {
   public String me() {
       return "I'm B";
   }
}


Assume above class A and B have been compiled under javac, and packed
as jar library, and I can not patch it anymore. Now I need to write a
class S in Scala which extends B:

class S extends B {
   override
   def run[T <: String](t:T) = {println(t)}
}

scalac complained as:
/Users/dcaoyuan/NetBeansProjects/ScalaTestCase/src/S.scala:1: error:
class S needs to be abstract, since method run in trait A of type
(T)Unit is not defined
class S extends B {
/Users/dcaoyuan/NetBeansProjects/ScalaTestCase/src/S.scala:3: error:
method run overrides nothing
   def run[T <: String](t:T) = {println(t)}

I than tried  "forSome" type:

class S extends B {
   override
   def run(t:T forSome {type T <: String}) = {println(t)}
}

Again, I got:
/Users/dcaoyuan/NetBeansProjects/ScalaTestCase/src/S.scala:1: error:
class S needs to be abstract, since method run in trait A of type
(T)Unit is not defined
class S extends B {
/Users/dcaoyuan/NetBeansProjects/ScalaTestCase/src/S.scala:3: error:
method run overrides nothing
   def run(t:T forSome {type T <: String}) = {println(t)}

It seems that, since B omitted A's type parameter T, I have no way to
get what is T, and can not successfully override/implement "run(T t)"
method.

I tried other forms of "forSome" usages, and always failed.
Yes, it can be implemented in Java, use "String" is enough:

public class JS extends B {
    public void run(String t) {
        System.out.println(t);
    }
}

Scala does not understand raw types. This is some of the ``baggage_ that we dropped from Java. When Scala sees a raw type it treats it as an existential. Unfortunately, that means that in the case above class B extends A with *some unknown* type parameter T. Since T is unknown, we can't implement a run method with this type. So we are stuck.

The only thing one can do in these situations is implement a subclass in Java that implements the method. I'm afraid there's nothing else we can do without introducing raw types into Scala. And the latter we want to avoid.
There seems to be a workaround for the simpler case:
{code}
public interface A<T extends String> {
    T get();
}

public abstract class B implements A {}

class C extends B {
    this: A[_] =>
    def get = "foo"
}
{code}

If we could actually refer to the existential type used in the self type, this could probably also be used to work around the original issue.
