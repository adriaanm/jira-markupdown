As of r22631, the REPL in quick is broken/misconfigured in some way. For example, try:

{code}
build$$ quick/bin/scala

import scala.xml._
def x(n: Node): Node =
  n match {
    case <d>{_}</d> => <d>abc</d>
    case other => other
  }
{code}

The result is a pretty exotic crash involving typer errors and exceptions. In the middle appears the following:

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: class file needed by ParIterableLike is missing.
reference value forkjoin of package concurrent refers to nonexisting symbol.
        at scala.reflect.generic.UnPickler$$Scan.errorMissingRequirement(UnPickler.scala:754)
        at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$CompileScan.errorMissingRequirement(UnPickler.scala:43)
        at scala.tools.nsc.symtab.classfile.UnPickler$$CompileScan.errorMissingRequirement(UnPickler.scala:28)
{code}

In all likelihood, forkjoin is simply missing from a path somewhere.
(In r23523) ant, build.xml and classpath issues.  It looks like everyone has
been ignoring their painstakingly set classpaths and using whatever
they can find in the vicinity of the scala script, which works OK
for pack but not so well for quick.

I also added a build.xml feature so you can drop jars into a dir and
have them automatically used everywhere.  The directory is lib/extra.
Pro tip: add lib/extra to .gitignore and put jars like
yjp-controller-api-redist.jar in there.

Closes SI-3706, no review.
