Trying to compile the following code:

```scala
object W {
  implicit def tuple2[A: W, B: W]: W[(A, B)] = new W[(A, B)] {}
}
trait W[P]

class WC[T1: W, T2: W, T3: W]() {
  val wc = implicitly[
    W[((T3, T1), T2)]
  ]
}
```

yields the following compiler error:

```scala
OC.scala:27: diverging implicit expansion for type W[((T3, T1), T2)]
starting with value evidence$9 in class WC
  val wc = implicitly[
                     ^
```

This is probably a bug, because when I change the WC class to a method, it compiles without errors: 

```scala
object WC {
  def wc[T1: W, T2: W, T3: W]() = 
    implicitly[W[((T3, T1), T2)]]
}
```

The error can be also fixed by changing WC to: 

```scala
class WC[T1: W, T2: W, T3: W]() {
  val wc = implicitly[
    W[((T3, T1), T2)]
  ](W.tuple2[(T3, T1), T2](implicitly, implicitly))
}
```


This error is probably the reason, why Ordering with nested tuples can not be implicitly constructed in classes:

```scala
class OC[T1: Ordering, T2: Ordering]() {
  val ordering = implicitly[
    Ordering[((Int, T1), T2)]
  ] // /* uncommenting the following fixes the compile error */ (Ordering.Tuple2[(Int, T1), T2](implicitly, implicitly))
}
```
