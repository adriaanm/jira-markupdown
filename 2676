note that this particular issue is fixed, but the test case includes a Scala method that could be given a more precise java generic sig

currently, the `withFilter` method in `HashMap`:
```scala
trait TraversableLike[+A, +Repr] {
  class WithFilter(p: A => Boolean)
  def withFilter(p: A => Boolean): WithFilter = new WithFilter(p)
}

class HashMap[K, +V] extends TraversableLike[(K, V), HashMap[K, V]]
```

becomes:
```scala
public class HashMap<K, V> implements TraversableLike<Tuple2<K, V>, HashMap<K, V>>, ScalaObject {
  public TraversableLike.WithFilter withFilter(Function1 p) { return TraversableLike.class.withFilter(this, p);
```

a more precise type would obviously include type params for `TraversableLike` and `Function1`
