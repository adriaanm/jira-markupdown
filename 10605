We can't warn in general here as you can make this valid with an early initializer:
```scala
scala> val bar = new { val x = 3 } with Foo
bar: Foo = $anon$1@7daf3aa0

scala> bar.f()
res1: Int = 3
```

We might be able to get a check for this into a profile of a linter, especially one that can assume a "closed world", ie it can assume it knows all subclasses of the trait. But that would be a tool outside of the compiler itself.
