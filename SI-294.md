Please add support for nested Java annotations. Here is my guess at what the syntax might be, using the JPA annotations for example:
```scala
import javax.persistence._

@Entity
class Test {
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable { val joinColumns = Array(@JoinColumn{val name = "a name"}) }
    var test: String = _
}
```
In this example, the nested annotation is in an array value, but they should also be supported as single values:
{{@MyAnnotation { val test = @MyOtherAnnotation }}}

Here is a related [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.scala/8768 mailing list thread]. This feature is very important for interoperating with Java libraries, and I don't know of any current workaround.
Hi. To me it seems that a special case of nested Annotations is still not working. It happens when a Scala annotation (i.e. a StaticAnnotation) contains a Java annotation, which contains named arguments (any annotation with more than one "value" argument)
```scala
class NestedAnnotationTest {
        // all of these work
	@ComplexJavaAnnotation(nested= new NestedJavaAnnotation2(arg="test"))
	@ComplexScalaAnnotation1(arg1=42, arg2="test")
	@ComplexScalaAnnotation2(nested = new NestedJavaAnnotation1(23))
	// this one throws "too many arguments for constructor NestedJavaAnnotation2"
        @ComplexScalaAnnotation2(nested = new NestedJavaAnnotation2(arg="test"))
	val field:int = 3;
}
```
Of course, NestedJavaAnnotation2 just looks like this
```scala
public @interface NestedJavaAnnotation2 {
	public String arg();
}
```

I tried to implement the TargetedAnnotation from #1846, but for this I need to put complex java annotations inside a scala annotation.
Hi,

nesting a java annotation inside a scala StaticAnnotation is not allowed (I'll have to improve the error message). The reason is that arguments to scala annotations are type checked just like any other code. So if you write

```scala
@ScalaAnnotation(new JavaAnnotation(arg1 = 1, arg2 = "two"))
```

you will get an error

```scala
"too many arguments for constructor JavaAnnotation"
```

which is correct; the java annotation class does not have such a constructor. The reason why it works for non-nested java annotations is that we "abuse" the constructor / named arguments syntax for creating java annotations, so we don't actually type check it as an ordinary constructor call in that case.

We can't do the same special case for nested java annotations because we would have to generate an incorrect tree.
