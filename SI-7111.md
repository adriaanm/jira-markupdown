This old email sums it up.
```scala
// Only ONE CLASSFILE no matter how many Bippies!
// Contrast with "object B1 extends Bippy", where we
// end up with two classes (B1 and B1$) per node.
object enum {
  // Oh, we can't make Bippy abstract else every instance has to be a subclass
  // A private constructor will have to suffice to "seal" it.
  sealed class Bippy private[enum] ()

  final val B1 = new Bippy   // infers B1.type
  final val B2 = new Bippy   // infers B2.type
  final val B3 = new Bippy   // infers B3.type

  // Now what we need is for scala to notice that Bippy is sealed
  // with a constructor which can only be invoked from this file, and
  // thus deduce that its *instances* are sealed - and we do not
  // need to cover "Bippy", only B1.type, B2.type, B3.type.

  def f(x: Bippy) = x match {
    case B1 => 1  // B1.type is covered
    case B2 => 2  // B2.type is covered
  }

  // hypothetically speaking
  warning: match may not be exhaustive.
  It would fail on the following input: B3
    def f(x: Bippy) = x match {
                      ^ }
}
```
Note that this opportunity is strongly linked to #785, because at present only "objects" are privileged in the pattern matcher such that "case B1" is equivalent to type matching on B1.type. The val-defined instances of B1, B2, B3, despite having singleton types, are treated as arbitrary values upon which equals will be called and about which nothing is known. This needlessly eliminates the possibility of having a fully functional enumerated type which requires only one class definition.
The sealedness doesn't prevent others from making additional singleton types.

The following should be exhaustive, but the types can't convey that.

```scala
import enum._
val B4 = (B3: Bippy)
def m(b: B) = b match {
  case _: B1.type | _: B2.type | _: B4.type =>
}
```

It seems like we would need fully blown uniqueness types for this scheme to work.
