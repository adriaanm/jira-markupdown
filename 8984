Also, Foo#bar filters for member bar, and -fun Foo#bar shows anonfuns pertaining to bar, while -fun Foo# shows all funs for Foo but filters for apply (since that is often the member of interest).  -app Test# shows the apply of the DelayedInit, i.e., the init code proper. After a def m, javap #m shows only m.
