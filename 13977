I have some code like this:

----------

package com.apple.store.scalapreso

import java.math.BigInteger

object BigIntExample2 {
  
// ...
  
}

----------

and there is a red error "X" next to the import statement and when I hover over it, it says "value math is not a member of package com.apple.java".

I created a new package com.foo.bar.splee and pasted the same code in and changed the package line and it didn't report the problem there.

Interestingly the Package Explorer has BigIntExample2.scala with a "J" icon and not an "S" icon!
