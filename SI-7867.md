Scaladoc defines a `NodeSpecRegex` used to parse qname globs in various `@contentDiagram` and `@inheritanceDiagram` incantations ([DiagramDirectiveParser:153](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.3/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/doc/model/diagram/DiagramDirectiveParser.scala#L153)). This regex rejects all symbolic/unicode identifiers, as well as identifiers containing numerals.

For example, `/** @contentDiagram hideNodes "F2" */` produces the following error:
```scala
Could not understand diagram annotation in package basis.math: unmatched entry "hideNodes "F2"".
  This could be because:
   - you forgot to separate entries by commas
   - you used a tag that is not allowed in the current context (like @contentDiagram hideSuperclasses)
   - you did not use one of the allowed tags (see docs.scala-lang.org for scaladoc annotations)
```
