(extempore in [r25459|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25459]) Fix for a bug in CharArrayReader which made triple quoted strings
fail to parse sometimes. Note: when the temptation strikes to adjust
for special cases by letting the regular case happen and subsequently
attempting to fix the ball of mutation by selectively applying what
seems like the inverse operation, please consider the possibility that
this is not the optimal approach. Closes SI-4785, no review.
