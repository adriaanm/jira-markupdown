I'm closing this wontfix unless someone wants to mount an argument to the contrary.  Triple quoted strings are specced to end on a triple quote, and that's what it's doing - special casing it to look for a quadruple quote and change its behavior is ugly at best.  It's also impossible to put a """ inside a triple quoted string.  Any quoting mechanism is going to have some edges, and the one in this ticket is very easy to work around:
```scala
scala> println("""This a "raw" string ending with a "double quote""" + "\"")
This a "raw" string ending with a "double quote"
```
