I think that's the way it's meant to behave. Still, the language spec says otherwise:


*Method equals: (Any)Boolean is structural equality, where two instances are equal if they both belong to the case class in question and they have equal (with respect to equals) constructor arguments.* ([Scala Language Reference|http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaReference.pdf], page 68)

It should probably say constructor arguments in the first parameter section.
