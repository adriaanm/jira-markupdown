Partial diagnosis: the {{VerifyError}} goes away when {{scala.reflect.internal.BaseTypeSeqs$BaseTypeSeq.typeError}} is emitted from a modified version:

{noformat}
    private def typeError(msg: String): TypeError =
      new TypeError(
        "the type intersection "+(parents mkString " with ")+" is malformed"+
        "\n --- because ---\n"+msg)
{noformat}

(its callsites updated to read "{{throw typeError(...}}"). With those changes, the result of that method can be stored into a local var, just like {{InlineExceptionHandlers}} wants. 

Therefore it's not a GenASM bug.
