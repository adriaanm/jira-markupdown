The {{:javap -fun C}} command shows the content of (some?) anonymous function declared in C, except for C itself. Its implementation assumes "anonfun" to be found in the class name, which is no longer true since https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/63207e1.

luc$ qs -Ydelambdafy:method
Welcome to Scala version 2.11.3-20141010-082147-3e0164d7be (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_65).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> class C { def f = List(1).map(_ + 1) }
defined class C

scala> :javap -fun C
Failed: No anonfuns found.
{code}
An approximation, perhaps.

The feature intends to save the user from drilling down into closure implementations.  For -Ydelambdafy:inline, it examines the anonfun classes for C.  For method, it looks at lamba classes and follows the invokestatic of accessors to select the anonfun methods of C.

So -fun C selects all closures in C, -fun C#f closures in method f.
