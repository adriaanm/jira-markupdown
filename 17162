(Using Manifests to avoid interacting with scala/bug#5990.)
```scala
def isItInferableAsATypeArg[A : Manifest](f: A => Unit) = manifest[A]

object Repeated extends ((Int*) => Unit) {
  def apply(x: Int*) {}
}

object ByName extends ((=> Int) => Unit) {
  def apply(x: => Int) {}
}

isItInferableAsATypeArg(Repeated)
```
```
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Repeated.type
 required: Seq[Int] => Unit
```

Okay, so no then!
```scala
isItInferableAsATypeArg(ByName)
```
```
error: No Manifest available for => Int.
```

Okay, so yes then?

Somewhere in here is a bug, right?
