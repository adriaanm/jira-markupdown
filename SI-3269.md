If you provide an empty iterator to `++`, when iteration reaches the end, the expression which generated the last iterator is re-evaluated every time `hasNext` is called.

{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r21356-b20100407020120 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_18).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> List(1).iterator ++ { println("Hello"); Iterator.empty }
res0: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator

scala> res0.hasNext
res1: Boolean = true

scala> res0.next()
res2: Int = 1

scala> res0.hasNext
Hello
res3: Boolean = false

scala> res0.hasNext
Hello
res4: Boolean = false
{code}

This only happens if the second iterator is empty; if it isn't, `it`, the local forced copy of `that`, is assigned to `cur` and the evaluation never happens again.

(In r21383) Fix and test for Iterator corner case.  Closes SI-3269, no review.
