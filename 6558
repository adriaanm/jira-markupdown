Thanks Mark,

My sincere apologies for using the incorrect forum.  I over-simplified the problem to the point it was no longer a correct description.  I have since determined that (in the unsimplified code) I was incorrectly relying on the ValidatorHandler obtained from javax.xml.validation.Schema.newValidatorHandler, which was passing attribute values to its ContentHandler without normalizing their values, as I was expecting (since by its name and otherwise, generally, its behaviour, it is a validating processor).  By switching to use SchemaFactory.newSAXParser (with appropriate configuration of the factory), I can obtain the desired behaviour.

All of this is obviously outside the realms of Scala, but thought I'd note it here in case my initial comment started anyone else down a time-wasting path.

Regards,
Anthony
