This code is actually incorrect, and before the infinite loop, an error is printed:

{code}
error: only classes can have declared but undefined members
         type t
              ^
{code}

I imagine that the error situation breaks an assumption that is later used in the implementation of typeSymbol (i.e. that normalising a type alias does not yield the same type).
