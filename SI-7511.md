For instance, take `1L.abs`:

Instead of just computing and returning the result (like it is done in `RichInt`), this is what happens:

- `RichLong` inherits `abs` by extending `ScalaNumberProxy\[T\]`
- `ScalaNumberProxy\[T\]` has an abstract `protected implicit def num: Numeric\[T\]`
- This method is implemented in `RichLong` and points to `scala.math.Numeric.LongIsIntegral`
- The actual method `abs` now calls `num.abs(self)`

Same story for `doubleValue`, `floatValue`, `longValue`, `intValue`, `byteValue`, `shortValue`, `min`, `max`, `signum`.

Rex benchmarked it and it seems to make a significant difference: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/t2DndCtkhlw/zkgl1lVStu4J
