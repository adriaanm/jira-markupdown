`Iterator(5).indexOf(5,0)` does not work.  In fact, every call to the two-arg version of `indexOf` seems to return -1.  I presume the iterator is being consumed completely instead of partially.
It seems `Iterator` doesn't have a two-arg version of `indexOf`. The two arg version present in other collections comes from `GenSeqLike`, which `Iterator` does not implement:

```scala
def indexOf[B >: A](elem: B, from: Int): Int = indexWhere(elem == _, from)
```

When `indexOf` is called on an `Iterator` with two arguments, the compiler is converting it to a call to the one-arg version with a tuple argument:

```scala
scala> Iterator(5 -> 0).indexOf(5,0)
res0: Int = 0
```
@Ichoran I'll add the new method to `Iterator` and create a pull request for `2.12.x`. Is that ok with you?
Note - I have not contributed to scala or the collections library at all.

I've noticed that other Iterator.scala code, as well as your PR, @Rui, included var's.

Why not implement `indexWhere` in a functional way? Something like:

```scala
  override def indexWhere[B >: A](p: A => Boolean, from: Int): Int = 
   self.zipWithIndex.drop(from).find(p(_._1)) match {
      case None             => -1
      case Some((_, index)) => index
    } 
```

Note - I don't know if `self` is correct here. But this REPL examples shows a few simple examples working:

```scala
scala> Iterator(1,2,3).zipWithIndex.drop(0).find(_._1 == 3)
res2: Option[(Int, Int)] = Some((3,2))
```
