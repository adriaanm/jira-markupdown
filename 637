again, a duplicate of scala/bug#445... (I know, I'm beginning to sound like a broken record)

an implicit with a type constructor parameter requires type constructor inference, which we do not support. scala/bug#445 essentially says that the compiler should report an error whenever a type constructor argument is omitted (and maybe we should emit a warning for implicit methods with type constructor parameters, as they will never successfully be inserted implicitly)

If someone feels up to the task of spec'ing a simple form of type constructor inference and implementing it, please do! (I don't even know the type inferencer well enough to overcome my fear of going in and  implementing scala/bug#445 as a quick fix.. I should get around to it after the POPL deadline, though.)
