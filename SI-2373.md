I'm trying to run version 2.7.6.final from command line (cmd.exe) on Windows Vista 64-bit (with 64-bit Hotspot JVM).  If I run scala with no command line args, then it works fine.  However, if I specify a command line argument, it doesn't work:

{code}
C:\dev\java\HelloWorldScala\src>scala -e "println(\"Hello\")"
{code}

Scala doesn't respond (for several minutes).  If I check Task Manager, I find a number of java.exe processes spun up, with more being created as time passes.  Eventually, when I exit with Ctrl-C, I get the following:

{code}
C:\dev\java\HelloWorldScala\src>scala -e "println(\"Hello\")"
Terminate batch job (Y/N)?
{code}

I also get this behavior if I put the println("Hello") in a script file called !HelloWorld.scala.  The following code fails (hangs):


{code}
C:\dev\java\HelloWorldScala\src>scala HelloWorld.scala
{code}

However, if I use the :load option within scala, it works fine:

{code}
C:\dev\java\HelloWorldScala\src>scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.6.final (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_12).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :load HelloWorld.scala
Loading HelloWorld.scala...
Hello

scala>

...
{code}

Maybe I'm doing something wrong here, but I really don't see how.

I tested a fresh installation of Vista x64, using JDK 6 update 17. To be on the safe side, I installed Java in a path with no whitespaces (just in case). The command line provided prints "hello" as expected with both 2.7.7 and a recent 2.8.0 nightly. All seems to work. I am closing the ticket, please let me know if you still encounter this problem.
