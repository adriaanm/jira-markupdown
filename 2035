_then you need to increase the maximum size of the thread pool by specifying -Dactors.maxPoolSize=X, with X greater or equal to the number of active receive-based actors you want._

Thanks, good to know - where should I have found this in the documentation?

However, in my opinion sth is wrong: when I run the "receive"-version in 2.7.5, there is simply no progress even with only few actors, while the "react" version works fine - see the log or just try it. Or did I misunderstood some other fundamental difference between receive and react?
