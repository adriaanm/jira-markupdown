By way of example:

```scala
object TestMe {
  def returnsPrimitive(x: Int): Int = x

  def testme() {
    val nonTrivialCondition = 42
    if (nonTrivialCondition == 42) {
      returnsPrimitive(5)
    }
    else {
      Unit
    }
    Unit
  }
}
```

Even though the value of the if-then-else branch is unused, it boxes the integer returned by returnsPrimitive().

```scala
public void testme();
    flags: ACC_PUBLIC

Presumably, this boxing could be eliminated?
This is not related to specialization. 

The root of the problem is stack discipline: the if expression leaves an Int on the stack for the true branch and Unit for the false branch. They're common supertype is Any, which is erased to Object: so there you have it, to put an I onto an Ljava.lang.Object stack slot you need boxing.

```scala
/* val resultOfIfExpression: Any = */ 
  if (nonTrivialCondition == 42) {
    returnsPrimitive(5) // put resultOfIfExpression: Any = Integer(returnsPrimitive(5))
  } else {
    Unit                // put resultOfIfExpression: Any = Unit
  }
```

This could certainly be improved (-optimize doesn't help here) but it's not a blocker. With GenBCode just around the corner, it may be best if Miguel has a look.
Btw, replacing the Unit with 0 or removing the false branch altogether eliminates the boxing:
```scala
  if (nonTrivialCondition == 42) {
    returnsPrimitive(5)
  } else {
    0
  }
```
OR
```scala
  if (nonTrivialCondition == 42) {
    returnsPrimitive(5)
  }
```

yields:

```scala
  public void testme();
    Code:
       0: bipush        42
       2: bipush        42
       4: if_icmpne     15
       7: aload_0       
       8: iconst_5      
       9: invokevirtual #20                 // Method returnsPrimitive:(I)I
      12: goto          16
      15: iconst_0      
      16: pop           
      17: getstatic     #25                 // Field scala/Unit$.MODULE$:Lscala/Unit$;
      20: pop           
      21: return  
```
I should point out that it's unlikely that you meant to refer to `Unit` in the else branch, and probably meant:

```scala
  if (nonTrivialCondition == 42) {
    returnsPrimitive(5)
  } else {
    ()
  }
```

In such code, no boxing is incurred under `-optimize`, test case: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/6527
