On Scala 2.8 BETA 1:

Have a publisher and event set as follows

  abstract class ViewEvent()
  case class RefreshViewEvent( start: Boolean ) extends ViewEvent

  class View
    extends Whatever
       with Publisher[ViewEvent] 

Then have a Subscriber class defined as follows:

  class X( val view: View )
    extends Y 
       with Subscriber[ViewEvent,View]

when I try the following within X

  view.subscribe( this )
  
I get the following error reported in Eclipse

  type mismatch;
  found   : X
  required: scala.collection.mutable.Subscriber[ViewEvent,View#Pub]

the '#Pub' bit looks out of place...

This happens in several places, in all such places this worked fine in Scala 2.7.x.

As you can see from above I have modified the Publisher (View in the above sample) to match the new 2.8 signature.

I reported it against the Standard Library, not Eclipse. Whether this is a compiler issue or a library issue is not for me to say (personally I feel the library classes are wrong, even if this is a compiler issue).

A test case is trivial, the code below reports the error on `p.subscribe( this )`

```scala
package bugs

import scala.collection.mutable.Publisher
import scala.collection.mutable.Subscriber

object PubSub
{
  class Evt

  class MyPublisher extends Publisher[Evt]
  {
    
  }
  
  class MySubscriber( val p: MyPublisher ) extends Subscriber[Evt,MyPublisher]
  {
    p.subscribe( this )
  }

}
```
The code above also complains that Publisher takes 2 type arguments. When provided with `MyPublisher` as the second type argument, it complains `notify` method is not implemented in `MySubscriber`.

```scala

import scala.collection.mutable.Publisher
import scala.collection.mutable.Subscriber


object PubSub {
  class Event

  class MyPublisher extends Publisher[Event, MyPublisher] {
  }
  
  class MySubscriber( val p: MyPublisher ) extends Subscriber[Event,MyPublisher] {
    def notify(pub: MyPublisher, event: Event): Unit {}
  }

}

```
Disregard last message. Code below compiles with the r20820.

```scala

import scala.collection.mutable.Publisher
import scala.collection.mutable.Subscriber


object PubSub {
  class Event

  class MyPublisher extends Publisher[Event] {
    type Pub = MyPublisher
  }
  
  class MySubscriber( val p: MyPublisher ) extends Subscriber[Event,MyPublisher] {
    def notify(pub: MyPublisher, event: Event): Unit = {}
  }

}


```
