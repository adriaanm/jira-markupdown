Whew.  It was my mistake to misread the spec when I was learning the language (specese, as it's been called).  I thought this would make an interesting (at the time) contribution, but paulp's use case is obviated by other features (macros).  By coincidence, I was just touching this production in my last PR, wondering if {{Int`*`}} is a good param type, with star as a regular identifier instead of some intermediate category.
