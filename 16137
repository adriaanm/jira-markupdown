=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
  % touch help.scala
  % fsc help.scala
  % mkdir -p new && mv help.scala new
  % cd new
  % fsc help.scala  # this should build help.scala in directory "new" 
  error: source file 'help.scala' could not be found
  one error found
  % mv help.scala ..
  % fsc help.scala  # here help.scala relates to ../help.scala
{code} 



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

When running fsc from a different directory.. if there is already a scala compiler daemon running then it should inherit the new current working directory of fsc.

=== What do you see instead? ===

When running fsc, if there is no scala compiler daemon running it is run with the current working directory of fsc, but keeps this PWD for all subsequent runs until the daemon exits, even when subsequent fsc invocations are from different directories.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.9
  - Java: OpenJDK 1.6.0_22
  - Operating system:  Linux 2.6.37
