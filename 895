Have found. Say:

- srcRoot/po/Obj.scala with this (incorrect because of 'protected') code:

{code}
package po

protected object Obj { def f = {} }
{code}

- srcRoot/po/sub/ObjCall.scala with a code:

{code}
package po.sub

import po.Obj

class ObjCall { Obj.f }
{code}

All these give: "An internal error occurred during: "Building Workspace". no acc def buf for package po".

Helpful?
