Not sure if this is a bug in scaladoc, or an error in the comment in the source.

See the f method in http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.StringContext - the note is in between the two @throws', since it's grouped with the one scaladoc shows as the first (although in the code it's the second).
