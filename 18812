This is a regression (from 2.11.0-M7). When I compile specs2 I get some new compilation errors in such code:

{code:scala}
class UserGuide extends Specification { def is = s2"""
  this is some code which you can use ${snippet {
     import org.specs2._
     class MySpec extends Specification { def is = ok }
  }}
"""
}
{code}

{{snippet}} is a macro which captures some code and displays it in the s2 interpolated string (and optionally executes it). The issue is that the {{import org.specs2._}} is not seen anymore and then I have a compilation error on {{class MySpec extends Specification}}

Unfortunately I haven't been able to reduce the example yet.
