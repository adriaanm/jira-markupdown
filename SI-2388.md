[Edited/minimized.] The spurious $anon error does not occur if they are both defs.

```scala
class Foo {
  val searchField = new AnyRef { search() }
  def search() = searchField
}
```
I'm kicking this back to reviewer because I'm not able to figure what puts it in my zone.  BTW these days there is only one spurious error:
```scala
scalac28 MyDialog2.scala 
MyDialog2.scala:12: error: recursive method search needs result type
        search()
        ^
MyDialog2.scala:9: error: not found: type $$anon
  private val searchField = new JTextField() {
                            ^
two errors found
```
(extempore in [r25457](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25457)) Avoid some spurious errors after a cyclical reference error.
Closes #2388, no review.
