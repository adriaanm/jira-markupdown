I notice just now this is related to SI-5120. In both tickets there is an invariant type parameter, and an abstract type which is derived from the type parameter. A loss of fidelity in that derivation allows the "invariant" type to vary, and unsoundness results. In SI-5120 the lever is how existentials are simplified, and here the lever is variance checking. Since abstract types can be used in many more ways than type parameters (by virtue of being members, and because they can be referenced from subclasses and from the outside) and because they are considerably less fully exercised than type parameters, I think it likely we have more variations on this theme to discover.
