In Scala concrete members always override abstract members.
```scala
scala> class Derived { def clone: AnyRef }
<console>:7: error: overriding method clone in class Derived of type ()AnyRef;
 method clone in class Object of type ()Object has weaker access privileges; it should be public;
 (Note that method clone in class Derived of type ()AnyRef is abstract,
  and is therefore overridden by concrete method clone in class Object of type ()Object)
       class Derived { def clone: AnyRef }
             ^
```

Here's a quick attempt to use Java rules for Java defined methods:

I still need to exercise it with some more tests and run it past Martin.
