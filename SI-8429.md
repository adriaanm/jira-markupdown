Under -Xexperimental i get the following compilation error.

{code}
public interface Must {
  void musta(String str, int i);
}
{code}

{code}
object Mustare {
  def takesM(m: Must) = ???
  takesM{ (a, b) => println } // compiles 
  takesM{  
     case (a: String, b: Int) => println("")
  }
}
{code}
error: missing parameter type for expanded function

Expected type was: Must
