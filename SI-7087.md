There seems to be a hard-coding of Option somewhere. isSuccess doesn't seem to get picked for other monads?

In addition, if the signature of runOrElse is NOT
```scala
    def runOrElse[T, U](in: T)(matcher: T => Monad[U]): U =
```
then, there are typing problems. For the list monad, it's convenient for runOrElse to return List[U].

It seems like the partial function syntax ought to also be virtualized, so that we can return a custom type for other monads. For example, in the list monad, a partial function is best viewed as just A => List[B] (its eta-expansion).
