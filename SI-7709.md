This is fine

```scala
class VC(val s: String) extends AnyVal

class AImpl {
 def a : VC = new VC("a")
}

class X {

  def build(v: String) = new AImpl {
    private var _a = new VC(v)    
    override def a : VC = _a
    def a_=(newA: String) { _a = new VC(newA) }
  }
}
```

But this isn't

```scala

class VC(val s: String) extends AnyVal

class AImpl {
 def a : VC = new VC("a")
}

class X {
  def build(v: String) = new AImpl {
    override var a = new VC(v)
  }
}
```

It fails with

```scala
error: Parameter type in structural refinement may not refer to a user-defined value class
  def build(v: String) = new AImpl {
```

Instead of

```scala
 error: method a_= overrides nothing
```
Well actually the equivalent of the structural refinement with a var would be

```scala
 def build(v: String) = new AImpl {
    private var _a = new VC(v)    
    override def a : VC = _a
    def a_=(newA: VC) { _a = newA }
  }
```

Which fails with a better error message:

```scala
error: Parameter type in structural refinement may not refer to a user-defined value class
    def a_=(newA: VC) { _a = newA }
```

At least here we know where the error come from (the focus is on the method rather than the whole class).

I believe this is the desired behavior due to implementation restrictions. That's what `def checkMethodStructuralCompatible` says in `Typers`.

I change the title to confusing instead of incorrect.
