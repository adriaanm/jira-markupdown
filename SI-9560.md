* Scaladoc doesn't need to parse JSON, only generate it, and it's silly to depend on scala.util.parsing for that, especially since it only happens in one small place so the dependency would be easy to cut
* similarly for XML, except cutting the dependency is harder because we're generating HTML throughout the code. but but there's no truly fundamental difficulty

in both cases we could avoid replacing one Scala dependency with another Scala dependency by just using plain Scala and/or by adding a Java dependency.

main benefit is reduced complexity in the build.

see discussion at https://github.com/scala/slip/issues/24#issuecomment-157137761 and https://gitter.im/scala/slip?at=564a3a2e8b242470793e3035 (for HTML generation, Haoyi thought "vendoring a small 1000loc subset of scalatags" was plausible)

also I discussed this with retronym just now and:

* he doesn't recall there being any special reason that the parser-combinators dependency was left in place
* if they'd realized in advance how much work setting up the necessary "build gymnastics" for the circular dependencies would be, they might have considered other approaches, and just because those gymnastics now exist isn't a good reason to keep using them unless really needed
* he says there might be a place in a non-Scaladoc portion of the compiler where there's another not-really-needed dependency on scala-xml; if so, that could be taken care of at the same time

Looks like [~moors] already removed the use of scala-xml in parsing compiler plugin descriptors as part of https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2667
