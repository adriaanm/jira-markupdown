Hi,

A code like:

object Main {
  def main(args : Array[String]) : Unit = {
    
    println(classOf[Any])
  }
}


yields NoClassDefFoundError. This situation should be a compile time error and not a runtime error.

Br's,
Marius
This works in the trunk, and {{classOf}} always returns the erased type of its argument. So in your example it will print {{Object}}.
I think, think this is wrong.

{code}
classOf[Int]
{code}

returns Integer.TYPE, not classOf[Integer].

classOf[Any].isAssignableFrom(classOf[Any])

should be true, if classOf[Any] allowed.
Stepan, can you be more explicit, please? 

Here is what the output is when running the trunk compiler:
{code}
scala> classOf[Any].isAssignableFrom(classOf[Any])
res0: Boolean = true
{code}

This is according to the spec (section 6.2) """The value of such a class literal is the run-time representation of the class type C .""".

If you meant {{classOf[Any].isAssignableFrom(classOf[Int])}}, then indeed it won't return true. But that is to be expected, since Java reflection is not aware of the Scala type system. There are more examples that show this mismatch, and until we have a proper reflection library for Scala we can't deal with them any better. At any rate, {{isAssignableFrom}} is not part of the Scala specification, and we definitely can't support it.

Forbidding {{classOf}} on any type that is not a proper Java type would just make things worse, IMO.
