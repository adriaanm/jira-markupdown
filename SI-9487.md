When a type of an anonymous class is less specific that the definition of the class (AnyRef for example) the anonymous class methods become private. This happens with val, def and var definition inside the class.

```scala
  type T = {val x: String; def y: String; var z: String}

  // This one generates to compile the anonymous class properly.
  // It marks all methods and field accessors as private
  // If the return type is T then it compiles correctly
  def get(): AnyRef = new { val x = "x"; def y = "y"; var z = "z"}

  val obj = get()
  // Prints: Failure(java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: A$$anon$2.x())
  println(Try(obj.asInstanceOf[T].x))

  // Prints: Failure(java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: A$$anon$2.y())
  println(Try(obj.asInstanceOf[T].y))

  // Prints: Failure(java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: A$$anon$2.z())
  println(Try(obj.asInstanceOf[T].z))
  // Failure(java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: A$$anon$1.z_$eq(java.lang.String))
  println(Try(obj.asInstanceOf[T].z = "zz"))
  // Prints: Failure(java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: A$$anon$2.z())
  println(Try(obj.asInstanceOf[T].z))

  println
  println("Fields:")
  // Lists x and z fields as expected
  obj.getClass.getDeclaredFields.foreach(x => println(s"  $x"))
  println("Methods:")
  // All methods are private but should be public
  obj.getClass.getDeclaredMethods.foreach(x => println(s"  $x"))
```

It looks like a code pattern that should be avoided, but in Scala.js this is used to create javascript objects. https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/1899
Hum, that looks related indeed, and the comment suggests this is Hard (tm). However, IIUC, the linked backstory explains why the *type* of the Block needs to hide away some members. But I don't think that explains why the actual *class* itself (its implementation) needs to suddenly turn public members into private ones. It seems to me that there might be a relatively easy fix to that (compared to fixing the *type* issue).

It is also worth mentioning that if the anonymous class does not have any expected type at all, then the members are kept public. For example rewriting `get()` above as:

```scala
def get(): AnyRef = {
  val o = new { ... }
  o
}
```

allows all members to be public.
