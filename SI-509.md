scalac (and fsc) look into the destination directory (given with {{-d}}) for classes, unlike {{javac}}. This can lead to very surprising results, and since it is not documented, I consider this as a bug. If it is the intended behaviour, please document it or even rename the {{-d}} option to something else, as most if not all Java programmers do not expect such behaviour.

Here is an example to illustrate the problem:
{code}
[paine y]% ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 michelschinz  wheel  91 18 f�v 20:23 First.scala
-rw-r--r--  1 michelschinz  wheel  91 18 f�v 20:23 Second.scala
[paine y]% cat First.scala 
object First {
  def name = "First"
  def printSecond =
    Console.println(Second.name)
}
[paine y]% cat Second.scala 
object Second {
  def name = "Second"
  def printFirst =
    Console.println(First.name)
}
[paine y]% mkdir classes classes2
[paine y]% scalac -d classes First.scala Second.scala 
[paine y]% rm Second.scala 
[paine y]% scalac -d classes First.scala -verbose |& grep Second
[loaded class file classes/Second.class in 0ms]
[paine y]% scalac -d classes2 First.scala                        
First.scala:4: error: not found: value Second
    Console.println(Second.name)
                    ^
one error found
{code}


I think Sean wrote the code that adds outdir to classpath. Sean, can you explain why one shoudl do this? Would it be possible to remove it? I agree with Michel that it can be very confusing.
