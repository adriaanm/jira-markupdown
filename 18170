val a = Vector(1,2,4).search(0)
val b = Vector(1,2,4).search(3)
val c = Vector(1,2,4).search(5)

a = InsertionPoint(-1)
b = InsertionPoint(1)
c = InsertionPoint(2)

whereas it should be:
a = InsertionPoint(0)
b = InsertionPoint(2)
c = InsertionPoint(3)


Proposed fix in Searching line 89 ( private def binarySearch )

is:
if (to - from == 1 ) InsertionPoint(from)

should be:
if (to - from == 1 ) InsertionPoint(from+1)
