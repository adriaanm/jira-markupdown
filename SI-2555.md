Submitting an array containing 4585 items all of which compare equal in the sorting order to scala.util.Sorting.quickSort() produces a StackOverflowError (using default JVM stack allocation). Substituting util.Sorting.stableSort does not.

Scala version: 2.7.4.final
JVM: Sun JDK 1.6.0_15
Arch: x86 (32 bits)
OS: Linux; kernel 2.6.27
The following optimization should help with arrays of many repeated elements, and should hardly have any impact otherwise:

```scala
       var a = off 
       var d = off + len - 1 
       while (a <= d && x(a) == v) a += 1
       while (d <= a && x(a) == v) d -= 1
       var b = a 
       var c = d 
       var done = b <= c
```


Damn. Silly cut&paste bugs. Correcting:

```scala
       var a = off 
       var d = off + len - 1 
       while (a <= d && x(a) == v) a += 1
       while (d >= a && x(d) == v) d -= 1
       var b = a 
       var c = d 
       var done = b <= c
```
Ok, I attached a patch that solves the problem (by eliminating recursion) and a scalacheck test to ensure nothing was broken.

There is also a slight optimization, where `swap(a,b)` and `swap(c, d)` when `a == b` or `c == d`, respectively, are skipped.
i can't reproduce that with scala 2.8.0.final - please re-open if i'm mistaken.
