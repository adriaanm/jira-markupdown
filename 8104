After inlining `defaultIfIOException` the TFA is caught in a trap because:
- on exit from block 1 there's just the Console object on the stack,
- block 5 (the start of an EH, reached by exceptional control-flow from 6) has `stack height == 1` on exit (the stack contains just the String pushed in that block). There's a normal control-flow edge from 5 to 4.
- the other predecessor of block 4 (block 6) has an out-flow where the stack contains (a) the Console object it had on entry plus (b) a string

As a result we have inconsistent stack height on entry to 6.
