@Jasper Thanks for that explanation, that makes sense.

Just to clear my mind, when we say "structural type", we're talking about some structure of a type and not explicitly about the Scala feature called structural types, right? We just need a way to describe a *shape* of a type we don't know yet.

Regarding your example in the code, what is that trying to convey? Not sure I follow. I would imagine the first one doesn't work is it doesn't match the structure of `Object.clone`.
