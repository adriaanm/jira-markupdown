OK, maybe this should be a separate ticket?  I am not really sure if it's the same issue or not, but it still fails with 2.8.0-20091106.025327.  Here's an example - the jgrapht references are what I am using in my application, but "MyGraph" is sufficient to show the problem:

{code}

package bug

//import org.jgrapht.graph.SimpleGraph
//import org.jgrapht.graph.DefaultWeightedEdge

object Main extends Application {

  class MyGraph[V <: Any] {
    def addVertex(v: V): Boolean = true
  }

  type DuckGraph = {
    def addVertex(vertex: Int): Boolean
  }

  def crash(graph: DuckGraph) {
    println("trying...")
    graph.addVertex(1)
    println("success")
  }

  crash(new MyGraph[Int])
//  crash(new SimpleGraph[Int, DefaultWeightedEdge](classOf[DefaultWeightedEdge]))
}
{code}

Cheers + thanks for what is (otehrwise) a pretty nice *practical* language that I hope one day to use at work...
