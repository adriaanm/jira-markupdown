Exiting the REPL interpreter renders the terminal unusable.  Observe:

jim@DELL:~$ scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.0.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_24).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> :quit
jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ jim@DELL:~$ 

No matter how I exit the interpreter, I can no longer use the terminal.  If I try to type something in the terminal after I exit, nothing appears on the screen.  Hitting enter results in a new prompt, but on the same line as the previous one.  It is as if the newline character no longer operates.  However, I can start the scala REPL again and everything will be fine.
