Similar issue to #3265
filter is overridden in Stream whereas filterNot is implemented in TransversableLike.  This implementation is not working for Stream in 2.11.0 and 2.11.1.  It was working in previous versions (2.10.0 and 2.9.2 tested)

```scala
 scala> Stream.from(1).filter(_ > 5)
res2: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Int] = Stream(6, ?)

scala> Stream.from(1).filterNot(_ <= 5)
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

```
Looks like this has been broken and fixed before:
#6440
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/7a6905dc158a7a543ba3f4ddeeffe538580958d3
There's even a test: test/files/run/t6440.scala

Here is the commit that broke this again:
https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/3059e3a0c039645158d2e5533e84d00f508ca824#diff-4b8694484188574dce55135fd0bc9ae5
I have just issued a pull request for this:
https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3925
@lrytz Did you want to fix this one, or shall I grab it?
@Ichoran I'm Happy to hand it off :-)
@lrytz I guess I should go for the ugly hack that fixes it in 2.11.5 rather than waiting for 2.12?  Or shall we just say this one's buggered 'til then?
@adriaanm I need to do more extensive testing to see if we will clobber performance too greatly in 2.11 if we fix this the way that will work with binary compatibility (i.e. intercept it in the superclass).  Since this is a potentially dangerous change, I want to make sure to test in a variety of scenarios (e.g. with and without multiple dispatch).  I will retarget if the results of testing are disappointing.
@adriaanm Not fixable in 2.11 without significant performance penalty (up to about 40% slowdown in List.filterNot on single-element lists).  Deferring to 2.12.  How can we document this so that the lack of laziness of filterNot is discoverable in 2.11?
@cvogt The fix version is 2.12.0-M1. 2.11.everything is going to be affected because, as explained above, it *cannot* be fixed unless we either break binary compatibility or introduce major performance penalties on other collections.

And yes, of course, the offending line in the bug report will go in a test.
AFAICT the referenced pull request does not fix this issue; instead it fixes #8552
i think the commit that fixed this ticked in 2.12.x is https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3949 (which was merged forward into 2.12.x). The commit was later reverted in 2.11.x due to binary incompatibility (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4048), but the revert was annotated `[nomerge]`, which means it was merged into 2.12.x with `-s ours`.
