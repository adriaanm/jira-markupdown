This seems like a simple oversight where the methods were defined without a `[B >: A]` type parameter.

These don't work:

```
scala> None #:: Stream(Some(1))
<console>:12: error: type mismatch;
 found   : None.type
 required: Some[Int]
       None #:: Stream(Some(1))
            ^

scala> Stream(None) #::: Stream(Some(1))
<console>:12: error: type mismatch;
 found   : scala.collection.immutable.Stream[None.type]
 required: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Some[Int]]
       Stream(None) #::: Stream(Some(1))
                    ^
```

but surely they should given that List :: and ::: allow it:

```
scala> None :: List(Some(1))
res2: List[Option[Int]] = List(None, Some(1))

scala> List(None) ::: List(Some(1))
res4: List[Option[Int]] = List(None, Some(1))
```

And given that other Stream operations allow widening:

```
scala> Stream.cons(None, Stream(Some(1)))
res10: Stream.Cons[Option[Int]] = Stream(None, ?)

scala> Stream(None).append(Stream(Some(1)))
res12: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Option[Int]] = Stream(None, ?)

scala> Stream(None) ++ Stream(Some(1))
res13: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[Option[Int]] = Stream(None, ?)
```
