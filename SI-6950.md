scala> val Array(a,b, c @ _*) = Array(1,2,3,4)
a: Int = 1
b: Int = 2
c: Seq[Int] = Vector(3, 4)
{code}

c contains a Vector instead of an Array.
The extractor pattern implemented in {{Array.unapplySeq}} has no relationship to the type {{Array}}, other than the shared name. Sequence wildcard patterns are always typed as {{Seq[A]}}.
