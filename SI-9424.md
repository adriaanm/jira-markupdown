Well, the problem is best described by code. Look at the order of the elements after I add the first "3". It seems to be wrong.


```java
scala> import scala.collection._
import scala.collection._

scala> val a = mutable.PriorityQueue.empty[Int](Ordering.by(-_))
a: scala.collection.mutable.PriorityQueue[Int] = PriorityQueue()

scala> a += 2
res0: a.type = PriorityQueue(2)

scala> a += 10
res1: a.type = PriorityQueue(2, 10)

scala> a += 3
res2: a.type = PriorityQueue(2, 10, 3)

scala> a += 3
res3: a.type = PriorityQueue(2, 3, 3, 10)
```
I just noticed that this is only an issue with the string representation and that the underlying queue/deqeue codes works fine. Anyway, this should be fixed. However, I reduced the priority to "minor".


```java
a.dequeue
res34: Int = 2
a.dequeue
res35: Int = 3
a.dequeue
res36: Int = 10
```
