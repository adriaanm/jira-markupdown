I will have to close this ticket as "invalid". The Java 7 Early Access code is not production quality, and these problems may very well be transient. In order to check the situation, I installed a fresh copy same version of Java 7 on a 64-bit Windows 7, and the first run of "scalac" quite simply caused an internal failure in the JVM (see below). We cannot even start any debugging under these circumstances: the Java 7 code is just not stable enough at this time.
```scala
C:\Users\cunei>scalac
"java" -Xmx256M -Xms32M -Dscala.home="C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\.." -Denv.emacs="" -cp "C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\..\lib\jline.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\..\lib\scala-compiler.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\..\lib\scala-dbc.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\..\lib\scala-library.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\..\lib\scala-swing.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\scala\bin\..\lib\scalap.jar" scala.tools.nsc.Main
