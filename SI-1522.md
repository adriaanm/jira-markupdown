I created a new Scala project. Within my src folder, I created a new package, com.sas.djb
and added a class T.scala:
{code}
package com.sas.djb

import scala.util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers
import scala.collection.mutable.Map

class T extends RegexParsers {
   def FOR = regex("for".r)
}

{code}

The imports ("util" and "collection") are flagged with warnings such as

value util is not a member of package com.sas.djb.scala

See the attached screenshot.

The warnings do not show up in the Problems view

If I close then reopen T.scala, there are no warnings.
If I modify the buffer, the warning flags reappear
(with pink gutter markers) but they still do not 
apepar in the Problems view.

Also note the refresh problem in the attached screenshot;
the def FOR = ... line appears twice but it only exists once
in the source; the editor did not refresh it correctly.
(I had positioned the cursor on the blank line before
the class keyword and pressed Backspace to delete the
blank line).

I created another package in my src firectory, djb, 
and created another T.scala there:

{code}
package djb

import scala.util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers
import scala.collection.mutable.Map

class T extends RegexParsers {
   def FOR = regex("for".r)
}
{code}

and there are no warnings.

This is a new install of Eclipse 3.4 J2EE Ganymede and scala-eclipse 2.7.2 on Windows XP, JDK is 1.6.0_05

Duplicate of SI-1277 (which shouldn't have been closed).
The "is not a member of package " bug appears on packages rooted in more than one place.

e.g.

X.jar has package x.y.z.bob
Y.jar has package x.y.z.carol

I get the an error message if I do an import
import x.y.z.carol._

if I fix this to be 
import x.y.z.carol.{Ted,Alice}

then the error symbol disappears but the pink line and error warning message remain


This is a duplicate of SI-1277. If you have additional scenarios which illustrate SI-1277 please add them there and don't reopen this bug.
