In [JavaDoc for Object.equals|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html] 
{panel:title=}
It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value {{x}}, {{x.equals\(x\)}} should return {{true}}.
{panel}

However, SeqView does not conform the rule:

{code}
Welcome to Scala 2.12.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_102).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> val v = Seq(0.0, 1.0).view.map{ d => d + math.random }
v: scala.collection.SeqView[Double,Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)

scala> v == v
res0: Boolean = false
{code}
I think the only way to make {{SeqView}} conform these rules is making {{SeqView}} not be a {{GenSeq}} or {{Seq}} any more, though {{SeqView}} can extends {{GenSeqLike}} and {{SeqLike}}.
