The same thing with ScalaPattern in xml injections.
You can use: 
{code}
  <xml>{pattern@_*}</xml>
{code}
But in spec written that ScalaPatterns ::= ‘{’ Patterns ‘}’
Patterns is Pattern sequence. And situatation that pattern@_* could be not described.
Only StableId(pattern@_*) allowed by specification.
It's very important to know precise parser behaviour.
