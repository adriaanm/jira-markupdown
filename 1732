Ok I looked into this, I think I see where the problem is

it is related to scala/bug#1717

the fix that was used there could be applied here as well, however the fix used there was to turn off autoclosing strings for example when a " is typed a second "" is automatically inserted. To fix scala/bug#1717 an aspect was created that turns off that behaviour. A similar fix could be implemented here that does the same thing for brackets. This is not a good solution, as ( & [ completion for the people that like might be annoying to lose. However I think it would work as a temporary patch. To implement this I will make a patch of the aspect file adding the relevant behaviour to turn off setCloseAngularBracketsEnabled & setCloseBracketsEnabled the same as was done for strings. It should be attached in a few minutes

The real issue is that the code in eclipse in:
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor.BracketInserter consumes the event on Line 547 (doit = false). After the event gets consumed the normal chain of events that lead to scala.tools.eclipse.Editor.customizeDocumentCommand getting called never happens. Somehow perhaps a pointcut can be made that forces the editor to get those edits in that case, that would be better the solution
