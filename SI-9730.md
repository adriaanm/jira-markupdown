{code:scala}
import scala.annotation.tailrec

object TestLazyTail {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = (() => f(true))()

  @tailrec
  private def f(next: Boolean): Unit = {
    // Should always output 5!
    lazy val x = 5
    println(x)

    if (next) f(false) else ()
  }
}
{code}

Output is:

5
0

Expected:

5
5

The necessary conditions I've found for this to show the issue:

1. The call to the function must be in a closure
2. The function must be tail optimized
3. The function must be private
4. The variable must be a lazy val

Other aspects of this snippet don't seem to impact the result.
