Open the following file in scala-mode in emacs:

{code}
////// abc 
asd
das
das
das
asd
{code}

Each extra pair of `//` adds one more line below the comment that is highlighted as a comment. In the above example, the first two lines below the comment are highlighted as comments.
This is a limitation of Emacs where the syntax choosen for Scala can not be handled by Emacs.
Let me try to explain the problem. 
In Scala there are two kinds of comments, the single line // and the multiline /* */ comments. However these comment are allowed to be nested so /* /*  */ */ is perfectly ok. If this was the only comment then it would not be a problem, however because // uses the same characters to indicate single line comment emacs goes bad :-/ If the single line comment should be ## or something that does not include a /, then emacs would be able to handle it. 

So basically, this is a limitation in emacs itself and it cant be fixed as it is (or to my knowledge). Sorry
