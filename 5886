OK, it seems that quite some parts have outdated assumptions, like this part:

{code}
// source 'class A { ... }' becomes in bytecode: interface A.class + class A$$class.class
// source 'object A { ... }' becomes in bytecode: interface A.class + class A$$.class
val append = if (loader.loadClass(className).isInterface) "$$class" else "$$"
{code}

When did Scala actually change the classname mangling? It is certainly before I started looking at Scala during 2.7.x. 

This code obviously hasn't worked since a long time, isn't used anywhere and mainly just throws exceptions.

Maybe this is a candidate for a "quick delete"?
Even Java did that once with some constructor which used a private class and therefore wasn't usable for any user code at all.
