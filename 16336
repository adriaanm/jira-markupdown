Consider this REPL session: 
```scala
scala> Tuple1(1)
res0: (Int,) = (1,)
```

the `,` seems to be superfluous.

I can confirm that this behaviour exists in 2.10 trunk, 2.9.0.1.

2.8.1 has a slightly different output:
```scala
scala> Tuple(1)
warning: there were deprecation warnings; re-run with -deprecation for details
res0: (Int,) = (1)
```

The larger question remains, if Tuple1 has an actual use-case to justify its existence...
