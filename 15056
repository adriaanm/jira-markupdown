On Windows, where line.separator is \r\n, the scala compiler 2.8.0.Beta1 converts the platform newlines in multiline strings to \n.

This is wrong.

Steps to reproduce:
Create nl.scala with:
```scala
println("""
""".getBytes.length)
```
Make sure it has Windows line separator \r\n.

scala-2.8.0.Beta1-prerelease:
```scala
scala nl.scala
1
```

Expected results (scala 2.7.7):
```scala
scala nl.scala
2
```

I was also able to reproduce this also with scala-2.8.0-20100214.025735-327 (latest from maven snaphots repo).

Specs way to reproduce:
```scala
"""
""" must_== "\r\n"
```
Note you can force the windows line separators in file from SVN by setting the *svn:eol-style* property to *CRLF*.
