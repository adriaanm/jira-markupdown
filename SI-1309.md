This code fails with a !ClassCastException. It looks like there's some difficulty converting the unboxed Array[Byte] back into a !RandomAccessSeq[Byte].

```scala
def f(ras: => RandomAccessSeq[Byte]): RandomAccessSeq[Byte] = ras
f(new Array[Byte](0))
```

```scala
java.lang.ClassCastException: [B cannot be cast to scala.RandomAccessSeq
        at Main$$$$anon$$1.f((virtual file):5)
```

The problem goes away if the code is changed to use call-by-value, or if it we change !RandomAccessSeq[Byte] to Seq[Byte].

I see the problem with both 2.7.1 final and the latest nightly (2.7.2.r15968-b20080831010101).
