The attached code does not compile and issues an error message

problem.scala:21: overloaded method value output with alternatives:
[error]   (value: Boolean,pp: () => Unit*)Unit <and>
[error]   (value: Int,pp: () => Unit*)Unit
[error]  cannot be applied to (Int, Unit)
[error]  output(42, pr1)
[error]  ^
[error] one error found

The problem can be fixed by explicitly providing a type for pr1, i.e., output(42, pr1: Printer)


I *really dislike* having to use trac as a support channel and re-close tickets.  You guys want stuff fixed, you better leave me some time to do something other than this.  As jason states, eta expansion cannot take place unless the expected type is a function, which is not the case in the presence of overloading.  This is as specified.

// this is the part where you are turning trac into a support line
output(42, pr1 _)
