i don't want to be the bad guy, but this is a symptomatic fix

the deeper problem, at least for SI-2741, and most like here as well, is related to a lacking implementation of anonymous type functions
I now how to fix it, but it's a big change.

asSeenFrom shouldn't even be trying to instantiate A in Compose, as it defines no such type parameter
