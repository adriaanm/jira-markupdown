When clicking on {{shouldRethrow}} in the constructor param list for {{Catch}} the constructor parameter documentation is momentarily revealed but then as expected the page is navigated away. The parameter documentation should only expand when the click leaves the user on the page. Expanding the documentation and then leaving the page appeared to me initially as a functional defect rather than the cosmetic one it is. The UI would be better off without this confusing visual cueing.
