Well, third-party libraries don't necessarily try very hard to make their by-name-accepting functions inline friendly (definitely without an `@inline` hint in many cases).

I'm more interested in eliding a pointless anonymous class regardless of inline behavior, so that (for instance) an app intentionally compiled without `-optimise`, with a bunch of debug-level logging, wouldn't greatly inflate to the point of having more classes containing static debug messages than actual code.
