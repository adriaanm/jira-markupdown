Example of the bug in action:

```scala
scala> val sb = new StringBuilder();
sb: StringBuilder =

scala> new xml.dtd.PublicID(
     |      "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN",
     |      "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd").toString(sb);
res4: StringBuilder = PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" SYSTEM "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"
```

The last line SHOULD not contain the SYSTEM keyword, as follows: 

```scala

res4: StringBuilder = PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"

```

Please consult the syntax for a Document Type Declaration, as can be found at:[[BR]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration#Syntax][[BR]]
(The official documentation is harder to find, but Wikipedia seems to be correct here).

The behaviour should also be correct for toString() (besides toString(:StringBuilder), but the toString() implementation misses altogether (See ticket #1488).
Like #1488, fixed since 2.7.3.
