Paul's patch also avoids a crash on this code, reported by Mirco in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/Cp-YuueuqAs/JvSU9LncdjwJ

{code}
object Foo {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = execute {
    class VInt(val v: Int) extends AnyVal
  }

  def execute(body: => Unit): Unit = body
} 
{code}

Is this something we want to support in 2.10.0?
