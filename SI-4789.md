Commit r25230 reveals some problem in scalac that results in broken class signature emitted for GenTraversableFactory. As for now, scala library from trunk is completely unusable for Eclipse users.

In order to see the problem it's enough to create a following file in Eclipse:
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable.List;
import scala.collection.immutable.List$;

public class Test {
  void foo() {
    Object x = List$.MODULE$;
  }
}
```

Eclipse will complain about the first import with following error message:
Multiple markers at this line
	- The class file GenTraversableFactory<CC> contains a signature '()Lscala/collection/generic/GenTraversableFactory<TCC;>.ReusableCBF;' ill-formed at 
	 position 56
	- The class file GenTraversableFactory<CC> contains a signature '()Lscala/collection/generic/GenTraversableFactory<TCC;>.ReusableCBF;' ill-formed at 
	 position 56


A bit more involved example exposes this issue with javac:
```scala
mac-grek:src grek$ cat scala/collection/Test.java
package scala.collection;

import scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory;
import scala.collection.immutable.List;

public class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    GenTraversableFactory<List<Object>> x = null;
    x.ReusableCBF();
  }

}

mac-grek:src grek$ javac -classpath ~/tmp/badsigs/scala-library-2.10.0-20110711.015803-87.jar scala/collection/Test.java
scala/collection/Test.java:10: cannot access scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF
class file for scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF not found
    x.ReusableCBF();
                 ^
1 error
```

so javac doesn't crash but fails to find a method that is defined in class file:
```scala
mac-grek:generic grek$ javap GenTraversableFactory | grep Reusable
    public volatile scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF$ ReusableCBF$module;
    public final scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF$ ReusableCBF();
```

Iulian proposed following work-around:
```scala
mac-grek:scalagwt-scala grek$ git diff
diff --git a/src/library/scala/collection/generic/GenTraversableFactory.scala b/src/library/scala/collection/generic/GenTraversableFactory.scala

+  lazy val ReusableCBF = new reusableCBF

I can confirm that it works.
The error message isn't very helpful: in case anyone is misled, the signature is syntactically valid.  Position 56 is the . after the type parameters.  Here is some java code which creates a similar signature.

```scala
public class J<CC> {
  public class Inner { }
}

class K<CC> {
  // (LJ<TCC;>.Inner;)V;
  public void f(J<CC>.Inner param) { }
}
```

The example with javac fails because

  GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF$ // this exists
  GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF  // this doesn't.

And indeed the accessor is pointing at the one which doesn't exist:

  private volatile scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF$ ReusableCBF$module;
  public final scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF ReusableCBF();

Changing it to a lazy val fixes it not because the signature changes but because GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF is generated.
The same issue with immutable.RedBlack. Just create following file in Eclipse:
```scala
import scala.collection.immutable.RedBlack;

public class Test {}
```

and you'll get following error message:
Multiple markers at this line
	- The class file RedBlack<A> contains a signature '()Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Empty;' ill-formed at 
	 position 44
	- The class file RedBlack<A> contains a signature '()Lscala/collection/immutable/RedBlack<TA;>.Empty;' ill-formed at 
	 position 44

I believe there is other kind of broken signature (probably unrelated to this ticket) but it's hard to check it until this issue is fixed.
I think this is fixed, possibly not for all cases, in r25326.  I don't have time right now to do a lot more investigating, so if anyone wants to give me an update on what's still broken it would help.
I find that "badsigs" still reports the same number of errors, seems no happier, but now I have less idea what the problem is.  I'm pretty sure that fix is right regardless of whether we have yet made ecj happy.

(grek in [r25639](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25639)) Fix various InnerClasses bugs.

This commit fixes two major problems:

  1. InnerClasses table missed entries
     that would close the chain between
     nested and top-level class.
     
  2. In some situations, classes
     corresponding to objects would be
     not be reported in the InnerClasses
     table.

For details it's the best to check #4819, #4820 and
#4983.

First problem mentioned above was straightforward to
fix so I won't be going into details.

The second one deserves more attention. From now, classes
corresponding to objects are properly reported as inner
classes. Also, members (classes, objects) of objects are
reported as inner classes of classes corresponding to
objects.

There's one caveat though: top level objects get two
classes (regular and mirror). Members of top-level
objects are declared as inner classes of **mirror** class
and not regular one. The reason for that is to allow
importing them from Java. For example:

object A { class B }

will be compiled into following classes: A, A$, A$B.
If we declared A$B as inner class of A$ (regular class
for objects) then it would be impossible to import
B using "import A.B" or "import A$.B" constructs. The
reason for that is that Java compiler seems to blindly
put dollars instead of looking at InnerClasses attribute.

Since non-top-level objects don't have a mirror class
it's impossible to use the same solution. Thus, in case
like this:

object A { object B { class C } }

it's impossible to import C from Java. That's the tradeoff
for fixing other (more serious) problems. It's never been
possible to do that in a clean way so we are not making
situation worse.

As a nice consequence of this change, we get better way to
refer to inner members of top-level objects. It's been
reflected in one of test-cases that is updated by this
change.

Fixes #4789 #4819	#4820 #4983 and possibly some
other tickets related to reflection.

Review by extempore, dragos.
