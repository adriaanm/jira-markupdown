I've just noticed SI-2441 is a duplicate of this, so I'm closing that and keeping this one - but that one is worth checking out as well.  The situation there looks to be specific to companions, and is along the lines of:
{code}
class T
trait A { def f: T }
object Bob {
  private class X extends T
}
class Bob extends A {
  def f = new Bob.X
}  
{code}
That should either fail to compile, or the type inferred for f in Bob should be T.  Instead it is Bob.X.
(In r23935) Closes SI-4114. No review.
(In r23958) A test case for recently fixed SI-4114.  Plus!

I had closed SI-2441 as a duplicate of that, but unfortunately SI-4114 did
not bring SI-2441 along with it.  Then I realized I'm a programmer, not a
helpless trac watcher.  As is often the case with thes things, fixing that
revealed a bug in the library.  Closes SI-2441 for real, review by odersky.
