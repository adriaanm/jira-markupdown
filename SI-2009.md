The Actor.send method invokes the "waitingFor" function within a synchronized block.  If the receive/react partial function attempts to lock resources during ifDefinedAt testing, there could be a deadlock.  The send method should only touch local resources (not external code) during the synchronized block.

More generally, a message send should be super-quick and never have the ability to fail.  No matter the state of the Actor or the rest of the system (with the exception of low memory situations), a message send should work without accessing any external resources.  All external resources associated with message handling should be done only on the Actor thread and outside of any JVM-level resource locks.
You're really identifying two issues.  (1) the potential deadlock and (2) that a message send can result in an exception.  I've created ticket #2010 for the second issue.

Regarding the deadlock issue, that's not the only certain code in isDefinedAt can cause problems.  There's also #1518.

Anyway, I think isDefinedAt is assumed to be very inexpensive and to not look too much at state.  Most of the time I think that assumption holds.  Following that assumption, checking isDefinedAt is less expensive for the sender's thread than creating a new reaction to do the check (in the case of event-based actors).  Without benchmarking I'll say it's probably a wash (from the sender's perspective) compared to waking up an actor waiting in a receive block and having it check the condition.  In both cases I think the total cost of a message send goes up.

Consequently I'm not sure if the answer is to move evaluation of isDefinedAt into an actor thread, or if it is to update the documentation to say "don't put any expensive or potentially blocking operations in isDefinedAt because it will lead to undefined behavior and possibly deadlock." 
class MyActor extends Actor {
  private val mutableHashMap = new MutableHashMap[String, String]
  private var lst: List[String] = Nil

  def act = loop {
    react {
      case s: String if !mutableHashMap.contains(s) => mutableHashMap(s) = "Good morning"
      case s: String => lst ::= s
    }
  }
}

Because the guard is executed outside the scope of the actor and may be executed concurrently with a thread updating the mutablehashmap, you've given up all concurrency guarantees for Actors.  This is a serious defect.  It cannot reasonably be cured with a comment.  It can be cured by moving all code that touches (creates, tests, or applies) the partial function in react/receive to execute only on the thread that is currently running the Actor.  Anything short of that gives up what the Actor is.

That shouldn't be the case, and if it is, yes, that's a serious bug that can't be cured by a comment.

I think the way the current implementation is supposed to work the actor essentially takes over the sender's thread while it is checking the message.  If the actor is currently running on another thread, then it should just queue the message without examining it, thus isDefinedAt is never executed.  If it's waiting, then the synchronizing should serialize message sends so that it inspects the messages one at a time.

Actors are supposed to guarantee that they only execute on one thread at a time.  But they don't make any guarantees about what thread that is or how often it changes.  This should be possible with the current design, but it's quite possible that somewhere the synchronization isn't right and the guarantee is not being met.
