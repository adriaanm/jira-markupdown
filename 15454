Currently Scala does not infer the type of method and constructor parameters when a default is specified.

I propose to allow this.

It does introduce the problem that the type inferred may be undesirably specific; however, vals have this problem too and in some cases (like integers), it is not a problem.

Example:
{code}
class Foo(var x = 2)
def foo(x = 6)
{code}
