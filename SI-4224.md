= problem =

It seems that ScalaDoc2 doesn't support linking to methods (except by directly entering HTML like <a href="...">).

= enhancement recommendation =

For example, \[\[com.example.Class#method(Int, Int)\]\] should work similarly as {@link com.example.Class#method(Int, Int)} does with JavaDoc.
Now they are supported. See #3695 for a quick tutorial on using links to members.
