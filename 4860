(In r23174) Work on the pattern matcher.  Inspired by mark harrah submitting
patches for SI-3887 and SI-3888, but I determined that I could achieve
the same effect by deleting a bunch of code, so I did.  This left
only a few lines in TransMatch, so I eliminated it, which led me to
remember that many places still reference non-existent phase transmatch,
so those were updated.  Notes:

 * This swaps equality tests on stable identifier patterns.  They
 have never conformed to the spec (as noted long ago in ticket SI-785)
 which says "The pattern matches any value v such that r == v" whereas
 until now the test being performed was v == r.

 * An issue was introduced with specialization in that the implementation
 of "isTupleType" in Definitions relied upon sym == TupleClass(elems.length).
 This test is untrue for specialized tuples, causing mysterious behavior
 because only some tuples are specialized.  There is now "isTupleTypeOrSubtype"
 although it seems likely the former implementation is unnecessary.
 The issue is sidestepped if one uses "getProductArgs" to retrieve the element
 types because it sifts through the base types for the Product symbol.

Closes SI-3887 and SI-3888, review by dmharrah.
