Scala plugin version: 2.8.0 r16764 (nightly)
Eclipse version: 3.4.0 M20080911-1700 

After I rename file in package explorer (say main/Main.scala to main/Moon.scala) it shows two identically named files with new name one marked with "Scala" icon and other marked with "Java" icon. Refreshing project does not help to remove phantom tree node (one that is marked with Java icon). However file system only one file (as expected). After reopening project project explorer tree shows only one file with correct Scala icon.

Expected result:
After renaming file, file with new name is shown in the tree and tree shows no additional files.
Actually this is a duplicate of SI-1483.
