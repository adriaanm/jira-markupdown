I retract my comment above, I debugged the wrong thing.
@Jason: deEta, the code you mention, seems to change the type of the result. A comment should explain when it's supposed to work. If it never does, it should be removed, but assuming that it works correctly in some cases, a very minimal attempt for the fix can be found here:
https://github.com/Blaisorblade/scala/tree/issue/6306

It does work on the testcase, but it seems overkill; I add a set named `inByNameCallSite` analogously to `byNameArg`, but I'm not sure if I could just use byNameArg because I can't fully read the code; I currently suspect that I couldn't.

*If* this becomes a pull request, I'll add proper acknowledgments to everybody involved.
