public class M {

class X(name: String) extends M {
     val config: String = try {name} catch { case _ => ""}
}
new X("").name
{code}

java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access field X.name from class 

Note that the class X constructor parameter name matches java class M field name; the name is referenced in the constructor code of class X. Try block referencing "name" is needed to reproduce. This has been narrowed down from real code. If class M is implemented in Scala, no problem occurs. I am using 2.9.1 final, problem occurs both in Eclipse and REPL


Same as SI-4762: unwanted synthetic private[this] field shadows inherited public field.  This shows another dimension of it: shadowing a public field with a private[this] field means that the selection is allowed, only to fail at runtime.
