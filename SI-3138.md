	// If we cast d explicitly to C, we can even access the magically overridden method.

Please neglect the slipped-in sentence:
```scala
//     Expected in relation to (1) but not to (3). 
```
You don't have to cast it.  All you have to do is
```scala
(d: C).b()
```
Hard to see what can be done about it, unless we follow through on treating java and scala members differently.  Java no-argument methods all have parens so fields have to be able to override () methods.  Personally I'm not convinced it represents a loss of type safety either -- something not compiling does not represent unsoundness.  I'll leave it for martin & co to determine though.
I see, so it is allowed to override an empty-paren with a val. That is indeed a great feature, not only in respect with interoperability with non-scala code. It also allows a (Scala) method with declared side-effects (empty-paren) to be overridden by a member without side-effects.

I'm almost sure this feature violates type-safety though if nothing is changed to the compiler. Now that I'm better informed, I posted a new ticket with a better definition of the problem. (#3144)

Something not compiling does not represent unsoundness, I fully agree. 
The point is, given that this form of overriding is part of Scala, and Scala claims to be a type-safe language, that I think this **should** compile.
