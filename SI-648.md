Right now it is a pile of doo doo with lots of static state, meaning it can't be used in the IDE or resident compiler. It really needs to be rewritten with the static state externalized so we can have multiple copies of msil.jar for multiple instances of the compiler.

This is really important, I want to hack in IDE support for Scala.NET as soon as possible. I'm almost there, this is the biggest blocking issue.
This is kind of a duplicate of #307, but maybe it would be better to close #307.
