There is just no reason to keep this class, it is only a wrapper around a mutable reference to {{List}}. {{immutable.Stack}} has already been deprecated (in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/3cc99d7b4aa43b1b06cc837a55665896993235fc), to me it looks like it is just an oversight that the mutable variant isn't deprecated as well.
