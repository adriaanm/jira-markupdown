Steps to reproduce (test code attached):

- define a function within the interpreter
- call it to make sure it works fine
- check that interpreter unqualifiedIds contain the function name
- reset the interpreter
- call the function. This does not work, as expected
- check that interpreter unqualifiedIds do not not contain the function name. This is the problem - unqualifiedIds **still** contain the function name

PS. This relates to code completion within Kojo

It seems like this doesn't happen anymore in 2.10:

```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_40).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> def hi() = println()
hi: ()Unit

scala> intp.unqualifiedIds.contains("hi")
res0: Boolean = true

scala> :reset
Resetting interpreter state.
Forgetting this session history:

def hi() = println()
intp.unqualifiedIds.contains("hi")

Forgetting all expression results and named terms: $intp, $r, hi

scala> intp.unqualifiedIds.contains("hi")
res0: Boolean = false
```
This was fixed in 2.10.0-M1 ([f4991fc](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/f4991fcffc0cddcd16e7abccbc577581fbf5bd0f), where the `:reset` command was also added).
