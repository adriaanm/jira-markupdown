{{scala}}, like (I think all) other interactive intepreters (like Ruby's {{irb}}, Python, etc) support things like {{C-r}} for reverse command search, {{C-a}} & {{C-e}} for home/end, {{C-k}} for killing (cutting) a line to the end, {{C-f}} and {{C-b}} for moving, {{C-d}} for forward-delete-char, etc; however, a really annoying deviation from this is the lack of support for {{C-y}} (paste last killed item from kill ring) (and therefore probably {{Alt-y}} as well), and not only lack of support but unexpected behavior: {{C-y}} actually stops the interpreter just the same as {{C-z}}.

(using {{C-}} to mean {{Ctrl-}})
Oh, sorry I misread your description: most of these work, but you also want support for C-y.

This works in the [Ammonite REPL|http://lihaoyi.github.io/Ammonite/#Ammonite-REPL].

{code:scala}
@ val x = 123
x: Int = 123
@ abcdefg <CTRL-C>
@
@ x = "<CTRL-Y>"
@ x = "abcdefg"
{code}
