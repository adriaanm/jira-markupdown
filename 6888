Well, Marki is right, that's a question mark.

I simply don't have a use case in mind where you would want to use the result of an elidable call other than printing it. If you are printing it, then a '\0' somewhere along the way will get treated as the terminator in a null terminated string. So, you might cut off some more important information. Also, it could be harder to find the reason for a shorter-than-usual string than for a '?' (e.g. if the @elidable annotation was left there unintentionally).
