Is there any reason why Scala cannot infer this? It seems that the type of an argument to a polymorphic function is NOT used to fill in types for the type parameters, leading to unnecessary type annotation for other arguments.

scala> def foo[A,B,C](f: A => B, g: B => C): A => C = error("todo")
foo: [A,B,C](f: (A) => B,g: (B) => C)(A) => C

scala> foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, _ + 2.0)
<console>:6: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$$1) => x$$1.$$plus(2.0))
       foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, _ + 2.0)
                                   ^

scala> foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, b => b + 2.0)
<console>:6: error: missing parameter type
       foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, b => b + 2.0)

Obviously, the compiler knows that the argument f is a function from Int to Double, from which it can infer that the type parameters A and B are Int, and Double, respectively, from which it can infer that g accepts a Double, etc...

This might be better classified as an enhancement, depending on your point of view. :) This bug is probably responsible for like 85% of manual type annotations we have to insert into our code.

This was tested in 2.8.
Screwed up the formatting, here is the example, properly formatted: 

```scala
scala> def foo[A,B,C](f: A => B, g: B => C): A => C = error("todo")
foo: [A,B,C](f: (A) => B,g: (B) => C)(A) => C

scala> foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, _ + 2.0)
<console>:6: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$$1) => x$$1.$$plus(2.0))
       foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, _ + 2.0)
                                   ^

scala> foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, b => b + 2.0)
<console>:6: error: missing parameter type
       foo((a: Int) => a.toDouble, b => b + 2.0)
                                   ^
```
