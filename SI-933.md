The following cannot be compiled:

{code}
class A {
    def featureSupported = false
}

trait B {
    self: A =>
    
    override def featureSupported = false
}

class C extends A with B
{code}

(method featureSupported overrides nothing).

The following cannot be compiled too:

{code}
class A {
    def featureSupported = false
}

trait B {
    self: A =>
    
    def featureSupported = false
}

class C extends A with B
{code}

(method featureSupported in trait B of type => Boolean needs `override' modifier)
