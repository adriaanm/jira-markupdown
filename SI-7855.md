Under -Xlint, the check for potential missing interpolators will see the important message twice; during typer, but after the first warning, the position of the literal tree changes to the position of the block, so that during retyping in erasure, the warning is emitted again but not suppressed.

```scala
object Test {
  def g = {
    val foo = "bar"
    "A doubly important ${foo * 2} message!"
  }
}
```
I'll try to both duck and cover. Bob and weave. Opening the lid on typers and its diagnostics is like a bubbling cauldron.  Yesterday I just spent a couple of hours watching the phantasms floating in its depths. But, like I said, I'll give it another shot.

On not being past typer, this will be obvious to you, but one realizes that one must get up pretty early in the morning to detect certain facets of the code before they evaporate.
In this example the position of the literal changes because scalac actually throws away the useless val, then decides that the literal must have covered the whole method body. I don't remember when it started doing that, but empirically I see somewhere before 2.10.
```scala
object Test {
  def f1 = { val x = 5; "dog" }
  def f2 = "cat"
}
// Parser:
//
// [16:45]def f1 = [25:45]{
//   [27:36]val x = [35:36]5;
//   [38:43]"dog"
// };
// [48:62]def f2 = [57:62]"cat"
//
// Typer:
//
// [16:45]def f1: [20]String = [25:45]"dog";
// [48:62]def f2: [52]String = [57:62]"cat"
```
