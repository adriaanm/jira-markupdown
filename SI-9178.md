If you have a Java interface that could be a SAM:

{code}
public interface Foo<A> { public A aye(); }
{code}

And you refer to that from a Java interface that need not necessarily be a SAM:

{code}
public interface Bar<A> { public Foo<A> foo(); }
{code}

And you have a Scala trait that is supposed to give the SAM:

{code}
trait Baz[A] { def foo: Foo[A] }
{code}

And finally extend that trait and try to supply the SAM by getting it from the Java interface that can give you a SAM:

{code}
class Quux[A](bar: Bar[A]) extends Baz[A] { def foo = bar.foo }
{code}

you get a most peculiar error message:

{code}
found   : Foo[A]
required: A
  def foo = bar.foo
{code}

which only makes sense to me if the compiler has decided that it's got to synthesize the Foo SAM from scratch--no other way!--and then decides it's got to have an A to do it (never mind I'm giving it the already-existing SAM).

This only happens with {{-Xexperimental}}, and only (as far as I can tell) with this many steps: the original SAM, the Java source that returns a SAM, the trait specifying an SAM, and finally an implementation trying to hand off the Java SAM to the trait's method.
Here's another simpler repro that shows the same underlying problem. Notice the unwanted SAM.

{noformat}
% cat sandbox/test.scala
trait Sam { def apply(): Unit }
abstract class Test {
  def foo(): Sam
  val f: Sam = foo /* no parens */
}

% qscalac -Xprint:typer sandbox/test.scala
[[syntax trees at end of                     typer]] // test.scala
package <empty> {
  abstract trait Sam extends scala.AnyRef {
    def apply(): Unit
  };
  abstract class Test extends scala.AnyRef {
    def <init>(): Test = {
      Test.super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def foo(): Sam;
    private[this] val f: Sam = Test.this.foo();
    <stable> <accessor> def f: Sam = Test.this.f
  }
}

% qscalac -Xprint:typer -Xexperimental sandbox/test.scala
[[syntax trees at end of                     typer]] // test.scala
package <empty> {
  abstract trait Sam extends scala.AnyRef {
    def apply(): Unit
  };
  abstract class Test extends scala.AnyRef {
    def <init>(): Test = {
      Test.super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def foo(): Sam;
    private[this] val f: Sam = {
      {
        def apply$body(): Unit = {
          Test.this.foo();
          ()
        };
        @SerialVersionUID(value = 0) final class $anonfun extends AnyRef with Sam with Serializable {
          def <init>(): <$anon: Sam> = {
            $anonfun.super.<init>();
            ()
          };
          final override <synthetic> def apply(): Unit = apply$body()
        };
        new $anonfun()
      }
    };
    <stable> <accessor> def f: Sam = Test.this.f
  }
}
{noformat}

In a context that does not allow a method type, when typechecking an expression like `qual.foo` where `foo` is a method with a single, empty parameter list, the compiler tries, in order:
  - eta expansion, if the expected type if a function type (or a SAM under -Xexperimental)
  - applying the expression to an empty parameter list

In these examples, we don't get to the second measure.

Here's a analagous situation with plain-old-functions:

{code}
object Test {
  def foo(): () => String = () => ""
  val f: () => Any = foo

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(f()) // <function0>
  }
}
{code}

So even though SAMs are behaving consistently with functions, they introduce a pretty subtle source incompatibility.

I've updated the bug title to reflect the essence of the problem. I'll leave it to [~apm] to craft a puzzler around this.
\[Insert my usual commentary.\]

SI-7187 "eta expansion should not precede empty application" 

Pretty good title on that one too.
