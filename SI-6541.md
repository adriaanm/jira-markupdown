```scala
trait A
trait B[T]
case class C(a: A, b: B[_])
```

generates the following unapply method

```scala
case <synthetic> def unapply(x$0: C): Option[(A, B[_$1])] forSome { type _$1 } =
  if (x$0.==(null))
    scala.this.None
  else
    Some.apply[(A, B[_$1])](Tuple2.apply[A, B[_$1]](x$0.a, x$0.b));
```

The problematic return type
```scala
Option[(A, B[_$1])] forSome { type _$1 }
```
is not generated together with the unapply method, but inferred by the compiler (when the generated method is type-checked). [Martin suggests](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/lCIcSDHSCyg/iiVWh9iATeAJ) to provide the return type explicitly.

Also, in the body of the unapply, what is the type name _$1 is bound to?
To clarify, the correct type for the extractor should be
```scala
  Option[(A, B[_$1 forSome { type _$1 }])]
```
aka
```scala
  Option[(A, B[_])]
```
right?
I hadn't realized how easy it is to hit this:
```scala
scala> case class Foo(clazz: Class[_])
<console>:7: warning: inferred existential type Option[Class[_$1]] forSome { type _$1 }, which cannot be expressed by wildcards,  should be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.existentials visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.existentials'
or by setting the compiler option -language:existentials.
See the Scala docs for value scala.language.existentials for a discussion
why the feature should be explicitly enabled.
       case class Foo(clazz: Class[_])
                  ^
defined class Foo
```
Scala 2.11.8 yields the `inferred existential type` warning yet again because of this.
The fix works as expected, since 2.11.5. Note that in 2.11, `-Xsource:2.12` is required.
