I created the following from 
pp 10 and 11 of
http://kinded-scala.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/papers/sparsec/sparsec.pdf

(These are actually in separate source files,
!SimpleResults.scala and !SimpleParsers.scala)

```scala

trait SimpleResults {
  type Input

  trait Result[+T] {
    def next: Input
    def map[U](f: T => U): Result[U]
    def flatMapWithNext[U](f: T => Input => Result[U]): Result[U]
    def append[U >: T](alt: => Result[U]): Result[U]
  }

  case class Success[+T](result: T, next: Input) extends Result[T] {
    def map[U](f: T => U)
      = Success(f(result), next)
    def flatMapWithNext[U](f: T => Input => Result[U])
      = f(result)(next)
    def append[U >: T](alt: => Result[U])
      = this
  }

  case class Failure(msg: String, next: Input) extends Result[Nothing] {
    def map[U](f: Nothing => U)
      = this
    def flatMapWithNext[U](f: Nothing => Input => Result[U])
      = this
    def append[U](alt: => Result[U])
      = alt
  }

}


trait SimpleParsers extends SimpleResults {
  abstract class Parser[+T] extends (Input => Result[T]) {
    def apply(in: Input): Result[T]

    def flatMap[U](f: T => Parser[U]): Parser[U]
        = new Parser[U]{def apply(in: Input)
                          = Parser.this(in) flatMapWithNext(f)}

    def map[U](f: T => U): Parser[U]
      = new Parser[U]{def apply(in: Input)
                        = Parser.this(in) map(f)}

    def | [U >: T](p: => Parser[U]): Parser[U]
      = new Parser[U]{def apply(in: Input)
                        = Parser.this(in) append p(in)}

    def ~ [U](p: => Parser[U]): Parser[Pair[T, U]]
      = for(a <- this; b <-  p) yield (a,b)
  }
}
```

When I edit !SimpleParsers.scala in the Scala editor in Eclipse
and save, it adds 'final' keywords 

```scala
trait SimpleParsers extends SimpleResults {
  abstract class Parser[+T] extends (Input => Result[T]) {
    def apply(in: Input): Result[T]

    def flatMap[U](f: T => Parser[U]): Parser[U]
        = new Parser[U]{def apply(final in: Input)
                          = Parser.this(in) flatMapWithNext(f)}

    def map[U](f: T => U): Parser[U]
      = new Parser[U]{def apply(final in: Input)
                        = Parser.this(in) map(f)}

    def | [U >: T](p: => Parser[U]): Parser[U]
      = new Parser[U]{def apply(in: Input)
                        = Parser.this(in) append p(in)}

    def ~ [U](p: => Parser[U]): Parser[Pair[T, U]]
      = for(a <- this; b <-  p) yield (final a,b)
  }
}

```
which cause warnings/errors:

```scala
Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
':' expected but '}' found.	SimplerParsers.scala	scala-mdx/Source/scala/com/sas/acl/parsers	Unknown	Scala Problem
':' expected but '}' found.	SimplerParsers.scala	scala-mdx/Source/scala/com/sas/acl/parsers	Unknown	Scala Problem

illegal start of simple expression	SimplerParsers.scala	scala-mdx/Source/scala/com/sas/acl/parsers	Unknown	Scala Problem
```

Side note: I checked my Java cleanup preferences and my active configuration does not enable the 'Use 'final' modifier where possible.

Can someone increase the severity of this, because it is a **blocker** for me;
the Scala editor is not usable at all because it is inserting these incorrect **final** keywords.
I'm using 2.7.2-final

(I wish to reiterate that I have disabled adding 'final' keywords from the Java cleanup options.)
I'm afraid I'm not able to reproduce this. I won't close this as "works for me" just yet, but I'm going to need a lot more information before I can make any progress on this.
Thanks for taking the time to investigate this. I'm closing this as "works for me" for now, but please reopen if you're able to reproduce at a later date.
I'm seeing this problem again.


This time, it turned

```scala
   def expression : Parser[Expression] =
      value_expression~rep(colon_operator~value_expression) ^^ { tree => binaryExpressionTree(tree) }
```

into

```scala
...
   def expression : Parser[Expression] =
      value_expression~rep(final colon_operator~value_expression) ^^ { tree => binaryExpressionTree(tree) }
```

(The class extends scala.util.combinator.Parsers.!JavaTokensParser)

I'm running in a pretty clean environment,
with only a few plugins added, none of which
are doing anything in the Scala or Java editor space.

What's more (I'm not sure if this is related), there seems to be
a loop or hang in the builder; my project is stuck in

  Building workspace (0%)

I was able to reproduce this by enabling the Java editor Save actions:

Given a Scala project named "S":
 1. in Eclipse, open Window > Preferences
 1. type "save actions", then select "Save Actions" under Java > Editor
 1. Click on Configure Project Specific Settings... and select project S and  click OK
 1. Select Enable project specific settings,
 1. Select Perform the selected actions on save
 1. Select additional actions
 1. Click Configure on the right
 1. On the Code Style page, select 'Use modifier 'final' where possible
 1. Close all dialogs.

I had this option set because it is my preferred option for Java,
but apparently, Scala mode picks it up as well. Earlier I reported
that I was getting the 'final' keywords even with the option off,
but perhaps there were project vs global settings conflicts.

By disabling the 'final' keywords option on a per-project
basis, you can eliminate this problem, but that means that
it cannot be enabled for .java source files in the same project,
so the Scala editor should handle this.
