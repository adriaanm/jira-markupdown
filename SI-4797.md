This was also brought up on the mailing list:

One can't use zipped in for-comprehensions:

  for ((x,y,z) <- (xs,ys,zs).zipped) yield ...

TupleN.zip - which *does* do the right thing - was deprecated by zipped.

Current workaround is to define a bunch of our own zip methods.

It would also be great to have this defined for TupleN for N > 3.
We could add a {{tuple}} method on {{TupleNZipped}}.

Now:

{code}
scala> for ((a, b, c) <- (Nil, Nil, Nil).zipped.map(Tuple3.apply)) yield ()
res5: List[Unit] = List()
{code}

Proposed:

{code}
scala> for ((a, b, c) <- (Nil, Nil, Nil).zipped.tuple) yield ()
res5: List[Unit] = List()
{code}

We're unlikely to provide these classes for larger N right now. We hope that the current research into Scala macros will allow us to deliver this sort of code without the boilerplate.
This is fixed in 2.11.5, as the following works just fine
{code}
for ((a1, b1, c1) <- (List(1,2),List(3,4),List(4,5)).zipped) yield (a1, b1, c1)
res0: Traversable[(Int, Int, Int)] = List((1,3,4), (2,4,5))
{code}

Should we close then?
