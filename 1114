I haven't benchmarked (with and without -optimize) to see whether the current compilation scheme for "simple loops" is good enough. 

But in case it isn't, looks like the single place to change in the compiler is method TreeBuilder.makeFor(). 

According to its comment, 

http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ast/parser/TreeBuilder.scala

it performs five transformations. Prepending as special case a transformation for "simple loops" would not change semantics. (Well, assuming that a local definition does not shadow the usual ones: "to" in "1 to 10", "Range", and so on)
