I implemented this, and now I'm not sure we can. Your given example definitely won't do what you want. It compiles to this:

{code}
public class C {
  public <E2 extends java/lang/Exception> void foo() throws E2;
  public void bar();
  public C();
}
{code}

Here's what java thinks about that:

{code}
% javac -cp /scala/trunk/build/pack/lib/'*':out -Xprint C
error: cannot access E2
  class file for E2 not found
  Consult the following stack trace for details.
  com.sun.tools.javac.code.Symbol$CompletionFailure: class file for E2 not found
1 error
{code}

java doesn't always allow for generics.
