Just a minor annoyance:

```scala
<console>:1: error: '=' expected but ';' found.
       val var = 6;
                  ^
```

I think the error message should be about the var, like it does with:

```scala
scala> val var = 6
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple pattern
       val var = 6
           ^
```

or (when following the advice of the first error message):

```scala
scala> val var = 6 =
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple pattern
       val var = 6 =
           ^
```
I forgot to past the first error message, sorry it was late ...

```scala
scala> val var = 6;
<console>:1: error: illegal start of simple pattern
       val var = 6;
           ^
<console>:1: error: '=' expected but ';' found.
       val var = 6;
                  ^
```


I'm not sure this bug makes sense that way anymore, should I close it?
(Well, it could be argued that the second error shouldn't be shown or that "illegal start of simple pattern" isn't easily understandable by beginners ...)

Sorry for the spam. :-(
