Consider the following class:

class Foo {
  val bindata = "bplist00\u00d1\u0001\u0002Uvalue\u00d4\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006[snip]
}

The compiler is happy. When I comment out the entire class definition with line comments (//), I get a lot of:

error: illegal character '\u0000'

And on the closing quote:

error: unclosed string literal
Improbable as it no doubt seems, this is working as designed. See #3220 among numerous others (search for unicode escapes.)
