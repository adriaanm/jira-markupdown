In the EBNF grammar productions, some quoted tokens are quoted with ASCII grave accent and apostrophe characters instead of the intended Unicode single-quote characters (intended per [spec/README.md|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.12.x/spec/README.md] ). 

https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/5441 fixes this inconsistency (and one missing quote).
