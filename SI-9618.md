The snippet in the gist linked below compiles without errors in 2.10.6 but fails in all versions of 2.11 from 2.11.0 to 2.11.7 with 'found: Any  Required: BigDecimal'.

Moving the expression passed as a function param (see snippet) into its own val and then calling the function with the val (should be equivalent by referential transparency) allows the compilation to proceed.

I see the compilation error in 2.10.x. You can {{getOrElse[Double]}} or there is discussion on ML in which people use a custom method that returns exactly A.

This is SI-2720.
