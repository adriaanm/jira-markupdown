If m2eclipse requires a tool-specific project configurator, and there is no Scala-specific project configurator, then can you explain to me why it is that it's processing, and breaking, Scala projects?

This is either a bug in m2eclipse, or m2eclipse is broken by design, or it's (m2eclipse) user error.

I'll repeat, I have no time to work on this, so if you want support for this tool you'll have to send me a patch.
