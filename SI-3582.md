**Section 4.4:**

  The above scoping restrictions are generalized to the case of nested type parameter clauses, which declare higher-order type parameters. Higher-order type parame- ters (the type parameters of a type parameter t ) are only visible in their immediately surrounding parameter clause (possibly including clauses at a deeper nesting level) and in the bounds of t . Therefore, their names must only be pairwise different from the names of other visible parameters. Since the names of higher-order type pa- rameters are thus often irrelevant, they may be denoted with a ‘_’, which is nowhere visible.

----

By the way, shouldn't the syntax description in this section mention View Bounds? It mentions Context Bounds with a reference to a later section.
(In r22710) closes #3582: typedTypeDef needs to run in a new typer for TypeDefs with type parameters

this was honored when typedTypeDef was called by typed1, but other callers did not
this would cause higher-order type parameters to be re-entered in the scope of a method or a class

(by the way, should we recycle scopes for higher-order type params? now new scopes are created, symbols entered, and tree's symbols updated)

changed some spurious vars to vals
