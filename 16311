(and whoever created it should either be lauded, or chided)

is someone or something using this? nothing in the repo seems to refer to this.

if it is being used by someone for something, something in src/partest-alternative/README that says so would be nice. even something short would be better than nothing.

some reasons this isn't utterly unimportant: I routinely grep the src directory for stuff, and anything partest related, I end up with two of. also, reducing the ambient level of random stuff lying around just generally makes things friendlier for new contributors.
