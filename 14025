This fails:
```scala
scala> xml.XML.loadString("<p><b>bold</b> <i>italic</i></p>")
res3: scala.xml.Elem = <p><b>bold</b><i>italic</i></p>
```
but this works (two spaces instead of one):
```scala
scala> xml.XML.loadString("<p><b>bold</b>  <i>italic</i></p>")
res4: scala.xml.Elem = <p><b>bold</b>  <i>italic</i></p>
```

I believe this is due to a quite deliberate-looking chunk of code in `FactoryAdapter.scala` captureText():
```scala
      if (text.length() > 0 && !text.equals(" ")) {
        hStack.push(createText(text))
      }
```

I don't know what the code is trying to do, but it's wrong, wrong, wrong... I'm lucky I caught it before it caused data corruption in my application.
