I want a case class where the access to its constructors (including companion.apply) is private, or to not have the synthetic constructor created.

{code}
case class Foo private(x: Int)
object Foo {
  // apply not public
  def make(x: Int): Option[Foo] = ??? // public constructor
}
{code}

Adding or overriding Foo.apply causes "{{error: method apply is defined twice}}".

The only workaround I could find is to not use a case class;  use a regular class, and define your own {{val}}, {{apply}}, {{unapply}}, {{toString}}, {{canEqual}}, {{equals}}, {{hashCode}}; seems unfortunate.
