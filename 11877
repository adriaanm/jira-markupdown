Just a quick update on this, Adriaan's been looking at using some reflection magic to provide a shaded jar but also the "usual" one, and decide at runtime which one to use. Clients then can either provide their own or rely on the default.

@adriaanm, would you describe your approach here? It'd be good to hear how this fits the intended usage.
