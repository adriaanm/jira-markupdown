When parsing `s: String`, using `parseAll(p, new java.io.StringReader(s))` is much, much more efficient than using just `parseAll(p, s)` - difference in runtime's order of growth is stunning.
I've encoutered this while working on my project, so this is a real-world problem.

I've made sort of a benchmark from it, it is attached to the issue. Here are the results for me:
```scala
parseAll(new StringReader(String))
For 100 items: 7 ms
For 500 items: 33 ms
For 1000 items: 47 ms
For 5000 items: 92 ms
For 10000 items: 155 ms
For 50000 items: 1358 ms
===
parseAll(String)
For 100 items: 2 ms
For 500 items: 34 ms
For 1000 items: 97 ms
For 5000 items: 1681 ms
For 10000 items: 6116 ms
For 50000 items: 175927 ms
```

P.S.
Btw, gap between 10,000 and 50,000 is strange

Duplicate of #7710.
Confirmation, `parseAll(String)` is much faster on Java 1.6:
```scala
parseAll(new StringReader(String))
For 100 items: 12 ms
For 500 items: 48 ms
For 1000 items: 64 ms
For 5000 items: 157 ms
For 10000 items: 147 ms
For 50000 items: 1470 ms
===
parseAll(String)
For 100 items: 0 ms
For 500 items: 2 ms
For 1000 items: 4 ms
For 5000 items: 17 ms
For 10000 items: 49 ms
For 50000 items: 186 ms
```
I had an old fix for the duplicate ticket (#7710) lying around for some time, so here we go: https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators/pull/17

I am closing this one as a duplicate of #7710.
