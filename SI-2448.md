Java doesn't have functions. Many java libraries try to get around this with the single method interface pattern. Scala could more elegantly intermix with these libraries by providing a means to indicate that a particular closure should fit into things expecting a particular interface. The use case being if a team is gradually rolling out scala code into their existing code base that uses the single method interface pattern they would be able to take advantage of Scala's closure syntax while still using the libraries they have come to depend on.

Groovy supports this with the as keyword (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+way+to+implement+interfaces)

I wrote a simple/crude example of a implementation of this on scala-forum when trying to determine if scala supports such a feature. It uses cglib to dynamically generate a implementation of a interface that turns around and invokes a closure. It can be seen here: http://scala-forum.org/read.php?4,301,312#msg-312 It is rather limited in that it only works with a interface that has a zero argument method and doesn't return anything (like Runnable)
It's an initial implementation and it's only in the compiler jar,
but as of r23615:
{code}
scala> implicit def mkUFn(x: AnyRef) = scala.tools.reflect.UniversalFn(x)
mkUFn: (x: AnyRef)scala.tools.reflect.UniversalFn

scala> (() => 5*5*5).as[java.util.concurrent.Callable[Int]]
res1: java.util.concurrent.Callable[Int] = <function1>

scala> res1.call
res2: Int = 125
{code}
