There seems to be a quite serious error in the higher order type checker:
{code}
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18830-b20090930020951 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0_16).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> trait A { type B[X <: Double] = Int}
defined trait A

scala> type C[Z <: A] = Z#B[Boolean]       
defined type alias C
{code}

Even simpler example:
{code}
scala> trait A { type B[X <: Double] = Int}
defined trait A

scala> val x : A#B[Boolean] = 10
x: Int = 10
{code}

Or even:
{code}
scala> trait A[X <: Double] { type B = X }
defined trait A

scala> val x : A[Int]#B = 10
x: Int = 10
{code}
mmmh.. that was a pretty evil gaping hole
one-line fix:

{code}
      def typedAppliedTypeTree(tpt: Tree, args: List[Tree]) = {
[...]
            val argtypes = args1 map (_.tpe)
+           checkBounds(tpt.pos, NoPrefix, NoSymbol, tparams, argtypes, "") // SI-2416
{code}
(In r22509) closes SI-2416. this is a big one... typedAppliedTypeTree performed type application (beta-reduction) without checking whether that application was well-kinded

this patch introduces a new subclass of TypeTree: TypeTreeWithDeferredRefCheck, which tracks the type args and type params of a type application when it was beta-reduced during typing without checking that the application was well-kinded -- that check must wait until refchecks, but was never performed since the application had been beta-reduced away

caveat discovered while working on the fix: adapt turned all trees for which _.isType holds into TypeTree's
