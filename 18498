Given this code:
{code:borderStyle=solid}
object Return {
  def test(oi:Option[Int]):Option[String] =
    oi.map(i => return Some(i.toString))
}
{code}

When the {{return}} keyword is explicitly used and you try to compile it with {{-optimize}}, it causes the compiler to fail with the following message:

  {{could not find init in: Return.test}}

The full trace is at https://gist.github.com/dkristian/6348965 (also attached).

It compiles fine without the {{-optimize}} flag, and works with the flag if the method definition is changed to
{code:borderStyle=solid}
  oi.map(i => i.toString)
{code}
