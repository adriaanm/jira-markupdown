When you have two JListWrappers (or more commonly, two java.util.Lists implictly converted) and you call {{l1 ++ l2}}, as well as returning the concatenation it also modifies {{l1}}, adding the contents of {{l2}}. Couldn't find any mention in the docs that this might happen and no other collection classes do this so suspect it's a bug.

Sorry I couldn't put a proper test together but I reproduced it with this gist in 2.10.0-M5: https://gist.github.com/3149477
