(extempore in [r25809|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25809]) Flipped varargs eta-expansion behavior.

(T*)U now eta-expands to Seq[T] => U, not T* => U.  There is a
transition command line switch to get the old behavior for any who
may have relied upon it:

  -Yeta-expand-keeps-star

Closes scala/bug#4176, no review.
