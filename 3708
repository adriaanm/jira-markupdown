Sorry, I don't quite follow:
taking your example in the code
```scala
class Node(val out : Edge)
```

doesn't out have a 'this.type.Edge' type, so when calling n.out I get the edge with the same prefix type as n's?
Sorry for not posting it in the mailing list in the first place, but since I have already posted a bugreport...
