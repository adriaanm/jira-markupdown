Since map and foreach are normally strict, making the filter in the for comprehension lazy would not affect semantics and would be more efficient. 
Regarding what he has in mind:
{code}
object bop {
  val xs = (1 to 5).toList
  def foreach(f: Int => Unit) = xs foreach f
  def filter(f: Int => Boolean) = xs filter (i => { println("filter " + i) ; f(i) })
}
for (x <- bop ; if (x < 4)) println(x)
{code}
This prints the following output:
{code}
filter 1
filter 2
filter 3
filter 4
filter 5
1
2
3
{code}
I presume he's saying the filters should be interspersed with the results.  It's easy to see where one might want this:
{code}
def test(x: Int) = { println("test " + x) ; x == 3 }
def pob(xs: Seq[Int]) { for (x <- xs ; if test(x)) return  }
pob(1 to 1000000)
{code}
And you get a million tests before it returns on the 3rd element.
