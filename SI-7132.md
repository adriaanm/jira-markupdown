It's generally possible in the interpreter to find the type of an expression, even if the evaluation of that expression would diverge. For example:

{code}
scala> def ridiculous(n: Int): Int = ridiculous(n+1)
ridiculous: (n: Int)Int

scala> :t ridiculous(0)
Int
{code}

However, when the type of an expression is Unit, the interpreter appears to evaluate the expression instead of showing its type:

{code}
scala> def ridiculous(n: Int): Unit = ridiculous(n+1)
ridiculous: (n: Int)Unit

scala> :t ridiculous(0)
[ ... interpreter gets stuck ]
{code}

A simpler example:

{code}
scala> :t println("ridiculous")
ridiculous
{code}

In either case I'd expect no evaluation and no side effects to occur, and the interpreter to print "Unit". This worked in 2.9.x, and broke somewhere in 2.10 development.
