```scala
object Main extends Application {
  def foo(x: Char) = 5

  val z: Byte = 1
  print(foo(z))
}
```
Byte z according to specification should weakly conform to Char (3.5.3). But this code doesn't compile.
Yes, we can call this ticket a reopening of #3143.
Spec now says the following, closing as fixed.
```scala
Byte <:w Short
Short <:w Int
Char <:w Int 
Int <:w Long 
Long <:w Float
Float <:w Double
```
