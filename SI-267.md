In the Scala Reference, existential clauses are described as 
{code}
ExistentialClauses ::= forSome { ExistentialDcl
                          {semi ExistentialDcl} }
ExistentialDcl     ::= type TypeDcl
                     |  val ValDcl
{code}
However, it says that "An existential type has the form T forSome {Q} where Q is a sequence of type declarations", which seems to contradict that fact that value declarations are allowed by this grammar.  The parser seems to have code to handle value declarations, but I could not come up with a simple example that was accepted by the compiler.  If this is not an error in the definition, perhaps expand the discussion to clarify the meaning of existentially quantified value declarations.
I guess that stems from the fact that those val declarations are syntactic sugar: internally, there are only type clauses. Here's the relevant fragment of Martin's rationale for existentials (scala-devel mail of June 12 (maybe the current version of that document should be on the wiki?)

1. Syntax:
----------

There is a new form of type:
{code}
Type  ::= Type1 [for_some `{' WhereClause {semi WhereClause}} `}']
WhereClause ::= type TypeDcl
             |  val  ValDcl
             |
{code}
Existential types can abstract over types as well as values.

Examples:
{code}
class LinkedList[T]
class Outer { type T; val m: T }

{ class C { ... }; new LinkedList[C] }
 : LinkedList[C] for_some { type C extends ScalaObject }

{ val x: Outer =
  if (coinflip) new Outer { type T = Int; val m = 1 }
  else new Outer { type T = String; val m = 2 }
 new LinkedList(x.m)
}
 : LinkedList[x.T] for_some { val x: Outer }
{code}
Note: A value abstraction { val x: T } can be treated as syntactic sugar for
a type abstraction { type x_type <: T with Singleton }. This requires a new
predefined type Singleton which can be inherited only from singleton types.
If the syntactic sugar is expanded out, the last example has type:
{code}
LinkedList[x_type # T] for_some { type T <: Outer with Singleton }
{code}
It's an open question whether `val' abstractions are worth their
weight, or whether we should just require that users write and read
teh desugared version. A point in favor of `val' abstraction is that
they make error messages easier to read.
