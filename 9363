Was this crash only happening just after REPL startup? If so, this is a duplicate of SI-7418, which has just been fixed.

With Scala 2.10.1, I can't reproduce otherwise:

If can can reproduce this in a REPL session *after* the first line has been evaluated, please reopen this ticket. It is best if you can run post a REPL transcript under {{scala -verbose}}; that will include a stack trace in the output.
