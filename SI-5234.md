FYI, I did not see this bug, I created https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5236 separately. 
You guys do look around a little before opening tickets, right? It is a huge time drag to have to close all the duplicates.  (And I don't manage to close nearly all of them, which means it takes that much longer to find anything, because I have to sift through all the duplicates.) Duplicate of SI-4437.
