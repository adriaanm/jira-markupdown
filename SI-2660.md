See this example:
{code}
package hoho

class G

class H extends G

class A[T](x: T) {

  def this(y: G, z: T) = {
    this(z)
    print(1)
  }

  def this(z: H, h: T) = {
    this(h)
    print(2)
  }
}

object T {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    implicit def g2h(g: G): H = new H
    new A(new H, 23)
  }
}
{code}
It won't compile. But as we can simply understand it should. Because first one has one parameter, and second one has two parameters.
Martin: I assume this has something to do with tupling the arguments in the alternative with one argument list, but I couldn't find where this is described in the spec. Also, I think it would be helpful to instantiate the type parameters in the alternatives to better show how each alternative is applicable.

(In r19807) pending test: see SI-2660, SI-2691
(In r20711) Moved some test cases from pending to files since the bugs they
were watching for seem to be fixed.  Moved some other test cases
from pending to disabled because they deceptively claim to pass
while investigation reveals the ticket needs to remain open.
Closes SI-1996, SI-2660.
