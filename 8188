"You" can't rely on knowing what "you" are doing because there's no reason to expect the value of these two "you"s to coincide. 

If packages had been defined up front to be relative to an abstract root, and there were some facility for controlling where that root is, that could be useful - albeit impractical on the jvm, which doesn't offer any way to virtualize packages short of bytecode rewriting. But the whole reason people use \_root\_ is **they want to know what they're getting**. It's explicitly NOT a virtual path.

[It's in the specifiction](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/09-top-level-definitions.html): "The special predefined name \_root\_ refers to the outermost root package which contains all top-level packages."
