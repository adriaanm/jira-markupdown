I have just installed the 2.7.2 RC1 plugin. 

If I create a Scala class in a single file, I can use it without problem in Java. Great - thank you!

However, if I put a few Scala class definitions in a single file, then I get lots of problems highlighted in the Java editor (in the margin). Usually, it complains that the name of the class "cannot be resolved to a type". Also, I have had "method is undefined for ...". Confusingly, these errors don't get listed in the "Problems" view. if I go ahead and run the Java program, then it works.
