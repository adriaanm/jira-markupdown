So in Typers I managed to reduce it to this example:
```scala
class Foos {
  class Bar(val a: Int)
}
```

which gives:
```scala
Changes: Map(class Foos -> List(), class Foos$$Bar -> List(Changed(Definition(Foos$$Bar.<init>))[constructor Foos$$Bar changed from (arg$$outer: Foos,a: Int)Foos$$Bar to (arg$$outer: Foos,a: Int)Foos$$Bar flags: <method>]))
```

Seems to me like a consequence of r24262.

I will try to reduce the Types case as well.
