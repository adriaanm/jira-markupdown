I got a new exhaustivity warning when switching to 2.10.0-M7 and it _seems_ spurious to me, but it involves existentials so I'm not sure.

To reproduce this warning, we first need to define a sealed abstract class or sealed trait:

{code}
scala> sealed abstract class FoundNode[T]
defined class FoundNode
{code}
and then tuple it with another parameterized _case class_, like {{Some}} (a fresh case class would also be fine, but {{Option}} wouldn't).

{code}
scala> object Foo {
     | val v: (Some[_], FoundNode[_]) = (???, ???)
     |   v match {
     |     case (x: Some[t], _) =>
     |   }
     | }
<console>:10: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: (_, _)
         v match {
         ^
defined module Foo
{code}

The warning is triggered by matching the first component, of type {{Some\[\_\]}}, against {{x: Some\[t\]}} (or {{x: Some\[\_\]}}). Removing that match removes the warning, as do a lot of other changes. Since the first component has type {{Some\[\_\]}}, I believe it will _always_ match against {{Some\[\_\]}}, even if I think of existentials the correct way, so I think the warning is spurious.

Necessary conditions to reproduce this warning seem to be that the scrutinee:

- must be a tuple;
- must have a sealed component (above, {{FoundNode}});
- must have a parametererized case class component (above, {{Some}});
- finally, the matching must include a typed pattern match on the parameterized case class component (above, {{: Some\[\_\]}}).

I tried to alter the above example to violate any of those conditions, but that suppresses the warning; I made my experiments available here:
