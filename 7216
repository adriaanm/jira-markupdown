At this point the branch [recoveringOptimizedStability ](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/recoveringOptimizedStability) already passes `ant nightly`, inlining most of what used to get inlined before [23ae258c37bd5de05 ](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/23ae258c37bd5de050ae9d8b4287dc8c309af8de)

There are further ideas to gain more robustness (e.g., using unpickler to detect what the original accessibility of a field was, rather than ICodeReader contenting itself with a bytecode-level public flag), but feel free to review the branch. Comments are welcome.
