Reduced a ways:

```scala
object Test {
  def foo(a: Int) {
    var bar: Int = 0
    bar = try { 0 } catch { case ex: Throwable => 0 }
    new { foo(bar) }
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = foo(0)
}
```

```
java.lang.VerifyError: (class: Test$, method: foo signature: (I)V) Inconsistent stack height 1 != 2
```

This cut down version crashes from (at least) 2.7.7.
This is interesting stuff but it's late so here go partial conclusions.

To get rid of the verbose `null push, pop, null push, pop` (an artifact of GenICode's `adapt(_, NullReference))` we can use:

```
object Test {

  def foo(a: Any) {
    var bar: Any = a

    while(true) {
      bar = try { a } catch { case _ => a }
    }

    new { bar = a }
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = foo(0)
}
```

The purpose of `new { bar = a }` is just to capture `bar` so that its type is `ObjectRef`.

Resulting bytecode:

```
public void foo(java.lang.Object);
  Code:
   0:   new     #16; //class scala/runtime/ObjectRef
   3:   dup
   4:   aload_1
   5:   invokespecial   #18; //Method scala/runtime/ObjectRef."<init>":(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
   8:   astore_2
   9:   goto    17
   12:  pop
   13:  aload_1
   14:  putfield        #22; //Field scala/runtime/ObjectRef.elem:Ljava/lang/Object;
   17:  aload_2
   18:  aload_1
   19:  goto    14
  Exception table:
   from   to  target type
    18    22    12   any
```

The relevant sections are:
- the catch-clause comprises instructions 12: and 13:, they leave the contents of `a` on the operand stack (only) because entering a catch empties the operand stack.
- the next instruction (the assignment to the ObjectRef's elem) expects two stack slots (thus the error msg 1 != 2), ie `z` and the rhs value to assign to `z.elem`.

For non-exceptional control flow, the putfield is reached with those two values, which are pushed in 17: and 18:. Those two instructions where emitted after GenICode's genStat() finds a Select in the lhs.

Guessing somewhat, the "try lifting" trick in Uncurry didn't notice that a few phases later (LambdaLift) the lhs would stop being an Ident and become a Select. Thus the try expression wasn't turned into a local method. If so, not a backend problem. 

BTW `new { bar = a }` is elided from the resulting bytecode. Perhaps ... `enterIgnoreMode()` ?
In UnCurry's `mainTransform()`, there are two cases intended to invokes `liftTree()` on the RHS of `Assign`:

```
      case Assign(Select(_, _), _) =>
        withNeedLift(true) { super.transform(tree) }

      case Assign(lhs, _) if lhs.symbol.owner != currentMethod || lhs.symbol.hasFlag(LAZY | ACCESSOR) =>
        withNeedLift(true) { super.transform(tree) }
```


None of them covers the tree for

```
bar = try { a } catch { case _ => a }
```

which thus falls off to the default case, where no `liftTree()` is invoked. The reason it doesn't match the first case above is that at UnCurry-time the LHS is still an Ident.
