I'm sorry I didn't figure that out.  I realize I shouldn't be relying too much on anything but the spec, but it'd be nice if an example of this syntax could be added to http://www.scala-lang.org/node/106 .  The existing examples all put the annotation on a line by itself (which I did try) but it doesn't parse.

{code}
jon:scala-2.7.2.RC3 paulp$$ cat /tmp/an.scala 
case class B 
@throws(classOf[java.io.IOException])(i: Int)

jon:scala-2.7.2.RC3 paulp$$ bin/scalac /tmp/an.scala
