Actually, I have downloaded the Nightly Builds of Scala 5mins before. And I got the following result:
```scala
scala> Array.range(0,12).permutations
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
	at scala.collection.immutable.Vector$$.newBuilder(Vector.scala:26)
```
It seems that the current implementation of SeqLike.permutations take o(n!) memory space and o(N*n!) time.(where N >= n)
