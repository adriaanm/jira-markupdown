For example, open the doc of `collection.mutable.Map` : it mixes in a lot of traits which come both from collection.generic and collection.mutable, but it's impossible to distinguish them as the package names are dropped. So there are duplicate entries for `Map`, `MapLike`, `Iterable`.

I suggest to add a tool tip hover to show the fully qualified name, just as it works already in the methods section, so that it will be possible to know whether you show and hide `collection.generic.MapLike` or `collection.mutable.MapLike` etc.
