For 2.10-M5, apply to {{Inliner}} the improvements in branch [recoveringOptimizedStability | https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/master...recoveringOptimizedStability]

The main changes are:
# inlining re-activated after being de-activated in [23ae258c37bd5de05 | https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/23ae258c37bd5de050ae9d8b4287dc8c309af8de] . Deactivation resulted in too few inlinings:
{noformat}
locker.lib:
. . . 
[scalacfork] warning: there were 438 inliner warnings; re-run with -Yinline-warnings for details
. . . 

locker.comp:
. . . 
[scalacfork] warning: there were 154 inliner warnings; re-run with -Yinline-warnings for details
{noformat}
# refactoring of the {{InliningPhase}} that will make our lives easier down the road. For example, {{isStampedForInlining}} now returns an {{InlineSafetyInfo}} structure, previously it returned a {{Boolean}} and whoever wanted more info (eg during logging) had to rely on nobody else having modified things in between. Now it's less brittle. Finally, several small improvements for readability have been made.



Some stats comparing trunk vs [recoveringOptimizedStability | https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/master...recoveringOptimizedStability] 

||                 || trunk || recoveringOptimizedStability || 
 | total inlinings:            | 7813 | 10174 |
 | eliminated closure classes: |  143 |   873 |


One way to find out which anon-closure classes are eliminated, via patching {{GenASM}} or {{GenJVM}} :

{noformat}
if (settings.Xdce.value) {
  for ((sym, cls) <- icodes.classes if inliner.isClosureClass(sym) && !deadCode.liveClosures(sym)) {
    icodes.classes -= sym

    Console.println("[anon-closure-elim] " + sym)
  }
}
{noformat}
