There is a logic error which causes an NPE in AbstractFile.scala with the `exists` method. The current code:

{code}
  /** Does this abstract file denote an existing file? */
  def exists: Boolean = (file eq null) || file.exists
{code}

This causes an NPE if file is NULL since it proceeds to check "file.exists." This logic is incorrect anyways.

I've attached a patch which fixes this.

I apologize in advance for all the whitespace removal, my editor automatically removes trailing whitespace D:
a) that line cannot cause an NPE.
b) including a bunch of unrelated formatting changes fails to meet minimum patch quality.
c) Although it would be a strange logic to consider null an existing file, it wouldn't be the strangest I've seen in the compiler.  Did you run all the tests with this change in place? Have you examined all the places where exists is called?
