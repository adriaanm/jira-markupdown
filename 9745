Variance restrictions do not prevent the compiler from inferring a valid type. A "Manager" is also an "Employee". Invariance means this would fail:
{code}
val a: Award[Employee] = new Award[Manager](m)
{code}
It does not mean value "m" cannot be seen as an Employee. Please ask on a mailing list if you have any questions.
