Removing  alternative `empty_temporal` from `da_gd` allows it to complete.

Actually, type-annotating it avoids the lub, if that's the right thing to do.
```
(empty_temporal: Parser[Expression with TimedCondition])
```

Maybe it's suffering in the neighborhood of Expression.Aux.

Is it a bad sign when TypeComparers is on its thirdTry? Well, there's also a fourthTry.

I just followed the suggestion at http://stackoverflow.com/q/27583857/1296806
