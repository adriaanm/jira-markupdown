(Sorry for spamming you again, this should be the last time)

I've just enhanced the plugin with more conversions to while loops :
* Array.foldLeft / foldRight
* Array.reduceLeft / reduceRight
* Array.scanLeft / scanRight
(in addition to Array.foreach, Array.map and the int range foreach with no filter)

Also, the conversions should now work on method references and inline lambdas the same way.

Further progress and plans can be tracked at the bottom of this page :
