When the scalac ant task recompiles modified files, it only knows about classes defined in files that are being recompiled. Classes defined in files that are up to date are considered to be missing, breaking compilation of the remaining files.

In the attached test case, compile the code as is, using ant.
Then at line 3 of Test1.scala, change Test2 to Test4, and recompile using ant. Since ant will only be recompiling Test1.scala, it doesn't know about the class Test4 (which is defined in Test2.scala)

Now, delete the dest directory, and recompile (this forces scala to reocmpile Test2.scala as well, so the compilation will succeed).

Now, edit Test1.scala, and change Test4 back to Test2. This time, the compile succeeds. Apparently scalac knows that Test2 is defined in Test2.scala because of the file name.

(I know this would never be a problem in Java which only allows one public class per source file, but Scala does not have this restriction, so I program the way I would in C++ -- putting classes in whichever file seems convenient, and the use of sealed classes seems to encourage this style, at least to an extent.)
Put the output directory on your classpath.  As for the general issue, see SI-763 and SI-2320.
