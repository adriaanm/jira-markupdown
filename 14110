The following method causes an erroneous compiler error:
```scala
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    val in = args flatMap { x => x } toStream
    println("Result = " + parse(in))
  }
```

The error is as follows (file name elided):
```scala
  ... error: block must end in result expression, not in definition
  }
```

Adding a newline between the "val" line and "println" causes the error to vanish.
