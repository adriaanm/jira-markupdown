The following method causes an erroneous compiler error:

{code}
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    val in = args flatMap { x => x } toStream
    println("Result = " + parse(in))
  }
{code}

The error is as follows (file name elided):

{code}
  ... error: block must end in result expression, not in definition
  }
{code}

Adding a newline between the "val" line and "println" causes the error to vanish.
