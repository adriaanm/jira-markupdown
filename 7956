Unfortunately, this issue becomes visible only approximately once a week. If I had a good test guaranteed to reproduce this issue, I'd share it with pleasure.

About scala 2.9.2: Is there any difference in parallel collections between 2.9.1 and 2.9.2? I have not found any in change log. However, we won't be able to upgrade to 2.9.2 shortly
