This was relying on a bug in 2.9.2, which was somewhat inadvertently fixed in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6975b4888d / SI-5354.

Both implicits were eligible, but the {{evidence$2}} won on a buggy interpretation of the subclass rule.

{code}
(sym1, sym2, isInProperSubClassOrObject(sym1, sym2))
(value evidence$2,value idInstance,true)
{code}
