This was relying on a bug in 2.9.2, which was somewhat inadvertently fixed in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/6975b4888d / scala/bug#5354.

Both implicits were eligible, but the `evidence$2` won on a buggy interpretation of the subclass rule.
```scala
(sym1, sym2, isInProperSubClassOrObject(sym1, sym2))
(value evidence$2,value idInstance,true)
```
