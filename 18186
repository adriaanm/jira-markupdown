Joel (from Avian) has reported that the code in scala.actors.scheduler.ThreadPoolConfig.useForkJoin causes random hangs when running the test concurrent-stream.scala on Avian.

The actor library has been deprecated in 2.10, but all the deprecation messages say "2.11", so instead of getting rid of Scala actors for 2.11, an approach similar to SI-7236 has to be taken.
