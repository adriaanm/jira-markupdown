I am trying to build Scala and SBaz from their respective trunks.  Scala seems to build fine.  SBaz initialized fine and I created a build.properties to correctly describe my context.  However:
{code}
build.main:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /home/Checkouts/Subversion/SBaz_Trunk/build/build.main
   [scalac] Compiling 77 source files to /home/Checkouts/Subversion/SBaz_Trunk/build/build.main
   [scalac] /home/Checkouts/Subversion/SBaz_Trunk/src/sbaz/SimpleUniverse.scala:27: error: reference to IOException is ambiguous;
   [scalac] it is imported twice in the same scope by
   [scalac] import scala.xml._
   [scalac] and import java.io._
   [scalac]       case _ => throw new IOException("unexpected response: " + response)
   [scalac]                           ^
   [scalac] one error found
{code}

The SBaz website seems to indicate to use this Trac but there is no SBaz component.
