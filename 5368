You're not just loosing the IndexedSeq-ness (remember Seq has indexed operations for slower indexing), you're **also** losing mutability of the original collection.  You can't allow the view to chain mutation back into the original.   

SO yes.  You're no longer a mutable.IndexedSeq after a map/flatMap/etc.
