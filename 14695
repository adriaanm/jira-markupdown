{code}
scala> val a = List("a", "b", "c")
a: List[java.lang.String] = List(a, b, c)
scala> a(-123)
res0: java.lang.String = a
scala> a(-12323123)  
res1: java.lang.String = a
{code}

This odd behaviour is caused by the drop method in List having a while > 0 on the index to find the correct element. The default is the first so it is always returned for negative indexes. I'm using 2.7.7 and trunk also has this problem.

Better behaviour might be having an assert on index, or for negative indexes returning from the back of the list.
