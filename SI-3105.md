There's no way to tell what a parameter's default value is (if defined), nor even determining if it is a default parameter. It would be nice if default parameters where marked, and even better if showing the default value. If default value refers to another field (constant or otherwise) the value shown should not be the literal value, but preferably a link to said value.
