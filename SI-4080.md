=== How to reproduce ===
```scala
scala> import scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList
import scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList

scala> val ll = LinkedList(1, 2, 3)
ll: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2, 3)

scala> ll.insert(LinkedList(0))

scala> ll
res4: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2, 3, 0)
```

=== Expected behavior ===

From insert's scaladoc:

> Insert linked list `that` at current position of this linked list


=== What do you see instead? ===

The "inserted" LinkedList is being appended.

=== Additional information ===

This was broken on r22830, where `that.append(next)` became `next.append(that)`, at the same time that two lines of code were joined into one.

So it is present on Scala 2.8.1, but not on Scala 2.8.0 (on which version LinkedList had a host of other problems).

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1
  - Java: not relevant
  - Operating system: not relevant
If people want to be able to contribute patches from outside, the onus needs to fall upon them to deal with any issues they cause.  I try to be a good samaritan by incorporating some outside patches but this right here is the primary basis of my increasing reluctance.  When I write a comment like "The linked list code looks hopelessly broken to me." as I did in #3361, it means I don't want to work on it: it means it'd be faster for me to   write it from scratch than to try to fix it.  So it's twice as unappealing to diagnose bugs arising from someone else working on it.

I'm sure this bug is trivial, but it's the principle.  I only want to accept patches from people with followthrough.  So I'm available to revert r22830, but I'm not available to patch the patch.
FWIW, the only reason I didn't provide a patch here was that, being a paulp commit, I assumed there was a good reason for that inversion. That not being the case, I'll make a patch and test it against #3361.
(In r24609) Fix for linked lists closes #4080 and proves my desire not to ship
obviously broken code is even greater than my will to hold out for any
help.  I threw in a free fix for this which I noticed while in there.

  scala> scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int]().head
  res0: Int = 0

Also was reminded how useless tests can be:

  val ten = DoubleLinkedList(1 to 10: _*)
  ten.insert(DoubleLinkedList(11))
  // Post-insert position test
  require(ten.last == 11)

Fortunately a test confirming buggy behavior still serves a purpose
by breaking when you fix the bug which allowed it to pass, thus letting
you fix the broken test too.  Life's (very) little compensations.
Linked list code should still be presumed broken.  No review.
