When the code 

{code}
trait PushParser[+O] {
  def flatMap[T](f: O => PushParser[T]) = new FlatMapPushParser(this, f)
}

class FlatMapPushParser[O, T](p: PushParser[O], f: O => PushParser[T]) extends PushParser[T]
{code}

is compiled then an error is reported:

{code}
covariant type O occurs in invariant position in type [T](f: O => main.scala.eu.swdev.xml.token.PushParser[T])main.scala.eu.swdev.xml.token.FlatMapPushParser[O,T] of method flatMap
{code}

This error disappears when the obvious return type of the flatMap method is specified, i.e.

{code}
trait PushParser[+O] {
  def flatMap[T](f: O => PushParser[T]): PushParser[T] = new FlatMapPushParser(this, f)
}

class FlatMapPushParser[O, T](p: PushParser[O], f: O => PushParser[T]) extends PushParser[T]
{code}

compiles without error.
Is the issue that the inferred result type is too narrow?  That it would be a nice improvement if names 'map' and 'flatMap' were special-cased so that this.type is preferred?

Later, I supposed that one might just say: Please infer a type that survives the variance check.  But not Any.

Otherwise, it works as advertized.  There is no "obvious return type."

Footnote, it looks like "main.scala" may not belong in the type reported in the error.

Alternatively, you can make the type parameters of the subclass covariant.

{code}
trait PushParser[+O] {
  def flatMap[T](f: O => PushParser[T]) = new FlatMapPushParser(this, f)
}
 
class FlatMapPushParser[+O, +T](p: PushParser[O], f: O => PushParser[T]) extends PushParser[T]
{code}

If you're not 100% sure that what you're seeing is a bug, please check first on the mailing list.
