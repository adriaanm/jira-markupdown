I double checked and all implicits I can find are {{Source}} and {{Sink}} factories, mostly {{ProcessBuilder}} (which is both {{Source}} and {{Sink}}), with some specialized stuff. I then looked at object {{Process}} and all of them seem to be available there.

Now, I plead guilty on the over-emphasis on the implicit conversions in the documentation. In my flimsy defence, I plead that adding `Process()` everywhere makes for long lines and makes the code ugly. I'll grant that I should have make it very clear -- and with examples -- that you can do all of that without the implicits.
