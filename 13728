I invoked 
{code}
partest --showlog
{code}
and nothing was printed. Of course, the real option is:
{code}
partest --show-log
{code}
But it's easy to make the mistake and really confusing. The problem is that it was a neg test, so "print nothing" signifies no errors and hence a failing test. But in fact the error message was different from what I expected. This could have been avoided if partest had checked for valid options.
