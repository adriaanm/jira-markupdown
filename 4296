Don't assign it to poor overburdened community - this is the worst kind of ticket to assign to  abstract people, because it's 0% code to write and 100% decision to make.  It is very easy to do it, and nothing past the compiler can do it with the accuracy the compiler can.  Making use of the information is indeed something we can push out to the build tools, but they can't use something they don't have.
