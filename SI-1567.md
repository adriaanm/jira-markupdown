the indentation is wrong when the preceding line has multiple statements separated by semicolon:

{code}
    fin1.close(); fin2.close();

    // check if file can be read/written.

{code}

in this example hitting tab in the single-line-comment will move the comment to begin at "fin2.close()". expected behaviour is that it will be aligned with "fin1.close()".
