scala> List() == collection.mutable.ArraySeq()
res0: Boolean = false

scala> collection.mutable.ArraySeq() == List()
res1: Boolean = true

scala> Seq() == collection.mutable.ArraySeq() 
res3: Boolean = false

scala> collection.mutable.ArraySeq() == Seq() 
res2: Boolean = true
{code}
The bug seems to be in Nil actually:

{code}
  // Removal of equals method here might lead to an infinite recursion similar to IntMap.equals.
  override def equals(that: Any) = that match {
    case that1: Seq[_] => that1.isEmpty
    case _ => false
  }
{code}

That is collection.immutable.Seq in the case and I believe it should be collection.Seq.
(In r23260) All this time with Nil only claiming to be equal to immutable.Seqs,
how is it possible? Closes SI-3923, no review.
