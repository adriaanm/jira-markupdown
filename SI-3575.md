I am not sure if this is a bug. The code runs fine. Given:
```scala
case class Two[@specialized A, @specialized B](v: A, w: B);
println(Two("Hello", 12).getClass().getName());
println(Two("Hello", "World").getClass().getName());
println(Two(12,12).getClass().getName());
```
In the first two cases the non-specialized version of Two is constructed. I expect the first println to show that the choice of a specialized version, for the second parameter (it is not). I expect the generic version to be chosen for the second (it is). I expect the specialized version to be chosen for the third (it is).


It's not clear to me whether this behavior is in the spec or not -- must all type parameters annotated with @specialized be primitive, in order for a primitive to be selected? Or is the mixture of object and primitive just not covered?

Apologies if this is covered somewhere already in the spec. 

Output looks something like this, showing the selection of the specialized type for the third print.

(In r22802) closes #3575. stricter override checking for java members with default access: can only override such a member from the same package
cloneSymbol now preserves privateWithin -- need to reset it explicitly now when before it was assumed to be not to be carried over

rewrote accessibility in overriding checks so they're more readable, but hopefully with same semantics

I think Adriaan meant #3757 as can be seen in the follow-up commit r22803. Reopening.
I have opened #5488 to deal with the bugs with AnyRef specialization. When that bug is fixed, this bug might be fixed as well!
Now that #5500 is fixed, I have submitted a pull request which correctly interprets [@specialized A] as specializing on all types, including AnyRef. The only thing needed was to fix specializedOn to return a List of all the specialized types when the annotation didn't include any.

Now the specialized version is constructed in each case (ie the bug is fixed, closing it):
