The failing normalize was testing an invariant about alias types being expanded by the time you get to erasure. The weird thing is, if you print the pt and pt.normalize for which (pt eq pt.normalize) does not hold, you get:
```scala
<root>SI-2#<empty>SI-4#BindSI-7363 and <root>SI-2#<empty>SI-4#BindSI-7363
```

There's definitely something that's going awry, though.. commenting out the assertion allows the compiler to get to a more serious one in genicode:
```scala
fatal: <refinement> has owner value PromiseBindSI-8942, but a class owner is required
```

I won't be able to fix this before I get back, so I'll assign back to you, Martin. Feel free to bounce it back by 13 april ;-)
