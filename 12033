I don't think there is any wholly satisfactory solution here. It looks like the $Coll idea won't work.

I think I would suggest leaving the use case in, but simply removing the example from it. Incorrect examples are worse than no examples.

(I'm tempted to suggest removing the use case from {{GenTraversableLike}}  and trying putting separate versions on {{SeqLike}}, {{SetLike}}, and {{MapLike}} that use {{Seq}}, {{Set}}, and {{Map}} in place of {{$Coll}}, but the result wouldn't be completely correct, just not quite as egregiously wrong.)

[~ureche] what do you think? should we just remove the example?
