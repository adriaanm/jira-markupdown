The current parser combinators library is flexible but lacks the ability to easily define new combinators. 
For example, in a
grammar that supports JavaTokensParser.wholeNumber and JavaTokensParser.floatingPointNumber literals and an e .. e expression,
1..2 is ambiguous; and 1. is parsed as a floating
point literal.
{code}
    import scala.util.parsing.combinator.JavaTokenParsers
    object R extends JavaTokenParsers with Application{
      def RANGE = ":"
      def range_expression = value_expression~RANGE~value_expression
      def value_expression = /* other stuff eventually working down to */ literal_expression
      def literal_expression = ( stringLiteral | floatingPointNumber | wholeNumber | ident )
      println(parseAll(range_expression, "1" + RANGE + "n"))
    }
{code}
I'm using 2.7.6-final and want to define a new combinator similar to ANTLR's lookahead guard. 

{code}
   (Integer "..") => Integer // Prevent 1..2 from being tokenized as 1. followed by .2
{code}

Obviously, I can't use => in Scala, but I would like to define something like
{code}
  a<~~b
{code}
which will parse a and b but reset the Input to just after where a was found. In the 2.8 trunk there is a similar guard(Parser) combinator that is used as  a<~guard(b) but that is not yet available.

Currently, it is not easy to add new combinators because other parsers/combinators return type Parser which does not see new combinators. I suppose implicits may help, or http://scala.sygneca.com/patterns/pimp-my-library 
but something built into the framework would be better, if possible.
