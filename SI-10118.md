I've seen [SI-8702|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8702] and friends, but feel like I'm hitting the same issue with an even simpler use-case.

Is it possible (in Scala 2.10) to have abstract members whose type is a value-class?

{code}
class Foo(val n: Int) extends AnyVal

trait Bar { def foo: Foo }

case class Baz(foo: Foo) extends Bar

<console>:9: error: bridge generated for member value foo: ()Foo in class Baz
which overrides value foo: ()Foo in trait Bar
clashes with definition of the member itself;
both have erased type ()Int
       case class Baz(foo: Foo) extends Bar
                      ^
{code}
