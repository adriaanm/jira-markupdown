No, this one is a different problem (and a known one). There's simply no way to make sense of protected static in Java. It's an ill-conceived notion - just google for protected static and observe the first entry you get. The 4402 ticket was that we simply ignore access errors if all participants come from Java (on the assumption that the java compiler will know best anyway). In your example, the error is raised in Scala code.
