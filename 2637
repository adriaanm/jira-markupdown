I'll leave this closed, but note that the issue is still there. The original ticket used unicode combining chars, an e followed by an accute sign, not an accented e, like in �. Here's the full test with output:
```scala
object Test extends Application {
  val out = new java.io.PrintStream(System.out, true, "UTF-8")
  val xs = "Les Mise\u0301rables"
  val ys = "Les Mis�rables"
  out.println(xs)
  out.println(xs.reverse)
  out.println(ys)
  out.println(ys.reverse)
}
```

giving:
```scala
Les Mis�rables
selbaŕesiM seL
Les Mis�rables
selbar�siM seL
```
