The `^^^` operator in the parser combinators library still executes the function even if the parser fails. The JavaDoc on the `^^^` operator isn't very informative, but I assume it acts the same as the `^^` operator where the function only executes if the parser is successful. The following code snippet deomonstrates this behaviour:

```scala
import scala.util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers

object Test extends RegexParsers {

  var mut = "x"

  def input = 
    "a" | "b" ^^^ { mut = "y" }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    assert(mut == "x")
    parseAll(input, "a") //Parse Success
    assert(mut == "x")
    parseAll(input, "c") //Parse Fail
    println(mut) //mut is now "y"
  }

}
```
Note the signatures of the methods you are calling:
```scala
def ^^^[U](r: U): Parser[U]

def | [U >: T](q: ⇒ Parser[U]): Parser[U]

def ^^[U](f: (T) ⇒ U): Parser[U]   
```

`^^^` is strict in its argument, `|` is not, and `^^` accepts a function.  So, the behavior you see is expected given these signatures.  I don't know whether it is intended for `^^^` to be strict or not.  It is strict in 2.8.0.RC2 as well.
I'd like to urge reconsideration of this suggestion.  I don't think it's really about direct side-effects in parsers, which we can probably agree is bad or confusing at least.

The lack of call-by-name passing for ^^^ means that in situations such as p ^^^ Foo (), where Foo is a case class, a Foo object is constructed whether or not p succeeds, which means extra objects that are created and then immediately become garbage if p fails.  In my experience this is a typical usage where the Foo instance represents a constant leaf tree node. The Foo construction is a side-effect that can't be avoided with the current by-value parameter.

Is there anything to be lost by making the parameter by-name?  It would be nice to avoid these useless object constructions.
Sorry, that should read:

The lack of call-by-name passing for `^^^` means that in situations such as `p ^^^ Foo ()`, ...
Well, I suppose you are right for the specific case I mentioned. However, it's not necessarily the case that the expression passed is a single object construction.  It might use a more complex expression, say a call to a factory method, to get the object, in which case a by-name advantage would be more likely.
 
Perhaps more importantly, the Scala APIs have many places where by-name is already used to express the fact that an argument is only evaluated if needed.  E.g., `getOrElse` on a Map.  One could make your argument about the second argument to that method as well, since the default value is very likely to be a constant and constructing the thunk is really adding extra overhead. The `^^^` case seems inconsistent with these other uses of by-name in the library.
(In r24422) closes #3446 and improves parsing speed by encoding lazy arguments using CBN args and lazy vals.
should avoid needlessly recomputing parsers
review by plocinic (so you can include a version that uses the direct support for lazy args in your branch)
