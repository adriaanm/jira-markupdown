I reimplemented the method, and it's damn fast. On a paired list with 20 entries and 6 different keys, it is 25% faster than Stack Overflow implementation (although, that only works with _+_), and 4.5x faster than bare-hand implementation of it using a bunch of scala maps and reduces:
{code:scala}
pairedList.groupBy(_._1).map(l => (l._1, l._2.map(_._2).reduce(_+_)))
{code}
