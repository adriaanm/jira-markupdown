In a project I am struggling with spurious compiler crashes with "illegal cyclic reference involving ..." messages. They seem to be triggered by the co-presence of a type and an eponymous singleton object within the same namespace (package).

As noted on scala-internals, I was not able to minimise the problem. I really did an effort (https://github.com/Sciss/ScalacCyclicBug) but no success, the bugs don't appear. So to reproduce the problem, the following should suffice:

- clone branch 'cyclic_bug' from https://github.com/Sciss/SoundProcesses3/tree/cyclic_bug
- follow the steps in `README.md` (basically just run `sbt test:compile`).

In this project, the tricky situation occurs twice (`Scan` and `ProcGroup`). The mere presence of the type aliases and objects doesn't seem to suffice to produce the bugs, but rather the references to those. Renaming the companion objects, e.g. to `ProcGroupX`, is a workaround, but obviously not the intended design. Also probably replacing the type aliases with traits (`trait Scan`) would help, but again is not possible in my current API.
Seems similar to SI-5031.

@Hubert I'm sorry that you had problems digging up Berkeley DB JE. This seems to come from the curse of Ivy (?) that dependency repositories are not transitory :-( With sbt's local cache it's often not clear that something is missing, as was the case here.

The missing repo for com.sleepycat should be 

{{
resolvers += "Oracle Repository" at "http://download.oracle.com/maven"
}}

Is there any trick to include that in the pom so that it shows up in dependent projects?\

I added the resolver to the mentioned branch (cyclic_bug), so hopefully it should proceed to compilation stage now
