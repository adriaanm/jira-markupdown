Currently, a method or class with view- or context bounds may not define any additional implicit parameters. This restriction is becoming important, as context bounds are used more often. For example, embedded DSLs (in particular, those embedded using lightweight modular staging) are suffering from a lot of verbosity because of this restriction.
