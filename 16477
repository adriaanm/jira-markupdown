So I was copy pasting over portions of the Ecma-262 ref to a little Scala dsl I am working on.

The following code is causing compiler errors when being parsed

{code:title=XmlCrasher.scala|borderStyle=solid}
object XmlCrasher {
    //...Skipping parts that enumerate legal ways to make numbers and so on
    //String Escape Codes
    //\b \u0008 backspace <BS>
    //\t \u0009 horizontal tab <HT>
    //\n \u000A line feed (new line) <LF>
    //\v \u000B vertical tab <VT>
    //\f \u000C form feed <FF>
    //\r \u000D carriage return <CR>
    //\" \u0022 double quote "
    //\' \u0027 single quote '
    //\\ \u005C backslash \
}
{code}


{panel:title=Compiler Error}

[error] ...XmlCrasher.scala:127: ';' expected but $XMLSTART$< found.
[error]     //\n \u000A line feed (new line) <LF>
[error]                                      ^
[error] ...XmlCrasher.scala:130: ';' expected but 'return' found.
[error]     //\r \u000D carriage return <CR>
[error]                          ^
[error] two errors found

{panel}


I tried searching for duplicates to see if they are fixed in master. I have verified this is an error in both 2.7.7 using the repl there (well a gui frontend to it), and 2.9.1 compiling with sbt.

Now for some keywords to help search:

xml linecomment line comment compiler error
xml and unicode escapes and named escapes in line comment causes spurious and unwarranted compiler error.

Also block comments seem to compile just fine.
