The Windows version of the Scala plugin seems to work much better.  Using the Window's version, I was able to ctrl-click and traverse into method and type definitions.  Under OSX 10.5, no such luck, even though the plugin reads that it is supported on all Eclipse platforms.

I'm using the 2.7.1.r14754-b220080422080030 version.

Exactly the same.  I'm going to rebuild my environment and report back.
