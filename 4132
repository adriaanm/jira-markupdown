Replying to [comment:4 dragos]:

I use 2.8.0.RC2 under Eclipse and IDEA. And time measurer from my own library. 

Array size was 1 000 000 but I tried different ones. And I tried different amounts of runs (it was 1000 runs for 1 000 000 array size). The range size was the same and I try it with this code (just slightly modified one from Array test):
```scala
class ScalaColls(n: Int) {
	val a = Array.fill(n)(new Object)
	
	def withForEach = {
		var b = false
		1 until n foreach {
			x => b = !b
		}
	}
	
	def withWhile = {
		var i = 0;
		var b = false;
		while(i < n) {
			b = !b
			i += 1
		}
	}
}
```

In all cases measures were the same: foreach goes 8-10 times slower than while-loop.
