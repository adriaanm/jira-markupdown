Eugene, my work-in-progress branch for 2.11.0-M8 is [here](https://github.com/etorreborre/specs2/tree/remove-warnings-for-2.11). There are some annoying warnings for 2.11 which I'd like to do something about but those new compilation errors are really a blocker because that renders my "snippet" feature almost useless to produce clean doc.
