Using: Scala version 2.8.0.r19371-b20091102102036 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.6.0_0)

This is a build manager issue that can be reproduced using !BuildManagerTest.

In C.scala and A.scala:
{code}
object C {
	def cz = 3
	// def x = 5
}
object A {
	def x = 3
	object B {
		import C._
		def y = x
		def z = cz
	}
}
{code}
 1. Compile both files
 1. Uncomment C.x
 1. Mark C.scala modified, only C.scala is recompiled
 1. Compile error missed: reference to x is ambiguous

Note: The problem used to be wrong behavior at runtime, but a recent (I think) compiler change made this case an error.  It might still be possible to come
up with a similar case with wrong behavior instead of a missed compile error.
