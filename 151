I once started implementing this. As so often I didn't think too hard about how the solution would look like. At least since then I know that the problem here is that it is not clear what the semantics of this construct would be exactly. What should the actual type of the parameter look like: There are two principle possibilities: should it be Seq[Function0[T]] or Function0[Seq[T]]. The first one means, that each variable argument parameter would be by-name on its own and only evaluated when it is requested (but when is this?), the second possibility would mean that all the variable parameters are evaluated together once the sequence is referenced.
I think both possibilities could be desirable in some situations, it's unclear how to implement the first one (since the Function0 doesn't appear in the method explicitly, how do you specify when you want to access and evaluate a particular element?).
I think to really solve the issue one would have to decide for one possibility first and then make a good case why it is obvious that this case is chosen (or make it more obvious by requiring it syntactical e.g. by forcing {{def f(f: => (Int*))}} so that it is clear that the by-name-ness is applied to the sequence of variable arguments as a whole (possibility 2).
