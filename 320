I don't disagree with Adriaan -- there are one or two lint tools in development that build on top of the compiler infrastructure (eg. scalastyle), and this would make a great feature for these.

But in the meantime, here an experimental implementation: https://github.com/paulp/scala/commit/386464fe. Not really suitable for an end-user at it is based on the generated bytecode, so the warnings might refer to mangled names, etc.

BTW, IntelliJ highlights unused privates.
