I would like to suggest the compiler optimize the common case of for loops, that is, 

{code}
for (var <- Range [by step])
for (var <- int to int [by step])
for (var <- int until int [by step])
{code}

to use while loops under the covers instead of. Currently, nested for loops using ranges/iterators are sometimes an order of magnitude slower than while loops. However, while loop constructs for iterating over arrays are very cumbersome, and the functional style (foreach) is also cumbersome and introduces a lot of function call overhead as well.

The following two matrix multipication implementations

{code}
  def matMulUsingIterators (
       a : Array[Array[Double]],
       b : Array[Array[Double]],
       c : Array[Array[Double]]) : Unit = {

    val b_j = new Array[Double](b.length)

    for (j <- 0 until b(0).length) {
        for (k <- 0 until b.length) {
            b_j(k) = b(k)(j)
        }
        for (i <- 0 until a.length) {
            val c_i = c(i)
            val a_i = a(i)
            var s = 0.0d;
            for (k <- 0 until b.length) {
                s += a_i(k) * b_j(k)
            }
            c_i(j) = s
        }
    }
  }

  def matMulUsingRanges (
       a : Array[Array[Double]],
       b : Array[Array[Double]],
       c : Array[Array[Double]]) : Unit = {

    val jRange = 0 until b(0).length;
    val kRange = 0 until b.length;
    val iRange = 0 until a.length;

    val b_j = new Array[Double](b.length)

    for (j <- jRange) {
        for (k <- kRange) {
            b_j(k) = b(k)(j)
        }
        for (i <- iRange) {
            val c_i = c(i);
            val a_i = a(i);
            var s = 0.0d;
            for (k <- kRange) {
                s += a_i(k) * b_j(k)
            }
            c_i(j) = s
        }
    }
  }
{code}

are much slower than the same algorithm coded with while loops:

{code}
  def matMulUsingWhileLoop (
      a : Array[Array[Double]],
      b : Array[Array[Double]],
      c : Array[Array[Double]]) : Unit = {

    val m = a.length;
    val p = b(0).length;
    val n = b.length;

    val b_j = new Array[Double](b.length);

    var i = 0; var j = 0; var k = 0;
    while (j < p) {
        k = 0
        while (k < n) {
            b_j(k) = b(k)(j);
            k += 1
        }
        i = 0
        while (i < m) {
            val c_i = c(i);
            val a_i = a(i);
            var s = 0.0d;
            k = 0;
            while (k < n) {
                s += a_i(k) * b_j(k);
                k += 1
            }
            c_i(j) = s;
            i += 1
        }
        j += 1;
    }
  }
{code}

but the while loop code is more complex and error prone.

(Sorry, Trac appears to remove some line breaks; I
added some explicit semis but might have missed some;
I'll try attaching actual working source code)

Running this while measuring time in nanoseconds:

{code}
Iterators   2,807,815,301ns
Ranges      2,789,958,191ns
While Loop  190,778,574ns
{code}

MatMul by Iterators is 14 times as slow as with while loops.

It does not appear that the Hotspot runtime profiling and optimization dramatically helps this performance problem
This performance problem can hurt adoption of Scala for many types of uses/applications.

This is a very important performance enhancement for numerical work.    

Seems that this could be solved with some pattern matching in the compiler, recognizing a range with no filtering (in the simplest case).  Could then remap to a while form for the next stage.


I haven't benchmarked (with and without -optimize) to see whether the current compilation scheme for "simple loops" is good enough. 

But in case it isn't, looks like the single place to change in the compiler is method TreeBuilder.makeFor(). 

According to its comment, 

http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ast/parser/TreeBuilder.scala

it performs five transformations. Prepending as special case a transformation for "simple loops" would not change semantics. (Well, assuming that a local definition does not shadow the usual ones: "to" in "1 to 10", "Range", and so on)

I tried to create a script with the following:

{code}
def timeit(f : () => Unit) {
    val t1 = System.currentTimeMillis()
    f()
    val t2 = System.currentTimeMillis()

    println(t2-t1)
}    

def repeat(n : Int, f : Int => Unit) : Unit = {
    var i = 0
    while (i<n) {
        f(i)
        i += 1
    }
}

def test0() {
    var i = 0
    var sum = 0
    while (i < 1000000000) {
        sum += i
        i += 1
    }
    println(sum)
}

def test1() {
    var sum = 0
    repeat(1000000000, i => {
        sum += i
    })
    println(sum)
}

def test2() {
    var sum = 0
    for(i <- 0 until 1000000000) {
        sum += i
    }
    println(sum)
}

timeit(test0)
timeit(test1)
timeit(test2)
{code}

Result is:
{code}
-1243309312
467
-1243309312
504
-1243309312
11899
{code}

May be this 'repeat' is a workaround? Warning: works only with 'scala -optimise'. This is not very stable, sometimes some seemingly minor modifications, i.e. moving the code outside of the function, break it and I get 12000 for 'repeat'.

Thanks for the suggestion. I hesitate to try or rely on this for several
reasons:

1) having to remember to not use the standard {{for}} loop is problematic. The syntax is different and not based on generators and less general, although one could certainly patch it to be more general; i.e pass in start and end and optional increment values: repeat(start:Int, end:Int, increment:Int) or repeat(range:Range) etc. (and also handle backwards iteration when called for).

2) This may still involve at least an extra function call per iteration. If the compiler has to inject other synthetic calls into the body to allow access to other lexically scoped variables, this may also affect performance. The goal of this optimization is to achieve Java-level performance of for loops where possible.

3) most critically, if/when the Scala compiler implements this ticket's optimization, then all code using this repeat control would *not* get the optimization, requiring code maintenance to undo it.

Please see update on this ticket sent to scala-user, also available here: http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/optimizing-simple-fors-td2545502.html#a2545502

I very much agree with mgarcia's comment of nine months ago that TreeBuilder.makeFor already does a whole pile of tree transformations and there is no convincing reason we shouldn't add one which has this kind of impact.  Failing agreement on that point, I believe we have a pressing responsibility to clean up the parsing phase and plugin architecture sufficiently that it would be possible to do this transformation with a compiler plugin.

(Sorry for spamming you again, this should be the last time)

I've just enhanced the plugin with more conversions to while loops :
* Array.foldLeft / foldRight
* Array.reduceLeft / reduceRight
* Array.scanLeft / scanRight
(in addition to Array.foreach, Array.map and the int range foreach with no filter)

Also, the conversions should now work on method references and inline lambdas the same way.

Further progress and plans can be tracked at the bottom of this page :
