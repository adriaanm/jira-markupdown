Source#fromURL has defined as followsr1,
```scala
def fromURL(url: URL)(implicit codec: Codec = Codec.default): Source = 
  fromInputStream(url.openStream())(codec)
```
It seems the opened stream will not be closed, and the resource will be leaked.

How about the following definition?
```scala
def fromURL(url: URL)(implicit codec: Codec = Codec.default): Source = {
  val inputStream = url.openStream()
  fromInputStream(inputStream,
                  close = () => inputStream.close())(codec)
}
```
