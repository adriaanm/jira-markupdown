Ok. I've managed to isolate the problem that was causing my project to completely re-build every time I changed a file, even after the A/B/C bug was fixed.

My Scala project was depending on classes from a previous Java project, and was importing several classes from that java project. When I removed these dependencies, the build started working properly.

To make the A/B/C example build the whole project even for whitespace changes, do the following:
* Go to "properties" for the project
* Go to the "Build path/Libraries" tab
* Click "add external class folder"
* Add whatever external java path you like
* Watch your build process slow to a crawl


I guess this explains why other people weren't seeing this bug. It only strikes you if you try to use classes from a Java project - which probably not many people do.
