[SLS 4.1|http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/04-basic-declarations-and-definitions.html] currently allows all types of constant expression to be the RHS of a constant value definition. This includes literal arrays and identifiers of constants which in turn are literal arrays.

However, as discussed in [SI-3183|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3183?focusedCommentId=49222] and recently [on Gitter|https://gitter.im/scala/scala?at=56de0620126367383571b990], the compiler actually does not treat _final val_ definitions of literal arrays as "true" constants, because (as far as I understand) it appears difficult/impossible to ensure that they are actually not mutated.

After discussion with [~retronym], the suggestion is to update the spec to clarify that literal arrays (and identifiers of constants which in turn are literal arrays) are *not* valid expressions for a constant value definition (although they would continue to be valid constant expressions in their own right).
