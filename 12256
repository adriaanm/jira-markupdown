I think 6.26.4 case 3 applies. args are typed first with type params taken as constants, then as undefined.

It doesn't say, OK, once we figure out a type arg, re-typecheck the value args with the corresponding expected type.

The cases for overload resolution and type inference are similar, in suggesting that if you can't infer the intended target with minimal information, then you're doing it wrong.
