Even after change r19738, the following example from Ticket SI-2501 comments
{code}
import scala.collection.mutable._
new OpenHashMap[String, Boolean] with SynchronizedMap[String, Boolean]
{code}
gives
{code}
overriding method clone in class OpenHashMap of type
 ()scala.collection.mutable.OpenHashMap[String,Boolean]
; method clone in trait SynchronizedMap of type
 ()this.Self
has incompatible type
{code}

(In r19824) Made mutable.OpenHashMap a MapLike. Closes SI-2681.
