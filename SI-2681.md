Even after change r19738, the following example from Ticket #2501 comments
```scala
import scala.collection.mutable._
new OpenHashMap[String, Boolean] with SynchronizedMap[String, Boolean]
```
gives
```scala
overriding method clone in class OpenHashMap of type
 ()scala.collection.mutable.OpenHashMap[String,Boolean]
; method clone in trait SynchronizedMap of type
 ()this.Self
has incompatible type
```
(In r19824) Made mutable.OpenHashMap a MapLike. Closes #2681.
