All with 2.6.1-final:

The following code will fail to compile:

```scala
class Ref1(val r : Int)

object Test extends Application {
  val r1 = new Ref1
}
```
```scala
test1.scala:4: error: wrong number of arguments for constructor Ref1: (Int)Ref1
  val r1 = new Ref1
           ^
one error found
```

However, the following code lets you construct a new Ref2 if the type T
is not specified:

```scala
class Ref2[T](val r : T)

object Test extends Application {
  val r2 = new Ref2
}
```

the T ends up appearing to be a Unit in this case:

```scala
scala> class Ref2[T](val r : T)
defined class Ref2

scala> new Ref2
res20: Ref2[Unit] = Ref2@147bc1e
```

Granted, specifying a type for T does result in a compile error:

```scala
scala> new Ref2[Int]
<console>:6: error: wrong number of arguments for constructor Ref2: (Int)Ref2[Int]
       new Ref2[Int]
```

However, not specifying a type leads to non-obvious behavior, it seems
that an argument for the constructor should always be required, regardless
of the type.
