The following code crashes the compiler.

{code}
trait A[T]
def f(implicit p: A[T] forSome { type T } ) = null
implicit val x: A[T] forSome { type T } = null
f
{code}

Error is "head of empty list" on "`pt0.paramTypes.head`" in `Types.scala:3449`.

It isn't clear to me what the expected behaviour is. Should the compiler implicitly add parameters
  - only of the exact same type (i.e. an existential type, as in the example above), or
  - that are any instantiation of — or compatible type for — the existential type (i.e. both implicit values of types `A[Int]` or `A[_]` would be allowed)?

Or should the compiler reject existential types for implicit parameters?

Please, verify issue SI-880 is indeed a duplicate when closing this one.
