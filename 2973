It appears that through a series of improvements culminating with your change in r20987, the tree after explicitouter looks pretty much optimal.

    def stringOfSI-8377(argSI-9891: AnySI-31): java.lang.StringSI-2080 = {
      var temp1SI-12082: AnySI-31 = argSI-9891;
      if (temp1SI-12082.isInstanceOfSI-5134[List[_SI-9946]]())
        {
          temp1SI-12082.asInstanceOfSI-5137[List[_SI-9946]]().toStringSI-10270()
        }
      else
        {
          argSI-9891.toStringSI-5132()
        }
{code}
One of my goals with partest was to be able to put tests in place for this sort of thing -- too painful and fragile at the moment.  And I don't think the underlying bug is fixed anyway.  But I could use a new example, should you have any in mind.
