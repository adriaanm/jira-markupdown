Is this about discouraging impurity, or are you saying that you don't think {{mutable.Stack}} adds any value over a {{var}} of type {{List}}?

If the deprecation instructions would be to rewrite
```scala
val stack: collection.mutable.Stack[A] = ???

val x = stack.pop()

stack.push(y)
```

as
```scala
var stack: List[A] = ???

val x = stack.head
stack = stack.tail

stack +:= y
```

then I think the result is clearly worse.
