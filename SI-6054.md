Section 6.7.1 ("Method Values") in the language spec says: 

bq. Example 6.7.1 The method values in the left column are each equivalent to the anonymous functions (ยง6.23) on their right. 
{noformat}
List.map2(xs, ys)_     x => List.map2(xs, ys)(x) 
{noformat}

But I don't think this expansion is correct.  6.7 says "e _ represents e 
converted to a function type by eta expansion (ยง6.26.5)", and in 6.26.5, 
we see that eta expansion introduces fresh names for subexpressions.  So 
the actual expansion is: 

{noformat}
{ val x0 = xs; val x1 = ys; x => List.map2(x0, x1)(x) } 
{noformat}

for some fresh names x0 and x1. 

The difference matters if a subexpressions has side effects.  So for 
example with eta expansion we see the side effects immediately: 

{noformat}
scala> def f(a: Int)(b: Int) { } 
f: (a: Int)(b: Int)Unit 

scala> def g = { println("hey!"); 4 } 
g: Int 

scala> f(g) _ 
hey! 
res11: Int => Unit = <function1> 
{noformat}

Whereas without the introduction of fresh names, evaluation is deferred: 

{noformat}
scala> f(g)(_) 
res12: Int => Unit = <function1> 
{noformat}

because the behavior in this latter case is governed by 6.23 
("Placeholder Syntax for Anonymous Functions"), not 6.26.5.
I love the minty fresh palette.

You bleat me to it [sic] but here's a version with some virtues. I'm especially happy with the Option example. (But the point, that your by-name param isn't evaluated during eta-expansion, isn't in the spec yet, I think.) Also happy with showing eval of other parts of the expr, since people are supposedly confused by what underscore encompasses.

You know the guy who annoys you by coming up to your car at a stop light with a dirty squeegee?  I hope I'm not that guy.

Code review is the dirty rag he pulls from his back pocket after he's done with the squeegee.  FTR, my rag is a clean old sock.  I know it's clean because it was clean last time I wore it.
