Let's take "intersect" for example. The Scaladoc for "intersect" says:

* If an element value `x` appears ''n'' times in `that`, then the first ''n'' occurrences of `x` will be retained in the result, but any following occurrences will be omitted.

Consider {{"SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" intersect "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS"}} and the letter O. O occurs at least twice on the right, so both O's on the left should be retained. You're telling me the answer ought to be "SOSSSSSSSS", but that only has one O in it.
