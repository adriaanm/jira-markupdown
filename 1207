I was able to reproduce this by enabling the Java editor Save actions:

Given a Scala project named "S":
 1. in Eclipse, open Window > Preferences
 1. type "save actions", then select "Save Actions" under Java > Editor
 1. Click on Configure Project Specific Settings... and select project S and  click OK
 1. Select Enable project specific settings,
 1. Select Perform the selected actions on save
 1. Select additional actions
 1. Click Configure on the right
 1. On the Code Style page, select 'Use modifier 'final' where possible
 1. Close all dialogs.

I had this option set because it is my preferred option for Java,
but apparently, Scala mode picks it up as well. Earlier I reported
that I was getting the 'final' keywords even with the option off,
but perhaps there were project vs global settings conflicts.

By disabling the 'final' keywords option on a per-project
basis, you can eliminate this problem, but that means that
it cannot be enabled for .java source files in the same project,
so the Scala editor should handle this.
