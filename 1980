I don't have time to figure this out today, but it turns out it's not a repl thing.  Here is code you can compile to induce it.
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.Vector
import scala.collection.generic.VectorView

object o {
  val v = new VectorView[Int, Vector[Int]] {
    def underlying = Vector(1,2,3)
    def apply(idx: Int) = underlying(idx)
    def length = underlying.length
  }
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println(go)
  }
  def go = v zip v
}
{code}

I am guessing the failing cast is this line in SequenceViewTemplate's zip implementation:
{code}
    if (b.isInstanceOf[NoBuilder[_]]) newZipped(that).asInstanceOf[That]
{code}
I think it is inferring that "That" is a "SequenceViewTemplate?$$$$anon$$10" instead of a VectorView? The collections still hold many mysteries for me.
