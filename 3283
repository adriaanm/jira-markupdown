to answer ijuma - the default also makes sense to get a glimpse of all the problems. there may actualyl be errors in a bunch of places, trigerred by an interface change.

to answer Miles - no. I just found a work-around to filter the errors to the current project. I still think the original problem should be fixed: don't rebuild dependent classes in dependent projects when the prerequisites failed. They will surely fail and just pollute the errors list.

It is also an inconsisiteny in the example I gave: class 2 is not recompiled, because it's in the same directory and the compiler knows it will fail. class3 however is in a different project and I think the plugin just invokes the compiler like the manual test I did above. I don't think it should. You can compare this behavior with the default Java builder behavior.
