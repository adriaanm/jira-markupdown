> So all sequence operations on `ListBuffer` yield again a `ListBuffer`, but `result` yields a `List`. Is there a reason why we can't do the same for `StringBuilder`?

I can't tell.  I just burned off too much time investigating that question, and I still don't know.  I think StringLike needs to be dropped from the parents or be given another type parameter.  But more importantly, I can't spend time on this right now.  I can revert the previous change, or I can leave it.
