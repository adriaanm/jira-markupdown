I started a test suite run before going on an errand.  When I came back it said this:
```scala
  [partest] Test suite finished with no failures.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 56 minutes 45 seconds
```
Which is nice but expected time to completion is about 16 minutes on that machine these days.  This is my desktop, it doesn't sleep or anything like that, and successive runs of that test and all tests proceeded normally.  It has 8 cores so it's fairly adept at flushing out race conditions.  Here is the only unusual part of the scrollback.
```scala
[partest] testing: [...]/files/neg/xmltruncated4.scala                          [  OK  ]
[partest] testing: [...]/files/neg/xmltruncated5.scala                          [  OK  ]
[partest] testing: [...]/files/neg/xmltruncated6.scala                          [  OK  ]

I have seen that file not found failure from partest before, but not recently.  I glanced at Worker but I would have to buckle down to figure out where the assumptions are being violated.  The timers are normal heading into the start of the test suite, and no tests show as timed out: so odd as it sounds, I think that whatever led to that exception also somehow blocked the test suite for 30+ minutes.

Hopefully this is a partest bug and not an actors bug.
