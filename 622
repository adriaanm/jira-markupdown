Are there any valid used of this exception?  Doesn't the throwing of
of a NonLocalReturnException imply a coding error that should be fixed?  

If so, then I think the stack trace should be filled in.  When I've
recieved these exceptions, getting the stack strace made the fix
very easy.  Now if I get one, figuring out where it was thrown from
is going to be harder.

If these exceptions are thrown only for coding errors, then they
should be never be thrown, so the CPU cost of filling out the stack
trace is not worth optimizing for.
