I'm working on this one. Need to fix a few places, really:

  - makeAccessible is blindly typechecking `Ident(nme.PACKAGE)`. Need to de-dupe this with TreeGen
  - your change to typedIdent exposes that bug by using NoPrefix less than before
  - I'm also wary of calls to `owner` in the presence of overloading which might not be the owner of any of the alternatives, but I haven't pinned a specific bug down to this yet
