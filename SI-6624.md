    Disabled generation of _1, _2, etc. methods.
    
    This was part of the introduction of ProductN, which had
    to go back into pandora's box because of issues with cycles
    during typing.  These should have been reverted along
    with it.

{noformat}
The underlying problem, that was masked by having the _N methods around, is that we get a subpattern typed as:

 {code}KList[Option] with KCons[Option, ...] {code}. This doesn't have any {{caseFieldAccessors}} (that looks in {{decls}}, not {{members}}), so we fall through:

{code}
val accessorsSorted = accessors sortBy indexInCPA
if (accessorsSorted isDefinedAt (i-1)) REF(binder) DOT accessorsSorted(i-1)
else codegen.tupleSel(binder)(i) // this won't type check for case classes, as they do not inherit ProductN
{code}

 - Is inference of such a {{RefinedType}} itself a problem (ie, A with B where A is already a base type of B)?
 - Or do we need to allow for this the pattern matcher?
thanks to minimizer and fixer!

I wish I had thought of this when I saw that _1, _2 commit.
I had this sneaky suspicion it would somehow affect this part of the pattern matcher, but couldn't put my finger on it...

I think something along the lines of your second patch would be best.
It is indeed puzzling that we get that refined type.
Maybe we should be using members rather than decls?

I'll have a look


I guess back in the day of case class inheritance {{decls}} made sense.
Does it matter if the param accessors aren't inherited, when values with the same names are? I guess it matters if the case class fields are private, like in ::, but otherwise... come to think of it the private possibility probably makes it dangerous to think about using members, because
{code}
case class A(private var x: Int) { }
class B(q1: Int) extends A(q1) { def x = 123 }
{code}
