Seems like the spec doesn't allow this (7.2):

{code}
The actual arguments that are eligible to be passed to an implicit parameter of type
T fall into two categories. First, eligible are all identifiers x that can be accessed at
the point of the method call without a prefix and that denote an implicit definition
(�7.1) or an implicit parameter. An eligible identifier may thus be a local name, or a
member of an enclosing template, or it may be have been made accessiblewithout a
prefix through an import clause (�4.7). Second, eligible are also all implicit members
of some object that belongs to the implicit scope of the implicit parameter’s
type, T .
{code}
Your example would fall into the first category if at all, but the section only talks about identifiers and not function results as candidates for implicit parameters. Anyways, leaving for Martin to decide.

On a side note: better wrap code blocks in 
{code}
{{...}}
{code}

Thanks.
