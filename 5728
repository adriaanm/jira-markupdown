Nested classes in Java interfaces are implictily static, and Scala does not understand what protected means for a static member -- it simply does not fit in its model.
Anything we could possibly do here would be a giant, ugly hack. Essentially, introduce a different concept for protected (difficult enough as it is!) just for Java. I would really like to avoid that. So unless we are convinced that the Java examples are absolute must works, I would leave the ticket as a wontfix.
