The following fails with a type mismatch:
{code}
object Foo
val f: Option[Foo.type] = Some(Foo)
{code}

but succeeds with extra type annotation:
{code}
val f: Option[Foo.type] = Some[Foo.type](Foo)
{code}

This is annoying and I wish it were different :) Especially for the case with multiple type parameters, all of which can be inferred except for the singleton...


I refer to the spec:

The type of a designator is the type $$T$$ of the entity it refers to, with the
following exception: The type of a path (\sref{sec:paths}) $$p$$ which
occurs in a context where a stable type (\sref{sec:singleton-types}) is required is the
singleton type \lstinline@$$p$$.type@.

I invite everyone to change this rule, and observe what breaks! 

Inferring a more specific type than currently would break at least programs where that type is used in a non-positive position, in particular vars and type arguments to non-covariant type parameters.

Personally, I think it's a bad idea to infer a type into a non-positive position from a positive occurrence (i.e. the type of a value), and wouldn't mind requiring explicit type annotations/arguments for such situations, if that would make inference into positive positions work better. Granted, this would make local vars less practical, but personally I don't see much reason to make imperative programming too easy. :)

(In r23622) "I invite everyone to change this rule, and observe what breaks!"

This much beloved comment from SI-1208 has been on my radar for two
years.  The worm has turned.  Closes SI-1208.  The inferred type of an
object is now Foo.type instead of "object Foo".  What once was this:

  scala> val x: Map[Int, Singleton] = Map(1 -> None)
  <console>:5: error: type mismatch;
   found   : (Int, object None)
   required: (Int, Singleton)

Now exudes a pleasing aura of workingness:

  scala> val x: Map[Int, Singleton] = Map(1 -> None)
  x: Map[Int,Singleton] = Map(1 -> None)

No review.
