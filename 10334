Changing the order of `int2string` and `coef2rf` the the code in the comment just above leads to the failure in the first instance.

The order that implicit candidates are tried is dynamic based on frequency of applicability. See:

{code}
// Implicits.scala
        // most frequent one first
        val sorted = matches sortBy (x => if (isView) -x.useCountView else -x.useCountArg)
{code}
