Well, argumentation in SI-399 seems to me very unconvincing. As far as I know compiler should do flow analysis and just issue an error when variable is used before declaration. This is not anything special, and in fact it works for normal functions:

{code}
class Foo {
  println ( this.foo )
  val foo = 1
  
  def fn {
	  //Error: bar used before declaration
	  //println ( bar )
	  //val bar = 1
  } 
}
{code}

I mean problem should not have anything to do with JVM - it's a matter of flow analysis in compiler.
