Method already in JCL as removeKey, added removeKey and put (both return options) to mutable map. Didn't use remove because JCL MutableIterable has a generic remove method that will conflict in JCL Map. Both removeKey and put are not implemented efficiently for mutable maps but are for JCL maps (I don't want to muck with the mutable maps to get them to work like that).

I don't think we should add these methods to immutable maps, the APIs are already complicated enough without multi-return values.

Temporary workaround:


 val params: jcl.HashMap[String, String] = ...

 val force = params.removeKey("force").isDefined
 val quiet = params.removeKey("quiet").isDefined
 val suffix = params.removeKey("suffix").getOrElse("~")

 if (!params.isEmpty) throw new Exception("unknown parameters: " +
 params.keySet)
 }}
