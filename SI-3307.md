Specialization causes an AbstractMethodError for a nested anonymous method returning Unit if the implicit argument syntax (from #1492) is used.  Tested on 2.8.0.RC1  The following code fails as given, but succeeds if the implicit modifier is removed:

```scala
def f[Z](block: String => Z) { block("abc") }
({ () => f { implicit x => println(x) } })() 
```
