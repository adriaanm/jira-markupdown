The following code:

{{ 
abstract class Base[A](val value: A) {

}

case class DerivClass1[A](val valueA: A) extends Base[A](valueA) {
  
  def operator(sf: Base[A])  = {
    sf match {
      case DerivClass1(value) => println("this should work (and it does)") 
      case DerivClass2(value) => println("and this should too (but it doesn't)")
    }
  }
}

case class DerivClass2[A](val valueA: A) extends Base[(A,Int)]((valueA,1)) {
  
  def operator(sf: Base[(A,Int)])  = {
    sf match {
      case DerivClass1(value) => println("this works") 
      case DerivClass2(value) => println("this too")
    }
  }
  
}
{code}

should compile, but it doesn't: 

{code}
Error.scala:10: error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : DerivClass2[A(in class DerivClass2)]
 required: Base[A(in class DerivClass1)]
      case DerivClass2(value) => println("and this should too (but it doesn't)")
           ^
one error found

{code}
I think this follows the spec. Type parameters of classes cannot acquire new bounds during pattern matching (as opposed to method type parameters). I think what you want is

{code}
def operator[A](sf: Base[A])  = {
  sf match {
    case DerivClass1(value) => println("this should work") 
    case DerivClass2(value) => println("and this should too")
  }
}
{code}

The above works.
Could you point me to the spec that this conforms to?

Your suggestion does not correspond to what I intended. With your suggestion, we're completely forgetting the already bound type A (which means that 'operator' method would receive any instantiation of a Base class with some other type). What I wanted is that 'operator' would only be applicable to other instantiation of Base class of the _same_ type A.

The following code should not be possible, while in your version it is (I didn't compiled it now, it just for making the point)

{code}
val d1 = DerivClass1(1)
val d2 = DerivClass1("test")

d1 operator d2
{code}
> What I wanted is that 'operator' would only be applicable to other instantiation of Base class of the _same_ type A. 

Achievable with

{code}
  def operatorImpl[B >: A <: A](sf: Base[B])  = {
    sf match {
      case DerivClass1(value) => println("this should work (and it does)")
      case DerivClass2(value) => println("and this does to")
    }
  }
{code}
