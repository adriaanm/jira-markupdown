Moving from 2.11.2 => 2.11.3, I found a weird behavior relating to Java RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME annotations. Depending on some unknown compile time factors, some runtime annotations are either included or not included in resulting classfiles.

Example (also available on [GitHub|https://github.com/Brizth/scala-annotation-issue]):
{code:title=SomeAnnotation.java}

@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface SomeAnnotation {
}
{code}

{code:title=SomeClass.scala}
@SomeAnnotation
class SomeClass {

}

object SomeClass {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    if (classOf[SomeClass].isAnnotationPresent(classOf[SomeAnnotation])) {
      println("Annotation is present")
    }
    else {
      println("Annotation is NOT present")
    }
  }
}
{code}

Running above directly with _sbt clean run_ will result in "Annotation is NOT present". Removing SomeClass.class file from target directory and running _sbt run_ prints "Annotation is present".

Probably caused by changes due to SI-4788 / SI-5948.

Tested on OSX/Java8 and Linux/Java7



[~soc] I just started investigating the issue, I'll let you know if I have questions, OK? No need to duplicate the work.
Hi Antti, thanks for reporting!

Would compiling the java sources with javac and not with scalac be a feasible workaround for you?

Regressed in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4026.

[~soc]: this is totally not your fault: right now the Java source parser skips over all annotations, [{{def annotations}} doesn't return anything|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/javac/JavaParsers.scala#L334]. Therefore the ClassSymbol for {{SomeAnnotation}} doesn't have a {{@Retention}} annotation in case the class is read from source (instead of the classfile when the annotation class was previously compiled with javac).

Extending the Java parser is out of scope for 2.11.4, [see here|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7] what it takes.

My proposal: How about we change the [default visibility|https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/backend/jvm/BCodeAsmCommon.scala#L158] (in case there is no {{@Retention}} annotation on the annotation class' ClassSymbol) to {{RUNTIME}}? This means that we emit a too large visibility in some cases, like we did in the past, which would be safe. What happens currently (too small visibility in some cases) is not safe, because some expected annotations are missing. For 2.11.5 we should fix the java parser.

The other option is to revert the change and put the complete change in 2.11.5. What do you think?

Regarding the necessary fix: I guess the hardest part is to figure out how to make sure that things like {{Retention}}, {{RetentionPolicy}} and its members actually refer to {{java.lang.annotation}} and not some random other type. (Very unlikely, but easy to provide with an obvious example if matching is implemented "by name only".)
The following shows the problem:

{noformat}
lucmac:sandbox luc$ rm -f *.class && scalac-hash v2.11.2 Test.scala SomeAnnotation.java && javac SomeAnnotation.java && scala-hash v2.11.2 Test
Annotation is present

lucmac:sandbox luc$ rm -f *.class && scalac-hash v2.11.3 Test.scala SomeAnnotation.java && javac SomeAnnotation.java && scala-hash v2.11.3 Test
Annotation is NOT present

lucmac:sandbox luc$ cat SomeAnnotation.java 
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface SomeAnnotation { }

lucmac:sandbox luc$ cat Test.scala 
@SomeAnnotation class A

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    if (classOf[A].isAnnotationPresent(classOf[SomeAnnotation])) {
      println("Annotation is present")
    }
    else {
      println("Annotation is NOT present")
    }
  }
}
{noformat}
For the real fix, i think we should go all the way and parse & type-check annotation expressions. Resolution of the annotation type ({{Retention}}) will be done symbolically in the namer / typer.
