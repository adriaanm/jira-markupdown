I tried this in a standalone App object and in the REPL with identical outcome.

*Reproduce code:*
{code}
  type A = Int
  case class Foo(a: A, b: A, c: A, d: A, e: A, f: A, g: A, h: A, i: A, j: A, k: A, l: A, m: A, n: A, o: A, p: A, q: A, r: A, s: A, t: A, u: A, v: A, w: A, x: A, y: A, Z: A)
  val foo = Foo(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
  val Foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = foo
{code}

*Expected result:*
compiles fine

*Actual result:*
{noformat}
[error] object <none> is not a member of package scala
[error]   val Foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = foo
[error]          ^
[error] one error found
{noformat}

Same happens for 
{code}
val Foo(1,2,3,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = foo
{code}

But not for
{code}
val Foo(1,2,3,4,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z) = foo
{code}
which compiles fine, as it matches only 22 values.

This is not a blocker since it's a new feature (thus not a regression) and it has a workaround:
{code}
 foo match { case Foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z) => }
{code}
