While working on SI-5130 I spotted this method:

{code}
  // Optimization to avoid creating unnecessary new typerefs.
  def copyTypeRef(tp: Type, pre: Type, sym: Symbol, args: List[Type]): Type = tp match {
    case TypeRef(pre0, sym0, _) if (pre0 eq sym0) && sym0.name == sym.name =>
      if (sym.isAliasType && sameLength(sym.info.typeParams, args) && !sym.lockOK)
        throw new TypeError("illegal cyclic reference involving " + sym)

      TypeRef(pre, sym, args)
    case _ =>
      typeRef(pre, sym, args)
  }
{code}

1.- The first case will never be followed: both Type and Symbol are classes and they don't extend each other, so a Type and a Symbol can ever be "eq" to each other... Â¿am I right?

2.- Where is the optimization it promises in the heading comment?

Gasp, it looks like I just broke this a week ago in r25984.  I'm sad that my equality sanity checks don't catch that nonsensical eq test, and I know why too.  In any case that's obviously supposed to be comparing pre and pre0.  The optimization in question is that it is created a TypeRef directly (capital TypeRef) rather than going through the factory (lower case typeRef) because the former mechanism bypasses the unique type cache.

I've tried removing the (useless) first case and adding this one instead to deliver on the promised optimization:

{code}
    case TypeRef(`pre`, `sym`, `args`) =>
      tp
{code}

Observations:
- The new case is run hundreds of times even on the simplest 'pos' tests, thousands on larger ones.
- All partests pass.
- The default case is also run -- the optimization applies about 1/3rd of the time.

I'll now try to measure total run times to decide whether the optimization is worth the cost of the comparison (plan B: make the comparison simpler; plan C: remove the method altogether).
(extempore in [r26031|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26031]) Fix for unfortunate thinko recently introduced.

Many thanks to Jordi Salvat i Alabart for catching this.
Universal equality is a formidable foe when it comes to avoiding
this kind of mistake.  Closes SI-5206, no review.
Now that this is fixed it may be unimportant, but since I've made the measurements, I'll drop them here even if just for the record:

*ant clean quick.lib*

With the optimization in my 10:35pm message:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.938 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:49.082 sec]

With copyTypeRef(pre,sym,args) just an alias for typeRef(pre,sym,args):
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:54.058 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:49.825 sec]

With the optimization guarded by "eq" on all three parameters:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.777 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.518 sec]

... not even measurable difference... 

*ant clean quick.comp:*

With the optimization guarded by "eq" on all three parameters:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:51.412 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer: 3:14.034 sec]
Total time: 7 minutes 7 seconds

With the snippet above:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:50.794 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer: 3:12.194 sec]
Total time: 7 minutes 5 seconds

With copyTypeRef just calling typeRef -- and making it final:
[stopwatch] [quick.lib.timer: 3:50.895 sec]
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer: 3:13.251 sec]
Total time: 7 minutes 6 seconds

... again, not really measurable.

I'll try the fix and see what it brings (right now my build is broken :-( )
It is likely there is a measurable impact in environments making heavier use of implicit search than the compiler does.  I say this because the optimization originated with tiark attacking their compile times, and if he shipped it then the smart money is that it was motivated.

It would be really good if we were collecting regular timings for compiling not-the-compiler things though, as the assessment above is a little inaccessible to everyone but me.
