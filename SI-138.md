I'm using the Eclipse TPTP package to profile our production code and having
this module installed gets this error on any Scala objects:

{code}
$$ java '-agentlib:JPIBootLoader=JPIAgent:server=enabled;CGProf:execdetails=false' -classpath /usr/local/share/scala/lib/scala-library.jar:. TestJava
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: (class: ObjectClintTest$$, method: <clinit> signature: ()V) Inconsistent stack height 1 != 2
        at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)
        at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:169)
        at TestJava.main(test_java.java:12)
{code}

To reproduce on Linux:

1) Install the TPTP agent library from the 'Agent Controller' section here:

   http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/?ver=4.4.0.2

2) Unpack the unzip file.

3) Set up your environment.  Use the description in the getting_started.html.
   This ends up adding paths to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and adding a new
   JAVA_PROFILER_HOME environmental variablt.

4) Compile the following Scala code:

{code}
@SerialVersionUID(123L)
object ObjectClintTest
{
}
{code}

5) Compile the following Java code:

{code}
class TestJava
{
    public static final void main(String[] args)
        {
            try {
                System.out.println(Class.forName("ObjectClintTest$$"));
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
};
{code}

6) Run the Java program as, changing the -classpath to pick up
   scala-library.jar:

{code}
$$ java '-agentlib:JPIBootLoader=JPIAgent:server=enabled;CGProf:execdetails=false' -classpath /usr/local/share/scala/lib/scala-library.jar:. TestJava
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: (class: ObjectClintTest$$, method: <clinit> signature: ()V) Inconsistent stack height 1 != 2
        at java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)
        at java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:169)
        at TestJava.main(test_java.java:12)
{code}

The problem appears to be the DUP in clint(), leaving an object on the
stack that doesn't need to be there.

Also, this removes a DUP.

I applied the patch. In my opinion there is a bug in the TPTP library too. Verification does not require that the stack is empty before a return. The error message seems strange, since the code is linear, so we can't have two different stacks at a merge point. Maybe the library instruments the code and makes some invalid assumptions. Anyway, the {{DUP}} was useless so it's good to have fixed this.
