When I compare a `java.lang.Object` with a Scala type, the Scala compiler report the following warning:

```scala
Object and com.thoughtworks.binding.Binding.BindingSeq[String] are unrelated: they will most likely never compare equal
```

The warning is incorrect. The comparison does return `true` for my case.
