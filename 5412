I don't have many builds around to bisect (I wish all the old nightlies were available form scala-lang.org).

So at a very coarse resolution, all I can say is that it broke between r23032-b20100919020152 and r23930-b20110109020122.

This is enough to reproduce:

{code}
object test {
  trait A[OUT[_]] {
    null.asInstanceOf[B[OUT]].b1("")
  }

  trait B[OUT[_]] {
    def b1[A](a: A) = b2[OUT]
    def b2[OUT1[_]] = ()
  }
}
{code}
