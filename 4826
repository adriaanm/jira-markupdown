Here's a smaller test case (adapted from the code from ticket SI-1789, based on the code submitted with this ticket), that fails for me in the REPL in both 2.8.0 final and 2.8.1 RC1, with a "Cannot anchor an already anchored label!" AssertionError.

{code}
object S {
  def test: Unit = {
    try { if(true) return }
    finally { while(true) {} }
  }
}
{code}
