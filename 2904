It seems somehow I never mentioned higher-order **pattern** unification by Miller, which is what Agda uses â€” the paper I linked ("Unification via explicit substitutions: The case of higher-order patterns") is indeed about that. For whatever reason, everybody steers away from the original Huet algorithm, including modern implementation of lambdaProlog (which is what "Partial Polymorphic Type Inference and Higher-Order Unification" uses).
