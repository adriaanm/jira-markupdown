"run", "jvm", "jvm5" and "res" tests fail with Partest (and SuperSABBUS) if Scala directory's path contains spaces.

To test, SVN checkout Scala trunk into "scala dir" and run "ant -f sabbus suite.test".

(extempore in [r25994|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25994]) Working on the runners.

Removed assumption that bash is in /bin. Removed --posix option to bash.
Modernized shell constructs: $() instead of ``, [[ ]] instead of [ ].
Added -debug option for all runners which will show you the exact java
command line being run before running it. Added -usebootcp to complement
-nobootcp, and made regular classpath the default on cygwin. Quoted more
things to give us a fighting chance against spaces and parens in paths.

I took the waste-half-a-day step of installing vmware fusion so I could
install windows so I could install cygwin so I could install scala under
cygwin so I could see if it still worked. Seems to. We still desperately
need some way of testing not only everything I'm attempting to address
in this pile of patches but everything which is most likely now regressing.

:javap now sort of works on windows (not for repl-defined classes as yet)
if JAVA_HOME is set such that I can find tools.jar. Closes SI-4959.
(Risks breaking and) references SI-2092. References SI-622 since that
shouldn't be hard to get working.
(szeiger in [r26040|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26040]) Always build command lines in partest as Seq[String] instead of space-separated command.

Closes SI-1510 which is actually caused by a bad command line string when the path to Java contains a space, and not by long path names per se. References SI-622 since this commit fixes the specific error described there (not closing because follow-up bugs remain).
(szeiger in [r26047|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=26047]) Make partest work with spaces in the path (from batch script and ant task).

- The 'partest' ant task gets a new 'compilerargs' element for scalac options (like in scalacfork and javac).
- Fixed argument list handling in partest task.
- Further improvements to argument list handling for all ant tasks.
- Fixed argument list handling in DirectTest (used by partest shell scripts)
- Fixed path handling in several test cases.

Closes SI-622. Review by phaller.
