In section 10.1:
* {{CharRef}} is used in the production for {{AttValue}}, and not defined anywhere. Should be added to the production defining nonterminals to be "as in W3C XML".
* {{CharNoRef}} is used in the production for {{CharData}} in section 10.1, and not defined anywhere. It should be replaced by {{Char1}}. (Aside: the XML spec uses regexps such as [^&<"] to represent character classes {{CharQ}} and {{CharA}}. It would make sense to do the same here.)
* {{CombiningChar}} is defined in the production "as in W3C XML", but not used anywhere.
* {{XNameStart}} is defined to include {{BaseChar}} -- which contradicts the annotation "(as in W3C XML, but without ':'" and is incorrect, since {{BaseChar}} includes e.g. digits, which can't start names neither in XML or in Scala. Should be either copied from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameStartChar removing the initial ":" or defined as "{{NameStartChar}} _without_ {{':'}}" and {{NameStartChar}} included to the "as in W3C XML" production.
