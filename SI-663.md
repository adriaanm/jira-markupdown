The following XML document makes it spit an error message, although it is valid XML according to the spec:

```scala
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><feed/>
```
```scala
:1:39: whitespace expected<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><feed/>                                      ^
res9: scala.xml.Document = <feed></feed>
```

It seems to parse it correctly, though. I think this warning is unnecessary (and badly formatted). This XML document comes from a source I don't control, so I am totally stuck: the default parser (that uses SAX) fails (see #632), and this one fails for a different reason.

Here's an interpreter session that shows this error:
```scala
scala> var src = Source.fromString("<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><feed/>")
src: scala.io.Source = has

scala> val parser = xml.parsing.ConstructingParser.fromSource(src, true)
parser: scala.xml.parsing.ConstructingParser = scala.xml.parsing.ConstructingParser@74fb70

scala> parser.document
:1:39: whitespace expected<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><feed/>                                      ^
res9: scala.xml.Document = <feed></feed>
```
