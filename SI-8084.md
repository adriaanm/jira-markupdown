```scala
scala> import collection.mutable
import collection.mutable

scala> val x = mutable.Buffer(4,5,6)
x: scala.collection.mutable.Buffer[Int] = ArrayBuffer(4, 5, 6)

scala> x.toSeq
res0: Seq[Int] = ArrayBuffer(4, 5, 6)

scala> x.toIndexedSeq
res1: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(4, 5, 6)

scala> val x = Array(4,5,6)
x: Array[Int] = Array(4, 5, 6)

scala> x.toSeq
res2: Seq[Int] = WrappedArray(4, 5, 6)

scala> x.toIndexedSeq
res3: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(4, 5, 6)
```

Note that Arrays (= WrappedArrays) and Buffers are incorrectly declared as not subclassing IndexedSeq. This is a clear bug as IndexedSeq is specifically defined as a sequence for which index operations are (near-)constant, which applies to both Buffers and Arrays. This means that I have a function that does random-access an array-like parameter and I logically declare it to take an IndexedSeq, it fails when I pass in something that's a Buffer or Array. This is not a mutable/immutable thing because calling `toSeq()` returns the same item back. (Mutable objects can be viewed as immutable objects.)

I hesitated before marking this as "Critical". I eventually did so because by default bugs show up as "Major" and this is a fairly serious bug; I can't believe it hasn't been fixed already.

If this breaks binary compatibility, it may need to wait till 2.12. On the other hand, for the moment, implicit conversions can be added from Buffer and WrappedArray to IndexedSeq that automatically call toIndexedSeq(), so that code that's written the way it should at least works, if not with maximum efficiency.
Most of your data is wrong. Buffers are not necessarily indexed. One of the most frequently used buffers is "ListBuffer", which like it suggests is backed by a List. Next, both ArrayBuffer and WrappedArray extend IndexedSeq. But they don't extend **immutable**.IndexedSeq, because they are not immutable. The abstract signature of "toIndexedSeq" is "def toIndexedSeq: immutable.IndexedSeq[A]", making both ineligible.

It IS "a mutable/immutable thing", and toSeq is defined differently: it returns collection.Seq. See many historical threads on the inconsistency that scala.Map and scala.Set are immutable but scala.Seq is not.

"Mutable objects can be viewed as immutable objects."

What? If that were true there would be no point in drawing a distinction. They CAN be in the sense that you can implement the immutable interface around anything you want, but they can't be in the sense of enjoying correctness. That your immutable reference won't have different contents the next time you look is the entire point.
I agree with Paul's assessment here.

The mutable/immutable/don't-know distinction in the types is discussed: http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/overview.html

Here's how to treat a WrappedArray as a collection.IndexedSeq

```scala
scala> val as = Array(1, 2, 3): collection.mutable.WrappedArray[Int]
as: scala.collection.mutable.WrappedArray[Int] = WrappedArray(1, 2, 3)

scala> as: collection.IndexedSeq[Int]
res2: IndexedSeq[Int] = WrappedArray(1, 2, 3)
```

OK, sorry about that.

Jason, I do know the difference between mutable/immutable/don't-know.

My basic confusion here is the definition of toIndexedSeq; I missed that this is defined as returning a specifically immutable IndexedSeq. To my eyes, this is obviously wrong: If a WrappedArray or an ArrayBuffer is some type of IndexedSeq, then calling toIndexedSeq on it should do nothing. I understand from what Paul says that there is a historical inconsistency here, and that some may disagree with my assertion about to IndexedSeq.

I have to say, the very first time I encountered the aliasing of mutable/immutable/don't-know collections, as a long-time programmer my instinctive reaction was "this is ugly and is going to lead to problems". Aliasing like this is usually a bad idea as it encourages sloppy thinking and makes it easy to miss critical distinctions, as I did above. The fact that whoever designed the toSeq vs. toMap vs. toIndexedSeq got some of them wrong is a good demonstration of this.

I do know that the point of doing this was supposed to make it easier to convert code between mutable and immutable, but in reality

#This is going to lead to trouble when someone does it blindly without thinking of the consequences (e.g. race conditions coming from mutability);
#Search-and-replace is your friend;
#Aliasing in import statements is also your friend. This is the proper way to handle aliasing if you really want it.

A good convention to follow:

```scala
import collection.{mutable, immutable}

def foo(s: immutable.Seq[Int]): mutable.Seq[String] // etc
```
