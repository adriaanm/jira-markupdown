The problem with Java reflection reminds me of SI-4023, where it creates problems with "object".

Does someone know the current javac behaviour is defined in the spec?

If not, it would probably make sense to create a ticket in Oracle's bug tracker, even if we can sidestep the problem with Scala reflection, because huge optimizations efforts went into making reflection fast ... so if we can use Java reflection underneath instead of rolling things ourselves, we could benefit from that hard work.
