(based on feedback from multiple clients of macro/reflection API) This is very counter-intuitive and needs to be fixed, at least, in the public API. No idea whether this quirk is essential for the compiler, but it shouldn't be exposed to the outside world.
We can/should fix it.  I should have been clearer earlier, sometimes I explain why things are the way they are without elaborating that they don't have to be that way and/or that I'd rather they were a different way.
