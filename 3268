Strangely enough this is according to spec.  The left hand side of a value declaration can be a pattern.  One kind of pattern is a literal pattern, and true is one such (as are false and null: the other reserved words are not.)

If the lhs is a pattern, the declaration is interpreted as a pattern match, and the match will either succeed or throw a match error.
{code}
scala> val S = "hi" ; val "hi" = S
S: java.lang.String = hi
scala> val 5: Int = 5

scala> val 5: Long = 5
scala.MatchError: 5
{code}
Granted this is a little surprising, but I don't think it's a bug, and it's pretty inoffensive as surprises go.  It has already been assigned to scala_meeting so I'll leave it, but I'll be surprised if this is anything but wontfix.
