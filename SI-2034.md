The following code fails with java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: TestScalaBug$$foo

workaround is to add a class foo 

may be related to bug 1572



{code}
object TestScalaBug {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val fooz = new foo.foo2
    println(fooz)
  }

  object foo {
    class foo2 {
      override def toString = getClass.getSimpleName
    }
  }
    
}
{code}

The error is
{code}
java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name
        at java.lang.Class.getSimpleName(Unknown Source)
{code}
like Ticket SI-286 - getSimpleName expects a $$ between TestScalaBug$$foo$$ and foo2's class name?

Could TestScalaBug$$foo$$foo2 instead be named TestScalaBug$$foo$$$$foo2 ? I understand that this conflicts with the goal of having nice names when accessing Scala classes from Java.


The alternate approach would be to generate a TestScalaBug$$foo class, with TestScalaBug$$foo$$foo2 being an inner class of that class. But I suspect that approach may have already been considered and rejected in Ticket SI-1572

See also SI-3845.
See SI-4118, it is most likely at least related if not a duplicate.
This is a really nasty issue that prevents Scala from being used with a great many modern frameworks that rely on reflection and annotation scanning for service detection. This issue is a showstopper for anybody who wants to use Scala in a Java EE environment (like me).  

(I apologize that this is a bit of a "me too," but I think this issue is serious enough that it warrants the bump. This, along with the related SI-6546, are in danger of killing the Scala pilot at my company. I can't even load our code into the same container without breaking the whole deployment.)

If binary compatibility is the concern, maybe we can have a compiler flag or something?  If a new compiler could support both versions, I could happily throw the switch and not worry about old compilers being able to use my libraries.  I might even be willing to write some code here, but I'm not sure that it would actually save any time by the time someone finished pointing me in the right direction as I don't really know the Scala compiler. :-)
It isn't compiler knowledge that is necessary so much as a great deal
of time and patience. The algorithm by which names are derived requires
comprehensive modification. A single character, $, is used to encode dozens
of different pieces of information. That character is also used by java.
There is no way to correctly handle all competing uses while still only
using $, especially given the hardcoded assumptions in java.lang.Class
which cause the getSimpleName issue. The workable answer in my opinion is
to reserve characters from a larger set and start using meaningfully: see
http://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/symbolic_freedom_in_the_vm . There is much
which would have to be kept working and little documentation about what it is.
That however is the task.

Double nested class fail: with java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name

{code}
object A {
  object B {
    class C {

    }
  }
}

val c = new A.B.C()
c.getClass.getSimpleName() // Throws: java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name
{code}
There must be some truth in saying "better late than never", so almost 5 years after Martin's question, here are some thoughts:

- the deeply nested class `C` is a member of object B, whose binary name is `A$B$`. However, the name module suffix (the last `$`) is added during bytecode generation. In the AST, one only sees the *flattened* name, which is `A$B`.
- using the flattened name as the outer name won't work, since the flattened name corresponds to a companion class, which may not exist (in this case, there isn't one). Emitting such a name migth break `getEnclosingClass`. The bytecode generator therefore uses the binary name for `outer_name` inside the `InnerClasses` attribute
- since objects are "the equivalent of static" in the Java world, we wanted to make it easier for Java code to use static inner classes. When there's only one level of nesting, there's a guaranteed companion: every top-level object gets a mirror class (if there isn't one) that creates static forwarders to module methods (that's how one can run a `main` method defined inside an object). Therefore, a special case for one-level nesting: those classes use the flattened name (without a `$` suffix) as outer_name. So, Java code can say `new Outer.Inner`.

The issue in this case is the inconsistency between the InnerClasses attribute and the binary name of the *inner* class. In Olivier's example, the flattened name of C is `A$B$C`, which ends up as the binary name of C. However, the JLS requires a separating `$` between the outer name and the inner name, which is missing in this case.

The code that decides the binary name of C is this:

{code}
    override def name: TermName = {
      if (Statistics.hotEnabled) Statistics.incCounter(nameCount)
      if (!isMethod && needsFlatClasses) {
        if (flatname eq null)
          flatname = nme.flattenedName(rawowner.name, rawname)

        flatname
      }
      else rawname
    }
  }
{code}

This code does not know about the logic of encoding `objects`, so it simply uses the flattened name of the owner followed by `$` and inner name (`A$B` + `$` + `C`). This misses a `$`, because the binary name of B (after code generation) is `A$B$`, and the InnerClasses attribute will use it too. At this point, the invariant that the JLS specifies in 13.1, `binary_name` == `outer_name` + `$` + `inner_name`, is broken.

The whole scheme needs a rehaul. The fact that these names are computed at different times and with completely disconnected logic will bite us in the future too.
- one solution would be to move the module-generation code from the backe-end to the AST, and expose nesting at the tree level (some initialization code in the module constructor might not be expressible as AST nodes, so that's a concern).
- a more local fix might be to give up the "optimization" for Java convenience and simplify the problem -- and less likely to make mistakes. Still, the disconnect between the logic of flattening names, module code generation and InnerClasses attribute generation is risky

An even more ambitious plan would be to rehaul all synthetic name generation. I find the way we generate anonfun names to be unnecessarily verbose. Having a spec would be a great step forward, and justify breaking some tools if the new scheme is sane and well defined. There's material for a SIP here (not a very glamorous one, but a very useful one).
Paul, I had a look at your fix, but I thought a summary would be beneficial for whoever wants to fix this. One thing that jumped at me was

{code}
-          flatname = nme.flattenedName(rawowner.name, rawname)
+          flatname = nme.flattenedName(rawowner.javaSimpleName,rawname)
{code}

This seems to only look at the simple name of the owner, while the previous code would recurse through `.name`. I didn't build your code though, so I might have missed a compensating change in the rest of the patch. Since I don't plan to fix this myself (just realized it was assigned to me!), I didn't investigate further.
I think it's easier to look at the test case than at the code, especially a year later. The patch also includes all the changes necessary for all the tests to pass, which shows in various ways how it differs from code presently being generated.
{code}
// All eight combinations of class/object nesting to three levels.

  object o1 {
    object o2 { object o3; class o3 }
    class o2  { object o3; class o3 }

Oh, and in case it's not clear, that's not the "artist's conception" or anything like that. Those names are obtained from getEnclosingClass and getSimpleName.
{code}
+  def show[T: ClassTag](nesting: String) = showClass(nesting, classTag[T].runtimeClass)
+  def showRef(nesting: String, x: AnyRef) = showClass(nesting, x.getClass)
+  def showClass(nesting: String, c: Class[_]) {
+    print(nesting, c.getEnclosingClass.getName, c.getSimpleName, c.getName)
+  }
{code}
How far is that?

Maybe you could pinpoint which it is that you think is wrong among these names. Or define what is "inner class metadata" if it's something other than getEnclosingClass.getName + getSimpleName, which is what these names are built from.

I am not sure how to explain this any more than it is already explained, but I can offer some concrete measures for "me" vs. "status quo".

Me: no exceptions from java reflection.
Status quo: lots of exceptions from java reflection.

For this code sample:
{code}
package s {
  object o1 {
    object o2 { object o3; class o3 }
    class o2  { object o3; class o3 }
  }
  class o1 {
    object o2 { object o3; class o3 }
    class o2  { object o3; class o3 }
  }
}
{code}

Me: It compiles and creates the appropriate classfiles for eight distinct entities, each of which has correct and consistent names.
Status quo: It does this.

{code}
scalac ./a.scala
./a.scala:4: error: name clash: class o2 defines object o3
and its companion object o2 also defines class o3
    class o2  { object o3; class o3 }

./a.scala:4: error: name clash: class o2 defines class o3
and its companion object o2 also defines class o3
    class o2  { object o3; class o3 }
                                 ^
./a.scala:7: error: name clash: class o1 defines object o2

           ^
./a.scala:8: error: name clash: class o1 defines class o2
and its companion object o1 also defines class o2

                                 ^

It seems like status quo should be armed with more than some nebulous and as-yet unfalsifiable analysis.
Paul, the issue is that Java requires classes to define their inner classes in metadata. See for example [§4.7.6 of the Java 7 VM spec|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.6]. If these names don't match with the actual names of classes, utilities that try to use reflection or detection to find inner classes may start to fail.
For some reason I've continued to nurse this patch. I attached a new one against current 2.12.x, d30098c30d. It still fails when it comes time to run the usual test suite because of the binary artifacts, but since my last comment a bunch of junit tests have been added and here's where junit really shines: it doesn't have to break the way anything scala will. So all the junit tests pass, and that's as much as I know.

Now I'm deleting the branch.

Oh, maybe you are defining things differently. To me "bootstrapping" is an actually working scala on the other side of whatever invasive change requires a reference to bootstrapping. I wasn't trying to say that your bootstrapping infrastructure is necessarily the issue - although whether or not it is, the general difficulty identifying the complete set of inputs makes this sort of effort that much harder.

Fixed in java 9, as I hypothesized in may 2015, which crowns SI-2034 as the dumbest misallocation of my time among the many strong competitors for that title. Long may it reign.
