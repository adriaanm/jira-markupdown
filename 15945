```scala
object A extends Application {
  42 match { } 
}
```

In 2.8.1, there is a syntax error: 'case' expected but '}' found.
In scala-2.9.0.r24198, it compiles but instead raises a MatchError on execution. A compile error seems preferable to a guaranteed runtime exception. I guess this changed with changeset r23726 and Parsers.caseSeparated().
