I'm now using 2.7.6.final and this problem is occurring again. May be due to SI-1349, which I'm also seeing (I have JUnit 4.5 in my Build Path and am using the JUnit 4 test runner.) 

This was from an old project that had JUnit 3 based tests that
I was able to run. Then today I converted to JUnit 4 using @Test instead
of extends TestCase and the tests worked with annotations... for a while.
After a few edit/save/test cycles, however, the tests stopped running
and Eclipse reported the same error dialog from the JUnit view
when I clicked on the JUnit run button

   No tests found with test runner 'JUnit 4'

As with SI-1349, I cannot invoke Run as... JUnit test from the Package Explorer view.

I did a Project -> clean and the problem persists. The tests compile
file, I just cannot run them using only the annotations.
When I switch back to extends TestCase the runner can find/execute them
without fail.
