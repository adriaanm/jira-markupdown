It is, but that's scala's bug, not theirs. The author of that method wrote it in in a perfectly obvious way, which has worked forever; it's probably the explicitly recommended way in one or more official scala things. They only ever call the method with Lists, not Vectors, which they've never heard of. It will never fail - until it is broken out from under them to fix a bug not of their making and which they could never have anticipated.
