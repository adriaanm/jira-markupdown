In order to disambiguate getters and underlying fields we mangle the latter by appending LOCAL_SUFFIX_STRING (a single whitespace) to their names. That worked fine before we exposed it to the entire world by introducing macros and runtime reflection. Now it's utterly confusing.
So they will both be members, with the same name? If I "foo member bar" I get an overloaded symbol with both the field and the getter? I do not think that will end well; at the least it will require changing a ton of code to consider alternatives or add a suchThat in order to filter out the field.
{code}
scala> res0.info.member("field": TermName)
res5: $r.intp.global.Symbol = method field

scala> res0.info.member("field ": TermName)
res6: $r.intp.global.Symbol = variable field
{code}
