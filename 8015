I am not entirely sure this is a bug.  Such an override guarantees that equality is asymmetric as `null==(new X)` cannot possibly be anything but false.

If you want weird non-equality-like behavior in your relation, I do not think it is too much to ask to not call it `==` and therefore retain this warning.
