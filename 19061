```scala
object ScalaTest extends App {
  trait A {
    def a: String
    println(a)
  }
  class B extends A {
    override val a = "Overridden"
  }
  new B // prints "null"
}
```
This only happens when `def` or `val` is overridden with `val`.
This happens even if `a` is not abstract and has an implementation in `A` - both original and overridden values of `a` are ignored and `null` is printed instead.

In my understanding this should work or at least cause some kind of compilation warning/error.
