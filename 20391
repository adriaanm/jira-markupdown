The following code:
```scala
val a = 100; ({ val a = 0; (c: Int) => c })(a)
```

Evaluates to 0.
This is because it is transformed by the typer to:
```scala
val a: Int = 100; { val a: Int = 0; ((c: Int) => c).apply(a) }
```

The problem does not appear if one uses 'apply', as in:
```scala
val a = 100; { val a = 0; (c: Int) => c } apply a
```
