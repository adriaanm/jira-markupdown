this is as specified. the parameterless version

{code}
3 + 3�
{code}

is a postfix operation (according to the spec), it is parsed as
{code}
InfixExpr(3+3) id(�)
{code}

when you add the empty parameter list, the `�` becomes an infix operator, so in the expression
{code}
3 + 3 � ()
{code}
we have two infix operators, `+` and `�`. now, the operator precedence comes into play, and `+` has lower precedence.
