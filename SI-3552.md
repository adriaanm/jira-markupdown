Step 1: Download scala-2.7.7.final.zip.

Step 2: Unzip to root of D:\ drive.

Step 3: Rename directory to Scala.

Step 4: Add D:\Scala\bin to PATH environment variable.

Step 5: Log off of Windows.

Step 6: Log back on to Windows.

Step 7: Open a DOS window.

Step 8: Enter "scala" at the command prompt.

Step 9: Note the error message:
{code}
\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe was unexpected at this time.
{code}


Step 10: Enter "scala.bat" at the command prompt.

Step 11: Note the same error message.

Step 12: Remove "@echo off" from scala.bat.

Step 13: Rerun scala.bat.

Step 14: Note the failing script line, with variables expanded: 
{code}
if exist "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" set _JAVACMD=C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe
{code}

Step 15: Change scala.bat line 31 to use quotes around the bit after "set": 
{code}
if exist "%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe" set "_JAVACMD=%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe"
{code}

Step 16: Restore "@echo off" at the top of the script.

Step 17: Enter "scala" at the command line again.

Step 18: Note with pleasure that the script works now.
