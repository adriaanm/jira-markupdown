You can't try enteringPhase with phases that aren't in the current run.

The current crash is at Global#Run#resetPackageClass, which has the comment, "Reset package class to state at typer (not sure what this is needed for?)."

A similar bug was fixed at

https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/541a6692c2b4124491fa43fe3a1455c9cf7d7042

But I think even that fix assumes there are no phases between parser and namer, which ain't necessarily so.  stopPhase means the stop-before is exactly that phase, but you could -Ystop-before:my-post-parser so that there is no namer.

So the useful idiom might be something like, enteringPhaseOrError or enteringPhaseMaybe, depending on whether it's OK to omit the work unit in this run.  Rather than assert and crash.

```scala
apm@mara:~/tmp$ scalac -Ydebug -Ystop-after:namer trivial.scala 
[running phase parser on trivial.scala]
[running phase namer on trivial.scala]
error: 
     while compiling: trivial.scala
        during phase: global=terminal, atPhase=namer
     library version: version 2.10.1
    compiler version: version 2.10.1
  reconstructed args: -Ydebug -deprecation -feature -Ystop-after:namer
```



Given phase assembly

```scala
apm@mara:~/tmp$ scalac -Ydebug -Xplugin:../projects/deprecator/checker.jar -Xshow-phases -Xgenerate-phase-graph phase-bug
             phase name  id  description
             ----------  --  -----------
                 parser   1  parse source into ASTs, perform simple desugaring
       elide-deprecated   2  
                  namer   3  resolve names, attach symbols to named trees
         packageobjects   4  load package objects
                  typer   5  the meat and potatoes: type the trees
       check-deprecated   6  
                 patmat   7  translate match expressions
         superaccessors   8  add super accessors in traits and nested classes
```

then stop-after:parser fails

```scala
apm@mara:~/tmp$ scalac -Ydebug -Xplugin:../projects/deprecator/checker.jar -Ystop-after:parser trivial.scala [running phase parser on trivial.scala]
error: uncaught exception during compilation: java.lang.AssertionError
error: java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: <no phase>

```
