This issue is essentially a duplicate of SI-1667. A simple workaround is splitting the long expression into smaller ones; even for automatically generated source code that can be easily accomplished. Alternatively, just increase your stack size: the example provided compiles if you add "-Xss1M" to JAVA_OPTS.

Either way, this ticket can be seen more like a request for improvement rather than a bug: the concrete usability of the compiler is not impacted significantly by the fact that a single expression with 100 subexpressions requires a slightly larger stack to typecheck.

Closing it as a duplicate of SI-1667.
