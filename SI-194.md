This implicit removes too much type safety, and can lead to confusing results.

I think this is more important than the '+' operator being symmetric.


_UPDATE 2015-07-29_:
*Workaround*: You can opt-out on a per-file basis by unimporting it.
{code}
import Predef.{any2stringadd => _,_}
object foo extends App{
  println(new java.util.Date + " sfsdf") // error: value + is not a member of java.util.Date
}
{code}
Having continuity with Java is great, but not at the price of compromising type safety.
A good example is the use of null vs Option[A].
As a programmer get situated in Scala comfortably, he or she no longer thinks in terms of Java or other languages,
and a normal Scala would almost never use null actively (with a few exception in standard lib such as regex extraction and XML namespace).
In my opinion, having a source-level compatibility of `+` with Java doesn't buy much, and is very harmful to Scala as a language. More than once I've been bitten by unintended "Some(...)" or "None" showing up in string output.
An ideal course of action would be to deprecate any2stringadd so the compiler would start raising warnings, if not an optional compiler error would be helpful like `-no-unsafeadd`.

Now that Scala has string interpolation, there is less need to build strings with {{+}}. So perhaps this decision could be revisited.
I think it's worth pointing out that this behavior is not common in many mainstream languages.

Here's Python:
{code}
>>> "" + 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
{code}

Here's Ruby:
{code}
irb(main):001:0> "" + 2
TypeError: can't convert Fixnum into String
	from (irb):1:in `+'
	from (irb):1
	from /usr/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
{code}

And in languages where it is, it's given as a bad example. I think Java folks can learn to appreciate a lack of implicit conversion to string, especially given that they don't need it with string interpolation.

I hope it's clear to everyone that the issue isn't just a theoretical one about rigor, that matters only if you have your head in the clouds. This is something that bites all Scala coders trying to write correct code, but that includes biting beginners all the time, when they are learning the language. So for example just now on IRC:

{noformat}
D: to append to a collection use :+ not +
I: ah, thanks!
I: I was following red herrings it seems
B: huh
B: required: String
I: yeah, that was what my reaction was too B. When I started looking at the documentation
  I figured the addString methods might be related, and the byte was getting converted to a Char implicitly,
  and then wanted to treat the whole thing as a String. But apparently it's something else entirely
B: ! Vector(new Foo, new Foo) + (new Foo)
multibot_:  error: type mismatch;
multibot_:   found  : Foo
multibot_:   required: String
B: not even "oh hey I think you might have meant String here", it's "REQUIRED String", wtf
{noformat}

This is just one example; I've seen versions of this exchange on #scala countless times over the years.

It gets especially confusing if someone points out or realizes that Set actually does expect + and not :+ or +: .
@Seth - Martin's comment was not about a replacement for any2stringadd, but about a source-code rewriting tool. His comments in that thread about removing it are basically "we will break too much code."

@Adriaan - nice idea, what would be arguments against it?

@Seth - Sure. Just wanted to clarify that, apparently my clarification wasn't too clear. :)

It's worth mentioning that the workaround only works when the import is done at the top level, which is not always possible (ie: in macro implementations). What I do is shadow the definition of `Predef.any2stringadd` by declaring a new one locally:
{code:scala}
def any2stringadd = ???
{code}

{code}
scala> case class C(c: String = "hi")
defined class C

scala> { def any2stringadd = ??? ; C() + "EOS" }
<console>:13: error: value + is not a member of C
       { def any2stringadd = ??? ; C() + "EOS" }
                                       ^

scala> { def any2stringadd = ??? ; (C(): any2stringadd[C]) + "EOS" }
res1: String = C(hi)EOS

scala> { def any2stringadd = ??? ; type any2stringadd[_] = Nothing ; (C(): any2stringadd[C]) + "EOS" }
<console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 found   : C
 required: any2stringadd[C]
    (which expands to)  Nothing
       { def any2stringadd = ??? ; type any2stringadd[_] = Nothing ; (C(): any2stringadd[C]) + "EOS" }
                                                                       ^
<console>:13: error: value + is not a member of any2stringadd[C]
       { def any2stringadd = ??? ; type any2stringadd[_] = Nothing ; (C(): any2stringadd[C]) + "EOS" }
                                                                                             ^
{code}
Another option is to make the implicit ambiguous, can do that just once for your project by putting it in a top-level package object:

{code:scala}
package object io.atlassian {
  def undefined[A]: A = sys.error("undefined")

  // any2stringadd allows anything to be added against String.
  class AmbiguousStringAdd {
    def +(b: String) = undefined
  }

  implicit def amb1any2stringadd(a: Any) = new AmbiguousStringAdd 
  implicit def amb2any2stringadd(a: Any) = new AmbiguousStringAdd
}
{code}

I also wrote a patch for SI-6806, which allows the above to have a nice error message:

I'll submit a PR to scala/scala
