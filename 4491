If this is indeed related to scala/bug#2910, when that ticket is fixed, the code in this ticket will become a compile error instead of a crasher.  There is nothing illegal about the code, though, right?  I don't see any forward references, so I think it should compile and this ticket is a separate issue.

A slightly simpler case:
```scala
class N {
  locally {
    lazy val ms = "as"
    ms
  }
}
```
