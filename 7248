Is it possible to change the class name of Ctrie to something more in line with the style guide out there?
Having "ConcurrentHashMap" in Java I think "ConcurrentTrie" is a reasonable choice. Imho it is very dangerous to _not_ follow the standard naming without a very good reason, because it serves as precedent and excuse for users to ignore naming conventions in their own code.

Scala Style guide:

bq. Classes should be named in the camelCase style with the very first letter of the name capitalized [...] This mimics the Java naming convention for classes.

Java naming conventions:

bq. Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).
