The examples work now.

The triple plus is not invalid:
```scala
scala> val + = 12
+: Int = 12

scala> + + +
<console>:9: error: ambiguous reference to overloaded definition,
both method + in class Int of type (x: Char)Int
and  method + in class Int of type (x: Byte)Int
match expected type ?
              + + +
                  ^

scala> val f: Int => Int = + + +
warning: there was one feature warning; re-run with -feature for details
f: Int => Int = <function1>
```
The rule is that it takes the first plus in the traditional way if it can.
