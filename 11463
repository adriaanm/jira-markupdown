My hunch is that this is a file permissions problem somewhere, but I can't see where that might be.

A similar symptom was reported here: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/30550

I suspect that the error reporting in the JDK is poor when it comes to problems like this on the boot classpath.

To troubleshoot this theory, you could run the `java ....` command under strace to trace the system calls.

Here's what I see doing that (using dtruss on Mac): https://gist.github.com/retronym/0542fc2f4c70c39843d8
