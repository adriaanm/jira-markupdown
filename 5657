(In r24483) Always forget that checking system properties causes exceptions
in applets and such.  Made the system property wrapper wrap its
access checks in some more wrapping.  I spent a long time trying to
write a test for the security manager but it's hopeless without knowing
all the details of the test environment.  Closes scala/bug#4346, no review.
