trait Foo{
  type I[_];
  def doStuff[T](xs : I[T]);
}

class Bar extends Foo{
  type I[_] = Array[_];
  def doStuff[T](arr : Array[T]) = arr.foreach(println(_));
}

Results in  

error: class Bar needs to be abstract, since method doStuff in trait Foo of type [T](Bar.this.I[T])Unit is not defined

However if we replace this with

trait Foo{
  type I;
  def doStuff(xs : I);
}

class Bar extends Foo{
  type I = Array[String];
  def doStuff(arr : Array[String]) = arr.foreach(println(_));
}

It works fine.
The problem lies with your


{code}
  type I[_] = Array[_]
{code}

That should be:
{code}
  type I[X] = Array[X]
{code}

I'll look into how we can make the error clearer (I think the former yields an existential on the RHS, which is why the types don't match).
