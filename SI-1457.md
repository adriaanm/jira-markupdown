It does it in the basic cases, but there are a lot of cases where it fails very badly. See the horrible nested if statements generated for Scanners.scala as an example.

This is an umbrella ticket which I'll use to collate information about other tickets related to the failure of scalac to emit switch statements in obvious places and general problems and strategies for solving them.

The most important thing right now is figuring out a way to test these cases reliably. It's no good fixing them if they're just going to break again and we can't detect that. 

I will close this ticket when a test mechanism is in place and all known bugs relating to the failure to emit switch statements are closed with a passing test. 

Currently related tickets: #1456, #1452
Also related: #1458.
Consolidated under #2398.
