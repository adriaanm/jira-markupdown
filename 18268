{{scala.util.Properties.isMac}} returns incorrect values because it checks for the {{java.vendor}} property. This stopped working pretty much since Oracle ships its own version of Java for Mac (and one can compile OpenJDK for it).

Obviously and according to a TechNote, {{os.name}} should be used to detect a Mac OSX operating system.
