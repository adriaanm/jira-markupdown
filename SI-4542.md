=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
```scala
scala> @deprecated("foooo") class Foo()
defined class Foo

scala> val f = new Foo
<console>:8: warning: class Foo in object $$iw is deprecated: foooo
       val f = new Foo
           ^
<console>:8: warning: class Foo in object $$iw is deprecated: foooo
       val f = new Foo
                   ^
<console>:6: warning: class Foo in object $$iw is deprecated: foooo
lazy val $$result = {
         ^
f: Foo = Foo@76d88aa2
```



=== What is the expected behavior? ===
`lazy val $$result` should not appear.


=== What do you see instead? ===
`lazy val $$result` appears.


=== Additional information ===
It clutters the output, because it shows things the use has no control over.

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.10.0.r24736-b20110412020139
(In r24892) Be silent when compiling the repl extraction object to suppress
spurious warnings.  Also corrected the busted logic for spotting
repl wrappers.  Closes #4542, no review.
