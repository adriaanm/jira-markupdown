Replying to [comment:2 milessabin]:
> Path and path element limits on Linux are filesystem dependent. To the best of my knowledge ext3 and ext4 have a 255 byte limit for path _elements_, but there is no overall limit for path length.

On Windows, the situation is worse: Though NTFS is able to handle file names up to 255 chars, the Windows API commonly uses a maximum _path length_ of 260 chars. There are ways get around that limit, but even Windows 7 Explorer displays error messages when trying to delete, rename or copy files with very long file names, and so do many other Windows programs.

It would help us very much to have an option in the Scala compiler to generate short file names (i.e. < 40 chars) only.
