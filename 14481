When passing a value as an Option, you must manually wrap it as a Some:
```scala
def f(x: Option[Int]) = . . .
f(Some(3))
f(None)
```
Conceptually, you should be able to pass in some value, or None.  This is possible with a simple implicit conversion:
```scala
implicit def wrapSome[A](x: A) = Some(x)

f(3)
f(None)
```
