I think Adriaan's response did not answer the issue and does not warrant the closing of this issue.

While it is true that {code}(new C)[Int][String]{code} is valid Scala, the statement is a value expression (see Chapter 6 Expressions) and has nothing to do with this issue, which is about SimpleType (Chapter 3, Types).

For those who are not versed in reading BNF, the issue here is the rule 
{code}SimpleType ::= SimpleType TypeArgs{code}
which, by recursive application, expands to
{code}SimpleType ::= SimpleType TypeArgs TypeArgs{code}
This rule should be rewriten so that the recursion is not possible. To make it clear, the bug is primarily in the BNF. I don't know how the parser/compiler is implemented.

As for Adriaans example, it is a SimpleExpr1, which expands as follows using the rules of Chapter 6:
{code}
SimpleExpr1 
=> SimpleExpr TypeArgs
=> SimpleExpr1 TypeArgs
=> SimpleExpr TypeArgs TypeArgs
=> etc, etc
=> ‘(’ 'new' ClassTemplate ‘)’ TypeArgs TypeArgs
=> (new C)[Int][String]
{code}

I.e. the example is not relevant to this case as it does not employ the SimpleType rules for the TypeArgs.
