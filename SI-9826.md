A REPL needs a better story for implicit application than `-Xprint:typer`.

There's coloring and underlining.

Another idea is an explanatory comment on the input line:

{code}
scala> q + 1         // scala.this.Predef.any2stringadd[scala.collection.immutable.Queue[Int]]($line11.$read.q).+(1)
{code}

Shorter type names would help that solution.
