The new optimizer explains in more detail ( {{-Ydebug -neo:o3 -Ylog:jvm -Yinline-warnings}} ) why that inlining is unfeasible.

Summary: because of the local method in {{List.dropWhile}} , which becomes private to {{immutable.List}}

Snippet:

{noformat}
class C {
  def m() {
    List(0).dropWhile(_ < 1)
  }
}
{noformat}

Where does that private method come from? From the {{@tailrec}}-optimized {{loop()}}:

{noformat}
  @inline final override def dropWhile(p: A => Boolean): List[A] = {
    @tailrec
    def loop(xs: List[A]): List[A] =
      if (xs.isEmpty || !p(xs.head)) xs
      else loop(xs.tail)

    loop(this)
  }
{noformat}


It's not a bug of the old optimizer.


This makes the combination of {{-optimize}} and {{-Xfatal-warnings}} pretty much unusable, since even if you don't explicitly pass {{-Yinline-warnings}}, the "re-run with -Yinline-warnings for details" warning itself is fatal.

I believe almost any well-managed project should be using {{-Xfatal-warnings}}, so this means I can't use the 2.11 optimizer on any of my projects.

SI-8410 is very similar, but for {{-deprecation}} instead of {{-Yinline-warnings}}. Jason Zaugg's comment is "For now, I'd suggest to run without fatal warnings and post-process the compiler output in a build tool."
