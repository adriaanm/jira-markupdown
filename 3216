More specifically, adding "val a = new" as a new field of class A.

Also, SI-2633 mentions positions are expected to be bad on bad input, so perhaps this is just fine and expected. I admit the only side effect seems to be an entry in the Error log.

But I thought I'd file a bug just to be sure that getting this error doesn't somehow start the ball rolling that would cause other errors/bugs later on while editing.
