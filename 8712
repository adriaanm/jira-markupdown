As far as I see, there is only one alternative usage: People who used the remove method to say "remove all elements starting from this index", e. g. index valid, count too large:
```scala
val lb = collection.mutable.ListBuffer('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e)

lb remove (4, Int.MaxValue) // "Remove all items starting from index 4"
```

I would probably just rule out this usage (I checked ArrayBuffer and UnrolledBuffer and both don't have this behvaiour, too) and – only if people actually complain – add a special method for this use case similar to trimStart/trimEnd (maybe trimFrom?).
