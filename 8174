simplified to 

{code}
class A[T]
object A {
  def y(backing: Map[A[_], Any]): Iterable[A[_]] =
    backing.map{case (k: A[kt], v) => (k: A[kt])}
}
{code}

would it be enough to know `(k: A[_])`? before, this only type checked because we let wildcard types sneak past so it was effectively only checking `(k: A[_])`
