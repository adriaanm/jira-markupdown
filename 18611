scala.sys.process.Process doesn't understand quoting of any kind.

For example:
```scala
import scala.sys.process._
"""java -classpath "/some folder/"  Main.main""".!
```
will invoke java with 4 arguments:
 - {code}-classpath{code}
 - {code}"/some{code}
 - {code}folder/"{code}
 - {code}Main.main{code}

This will obviously fail.

Also:
```scala
// this will succeed:
"""java -classpath /tmp/  Main.main""".!
// but this will fail:
"""java -classpath "/tmp/"  Main.main""".!
// because java receives "/tmp/" including quotes
// as classpath
```

All usual shells (bash & co., cmd, cygwin, powershell) properly strip the quotes before giving them to the application.
