Deserialization of scala.collection.immutable.HashMap.HashMap1 leave the 'kv' field empty, which causes NullPointerException when 'merged' is executed on this Map (and maybe also in other cases).
My understanding is that HashMap1 objects with null 'kv' field are ill-formed and this is a bug.
I've created a pull request that fixes this issue. (Shouldn't it automagically get linked to this ticket?)
