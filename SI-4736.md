I hereby propose to enhance the member filter of the Scaladoc pages.

Attached is a patch with the following changes relative to trunk:

* The member filter section moved from the page itself to a bar at the top. The elements changed, but all functionality is still there.
* I improved the text based member filter. The text input field is automatically focused once you start typing, regardless of whether it had the focus or not. Also, whenever filtering, the top of the member section is scrolled into view.
* Text filtering is not using regular expression syntax anymore. This means you can actually type "\+\+" to search for members called "\+\+". Before, you needed to type escape the plus characters with backslashes to achieve this.
* Whitespace in the text filter is used to OR search terms. Typing "fold reduce" shows all members containing either "fold" or "reduce".
* Filtering should be (way) faster than before. This is mostly noticeable when using the text based filter on a large page, like collection.Seq. On my system it is more than 3 times faster.
* I removed some redundancy in the static html (removed "shortcomment" divs). This is noticeable by the somewhat cleaner/smoother animation when opening/closing members. Also, file size is somewhat smaller. This change necessitated some changes of the Scaladoc tests (3 total). All of partest still passes with these changes.
* Now, the first line of the comment is shown when a member is closed, regardless of the comments content. Before, it showed the first sentence, regardless of the sentences length. This usually means that it shows more of the comment than before (depending on window width).
* I did some smaller tweaks to the CSS. For example, attributes and parameter descriptions are now aligned.

I uploaded some selected pages with the modifications from the attached patch:
