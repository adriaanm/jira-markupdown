[The 2.12.1 Scaladoc page for Either](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/util/Either.html) includes the following example:

{code}Left(23).map(_ * 2)  // Left(23){code}

But this example does not compile:

```scala
$ scala
Welcome to Scala 2.12.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.8.0_102).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> Left(23).map(_ * 2)
<console>:12: error: value * is not a member of Nothing
       Left(23).map(_ * 2)
```
Improves several similar snippets.

It's also not pastable.  #9016
