When running the REPL, ctrl+v has stopped working in 2.11.1 (used to work in 2.10.3); could be a regression in JLine, or a problem in the way it is used by the scala REPL.
(Other ctrl such as ctrl+e, ctrl+k, ctrl+l are still working.)

If this gets fixed upstream, we'll happily upgrade to the latest jline in the next 2.11.x release, as tracked here: SI-8595
