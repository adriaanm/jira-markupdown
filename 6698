OK.  I did run ant nightly and confirmed the error.  Then evening came and morning came, the second day.  I can see why -optimise is not the default test mode.  I had to run out and pick up my daughter from pre-K, and now I'm taking her to see Olivier's Henry V.  I ought to have run ant nightly before going to the cinema. Yes, I'll find something to fix that I can almost understand. Once more into the breach.
