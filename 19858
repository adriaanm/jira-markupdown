The Eclipse configuration files have apparently gone stale. It looks like the `asm` project is now empty and replaced with a JAR in `/build/deps/asm/`. Some inter-project dependencies are off:
- `repl` needs `interactive`
* {{scaladoc}} doesn't need {{partest-extras}} (otherwise creates a cycle with {{interactive}}, {{repl}})
- `test-junit` needs `partest-extras`, `scaladoc`, and the `scala-xml` JAR
