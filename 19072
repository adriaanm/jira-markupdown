As shown in [https://gist.github.com/ijuma/11222642], the fix to [SI-8157](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8157) introduced a source-incompatible progression. This should be put under a source flag to allow the previous version to run under `-Xsource:2.10`.

Thanks Adriaan for the [heads up](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3380#issuecomment-41192184).
