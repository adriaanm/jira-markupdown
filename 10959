There was a very similar issue with quasiquotes. 

The quick solution for this is to change f interpolator signature from current:
{code}
def f(args: Any*): String = macro ???
{code}
to:
{code}
def f[T](args: T*): String = macro ???
{code}
It will force typer not to be lazy and properly infer specific types to arguments of the interpolator. At least this is how quasiquotes implementation works around this issue.
