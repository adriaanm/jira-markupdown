There isn't any way to rescue it with a `ClassTag`, I agree.

The only idea I have is to embrace the notion that `ArraySeq` can tell which elements have been initialized, and that it will traverse only those.  You can do this by filling the array with a sentinel element that can't otherwise be accessed.  foreaching over a bunch of `null` elements isn't so spiffy for regular classes either.

If we do this, then all becomes (somewhat) sane again.  Otherwise, I recommend we just deprecate it.  It's not *that* useful compared to `ArrayBuffer`.
