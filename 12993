Using scala 2.6.1 final there is a problem with sequence patterns with wild cards.

When the prefix is one element, I get the following

{code}
scala> List(1,2,3,4) match { case Seq(_, rest@_*) => rest }
res4: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
{code}

I was expecting `List(2,3,4)`

When the prefix is more than one element, I get the expected results

{code}
scala> List(1,2,3,4) match { case Seq(_,_,rest@_*) => rest }
res5: Seq[Int] = List(3, 4)
{code}
