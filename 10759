Well, *that* I hadn't considered. So if I understand correctly, this should not compile at all, but rather emit an error saying that `GenTraversableOnce[_]` cannot conform to `Test.Structural` because it is not provably a reference type, whereas the lint rule you mention would only act as a safety net for similarly incorrectly-handled edge cases?
