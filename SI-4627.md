There a classes like scala.swing.test.UIDemo or scala.util.parsing.combinator.testing.RegexTest which look like example source code having no further use case.

E. g. run "scala scala.swing.test.UIDemo".

I'm not sure those two are the only ones.

I don't think this should be shipped with the standard library. Is it possible to move this code either to the website or have some special separate "example" jar?
Simon, it looks like your pull request did not make it in. Could you please have a look? Thanks!
