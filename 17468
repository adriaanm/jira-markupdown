In `scala/package.scala` we see:
```scala
type Fractional[T] = scala.math.Fractional[T]
type Integral[T] = scala.math.Integral[T]

type Numeric[T] = scala.math.Numeric[T]
val Numeric = scala.math.Numeric
```
But `Fractional` and `Integral` have an associated object as well, and they should be aliased as well for consistency.

I'm preparing a pull request for this to check for any unintended effects.
