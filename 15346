Trying to minimize SI-3431 I thought I was learning interesting stuff until I realized what I was really isolating was this:
{code}
warnNoInline(
  if (inc.code eq null) "bytecode was unavailable"
  else if (!isSafeToInline(m, inc, info.stack)) "it is unsafe (target may reference private fields)"
  else "a bug (run with -Ylog:inline -Ydebug for more information)"
)
{code}
The call to isSafeToInline crashes the compiler if there are any open blocks.  Here is source which crashes under -optimise, but with that isSafeToInline call commented out, does not:
{code}
object A {    
  def f1(f: String => Boolean) = f("a")

  def f2(): Boolean =
    f1 { s1 =>
      f1 { s2 =>
        while (true) { }
        true
      }
    }
}
{code}
