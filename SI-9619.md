Given this code, where {{|}} denotes position of the cursor where we request to jump to definition of item in that position:

{code:scala}
case class Foo(a: Int, b: Int)

object Foo {
  // Jump correctly to Foo
  def get1 = Foo(
    |a = 1,
    b = 2
  )

  // Jump incorrectly to get2 method definition
  def get2 = Foo(
    |b = 2,
    a = 1
  )
}
{code}

When asked for type in {{get1}} method, presentation compiler is returning {{scala.reflect.internal.Trees.Apply}}, which will take us to {{case class Foo}} definition as expected.
When asked for type in {{get2}} method, presentation compiler is returning {{scala.reflect.internal.Trees.DefDef}}, which will take us to method {{def2}} definition.

Expected bahaviour is in both cases to jump to {{case class Foo}} definition.

This is causing inconsistent behaviour in scala-ide and ensime.
