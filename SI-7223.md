Compiler crashes on my project, with "no-symbol does not have an owner". Happens both in IDE and SBT. 2.10.0-RC2 is fine, 2.10.1-RC2 is not. I have attached the "last" output from SBT. This was previously discussed in https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6921, but I was asked to open a new issue, so here it is...

I managed to boil it down to a few lines. The below crashes the compiler for me in the newest edition of the IDE, which I believe is using 2.10.1-RC2. Highly likely it also crashes in SBT. The last reduction before I extracted it from my project entirely did so, under 2.10.1-RC1. Where there are nulls, there was previously other code that I removed during the reduction, so the nulls aren't it. I also changed the names of all classes and most variables to protect the innocent.

Please let me know if this works for you!

{code}
package scala.crash

class A {
  class A1 {
    case class A11(i: Int, j: Int) {
      lazy val a11: Option[C] = null
    }
    
    class A12(f: (Int, Int)=>A11) extends
      D((i, j, id, rep) => {
        for (x <- Some(f(i, j)); s<-x.a11) yield new B.B1(x.i, x.j) {}
      })
  }
}

object B {
  class B1(val row: Int, val col: Int) 
    extends C 
  {
     val b1: C = null
  }
}

trait C {
}

class D[T](t: (Int, Int, Int, Int)=>Option[T]) {
}
{code}




Not sure if this helps, but what I ended out doing in my code is define a method in class A1 to compute the anonymous function passed in the constructor to D, like so:

{code}
class A1 {
  ...
  def ff(f: (Int, Int)=>A11): (Int, Int, Int, Int)=>Option[B.B1] =
    (i, j, id, rep) => {
      for (x <- Some(f(i, j)); s<-x.a11) yield new B.B1(x.i, x.j) {}
    }
  class A12(f: (Int, Int)=>A11) extends D(ff(f))
}
{code}

That averted the crash.

Regressed in SI-6666 / fd6125428af90b02cb8969a53586f3551e275b0f.

A workaround is to structure the code as follows:

{code}
package scala.crash

class A {
  class A1 {
    case class A11(i: Int, j: Int) {
      lazy val a11: Option[C] = null
    }

    class A12(f: (Int, Int)=>A11) extends
      D(toF4(f))

    def toF4(f: (Int, Int)=>A11) = (i: Int, j: Int, id: Int, rep: Int) => {
      for (x <- Some(f(i, j)); s<-x.a11) yield new B.B1(x.i, x.j) {}
    }
  }
}

object B {
  class B1(val row: Int, val col: Int)
    extends C
  {
     val b1: C = null
  }
}

trait C {
}

class D[T](t: (Int, Int, Int, Int)=>Option[T]) {
}
{code}
Minimized:

{code}
package scala.crash

object Crash extends D(() => {
  (x: Int) => {() => { new { x.toString } }}
})

class D(a: Any)
{code}
