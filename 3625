Paul, before reading your comment, I added a comment to scala/bug#2133, where I also complained (for the same reasons you give above about failure of encapsulation), and reopened that bug:
https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-2133?focusedCommentId=56541#comment-56541
The reasons you give above seem more valid, so maybe you should close the bug again. Sorry for the noise!
