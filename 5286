I don't doubt you didn't make it up, but I couldn't tell what you were doing which would bring it about.

The field will come to be if a conversion from T => Serializable is required outside of the primary constructor.  For example, add this method and you'll see the field, because it can't "forget" how it is that Ts becomes Serializables.
{code}
  def obj_s: Serializable = obj
{code}
If I don't find a reason I shouldn't or can't, I'll make <:< (or you've known it, "scala.Predef$$$$anon3") and =:= serializable.
