=== What steps will reproduce the problem? ===
One example is object Char, [http://www.scala-lang.org/archives/downloads/distrib/files/nightly/docs/library/scala/Char$$.html].

=== What is the expected behavior? ===
{code}
  val MaxValue : Char('\uffff')
  val MinValue : Char('\00') 
{code}

=== What do you see instead? ===
{code}
  val MaxValue : Char(\'\uffff\')
  val MinValue : Char(\'\00\') 
{code}

I spent some time looking into this, but I couldn't figure out where the char literal printing is done. I think it might actually be using some code outside of Scaladoc itself, but it is not obvious where this is.

Seems like fix for SI-4792 fixed this issue too:

Simon, are you fine with closing this ticket?
