I really, really like the new tabcompletion in REPL except from how it works with method arguments. Example:

If I type Math.<tab> I get a wonderful list of all the methods I can call including the "max" method. GREAT!

If I type Math.max(<tab> I would expect a list of all the arguments that can be provided (incl. types since it is a java method) but instead I get this response which is not useful at all : "apple      ch         com        java       javax      jline      org
scala      settings   sun        sunw"

Can this be fixed so tab completion of method arguments are more useful (e.g. work like code completion in the java IDE's ?)
