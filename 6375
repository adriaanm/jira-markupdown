Adding a manifest Class-Path to the plugin.jar works in the usual way.  

It seems to me that the reason to have an option for a plugin class path is that two plugins have conflicting dependencies and you have to keep them separate; otherwise, using the compiler's class path suffices.

If a plugin-specific path is deemed a requirement, maybe make -Xplugin a path instead of a location.  One of the elements of the path better contain a plugin descriptor.  The first lucky location to define a plugin wins.  That path is used to load it, of course.

E.g., `-Xplugin:plugin1.jar:dep1.jar,plugin2.jar:dep2.jar,something.jar:plugin3.jar`
