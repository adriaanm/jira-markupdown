Yeah, I meant enumeration. I agree that it sounds like it comes from javac but this error *does not* appear if I don't create an instance of this class in scala. This java class is used in the java part of the app and generates no error. I ended up getting around the need for instantiating this class. If it appears again, I'll try to narrow it down. Thx
