This seems like an easy fix. (My code doesn't matter so much, I imagine the trick is just to make class ArrowAssoc in Predef final.)

/Users/dlwh/src/scalanlp/core/src/main/scala/scalanlp/classify/LinearClassifier.scala:84: warning: Could not inline required method -> because it is not final.
      Example(false, Map(1->x,2->y));

That's what the last guy thought, I imagine... right before some snake bit off his head.
```scala
git shortlog head -2
cunei (1):
      Reverting r20406 (dragos)

dragos (1):
      Added final modifiers to several classes used by Predef implicits.

For the record it looks like this fixes a problem building the continuations plugin with 2.8.0.Beta1-RC7 (soon to be an official beta). With that version I get:

```scala
   [scalac] doc/examples/continuations/JoinPatterns.scala:103: warning: Could not inline required method -> because it is not final.
   [scalac]                 items += (c.asInstanceOf[Channel[_,_]] -> MatchData(c.values(0)))
   [scalac]                                                            ^
   [scalac] doc/examples/continuations/Test9Monads.scala:42: warning: Could not inline required method -> because it is not final.
   [scalac]       List(left.reflect[Any] -> right.reflect[Any])
   [scalac]                              ^
```

With 2.8.0.r20558-b20100118020155 these warnings are gone.
