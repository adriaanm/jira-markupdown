This kept me up a little late last night. Given a file with a bad character near the end, this script just prints a character (either a newline or space) forever.
```scala
import scala.io.Source;
val iter = Source.fromFile("/path/to/this/attachment");
while(iter.hasNext) print(iter.next);
```

Obviously, I should say "latin1" for a file like this, but it would be nice if I got some kind of error. At least an EOF.

Thanks!
