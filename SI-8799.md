Consider the following program:
```scala
object TestA {
  @inline final val x = 8
}
object TestB {
  def m {
    println(TestA.x)
  }
}
```
Inspecting with `scalac -print` we get what we would expect:
```
package <empty> {
  object TestA extends Object {
    final <stable> <accessor> def x(): Int(8) = 8;
    def <init>(): TestA.type = {
      TestA.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  };
  object TestB extends Object {
    def m(): Unit = scala.this.Predef.println(scala.Int.box(8));
    def <init>(): TestB.type = {
      TestB.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```


However, explicitly stating the type on Int causes the inliner to fail (which is, quite surprisingly, correct behavior according to the spec [1]). The problem is that no warning is given, and users of the language would reasonably expect the inlining of the constant to continue to happen. Consider the modified example:
```scala
object TestA {
  @inline final val x: Int = 8   // Only this line has changed!
}
object TestB {
  def m {
    println(TestA.x)
  }
}
```
Inspecting with `scalac -print`, or your favorite bytecode disassembler (I've tried `javap` too), we see the problem:
```
package <empty> {
  object TestA extends Object {
    @inline final private[this] val x: Int = _;
    final <stable> <accessor> def x(): Int = TestA.this.x;
    def <init>(): TestA.type = {
      TestA.super.<init>();
      TestA.this.x = 8;
      ()
    }
  };
  object TestB extends Object {
    def m(): Unit = scala.this.Predef.println(scala.Int.box(TestA.x()));
    def <init>(): TestB.type = {
      TestB.super.<init>();
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

When tracing the inliner with the `-Ylog-inliner` option, in the second example that exhibits the bug, there is not even a mention of `TestA.x()`, not even that the inliner tried and gave up!

I remembered a discussion somewhere saying this was intentional/not-a-bug (maybe https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-language/PW8YMO2Rakc/fsa_YwTHaQMJ), and this led me to #7542...
Okay, I've found it in the spec now. Many thanks for that, but I couldn't find it before.

But, I have to say, I think the requirement in the spec that no type is given (although the type still must be inferred), is nothing less than crazy. Making the inferred type explicit simply shouldn't change the code generation like that, and the fact that the inliner gave no warnings is also disappointing. Even if the intention is that the @inline annotation does nothing in that position, the log should at least *say something* to that effect.

How would an "average" user the of the language (if such a person exists), when making seemingly safe changes to the code by adding an explicit type (perhaps for the sake of documentation, if, say, the type annotation is a synonym introduced by the {{type}} keyword), know that the expression is no longer considered a "constant expression" for the purposes of code generation or inlining, especially when no warnings are given by -Yinline-warnings and the @inline annotation has been applied?

My current solution in such situations is to inspect the bytecode generated after each compilation, since this is the only way I know for sure that the compiler is doing *what I think* it *should* be doing. But, I rarely have to do this with Java, and I don't think I should have to do it with Scala to that extent.

If this issue has nothing to do with @inline and the warnings or logs of the inliner, then maybe the compiler should warn the user if s/he puts an explicit type on a final val? Although, the best fix IMO is for the spec to say something different (for Scala 2.12 perhaps?). I don't think that doing nothing is an option.
Maybe update the ticket title to ask for a warning.

I think the intuition is that if there is an explicit type, then conversions are in play:

```scala
final val d: Double = 5
(5: Double)  // no warning under -Ywarn-numeric-widen or -Xlog-implicit-conversions
(i: Double) // warns
```

http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/01-lexical-syntax.html#integer-literals
For instance,
```scala
@inline final val is = Array(1,2,3)
```
would warn.

For constant vals, it says refs are replaced by the RHS.  If the `5` is really `5.0`, which do you use?

Maybe it's obvious and there are no loopholes.  Then you'd get

```scala
final val b: Byte = 42
final val c: Char = 'a' + 1
@inline final val b = (42: Byte)   // warn?
```
Yes. From that ticket:
```
The semantics of constant folding are a source of endless confusion, ignorance, and eventually consternation.
