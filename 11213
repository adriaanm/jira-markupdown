The same applies for a lot of other flags. My approach to transparently work around this was to store the universe in an implicit val, and then `import UniverseCompat._` of the following object in the respective scope:
https://github.com/misberner/generateUpdated/blob/master/src/main/scala-2.10/com/github/misberner/scalamacros/updated/generator/UniverseCompat.scala
For 2.11, this object is empty, as all fields are already imported through `import universe._`.
