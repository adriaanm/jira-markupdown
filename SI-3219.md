In the startup method, a SimpleSwingApplication calls pack() before displaying the frame.  This leads to the unexpected situation where a declared size is completely ignored:


```scala
object Example extends SimpleSwingApplication {
  def top = new MainFrame {
    contents = new Button("Not as big as I thought!")
    size = (1024, 768): Dimension
  }
}
```

I suggest doing a check such that pack() is called as a default only if the size is currently (0,0):


```scala
override def startup(args: Array[String]) {
  val t = top
  if (t.size == new Dimension(0,0))
    t.pack()
  t.visible = true
}
```

(In r21290) Fixed #3219. No review.
