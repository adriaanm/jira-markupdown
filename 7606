In 2.11, it is possible to define macro impl parameters as c.Tree's, not c.Expr[T]'s, and that makes it possible to write a macro impl that matches a macro def featuring a by-name parameter, e.g. something like this:
```scala
object Macros {
  def impl(c: Context)(x: c.Tree) = ???
  def foo[T](x: => T): Any = macro impl
}
```
