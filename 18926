Related to scala/bug#4728. This compiles, the second alternative is chosen
```scala
object t {
  def f(x: Object) = 1
  def f(x: String*) = 2
}
t.f("") // returns 2, should be ambiguous.
```

According to scala/bug#4728, it should be ambiguous. I assume the compiler thinks that `String*` conforms to `Object`. Maybe because it tests if `Seq[String]` conforms to `Object`, not sure.
