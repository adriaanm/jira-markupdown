Related to SI-4728. This compiles, the second alternative is chosen
{code:scala}
object t {
  def f(x: Object) = 1
  def f(x: String*) = 2
}
t.f("") // returns 2, should be ambiguous.
{code}

According to SI-4728, it should be ambiguous. I assume the compiler thinks that {{String*}} conforms to {{Object}}. Maybe because it tests if {{Seq[String]}} conforms to {{Object}}, not sure.
