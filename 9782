Yay, I finally figured out a workaround (been episodically thinking about this bug for some time already):
```scala
class Test {
  trait Foo[T, U]
  object Foo { implicit def foo: Foo[String, Int] = new Foo[String, Int]{} }
  implicit def conv[T, U](s: T)(implicit foo: Foo[T, U]): U = ???
  def foo(c: Int) = ???
  foo("")
}
```

This, however, requires a fix to scala/bug#3346, which is a pull request currently under review: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2822. If you're interested in having this bugfix in 2.11 and have some spare time, I can elaborate on how you can help.
