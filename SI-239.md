The “Scala Syntax Summary” uses non-terminal constructs related to XML (`XmlExpr` and `XmlPattern`) that are not described in this summary.

It can however all be found in “XML expressions and patterns”.

It isn't clear to me whether this is a feature of a bug.

This issue is a sub-element of SI-233.
