The following code completes on 2.7.7 with -Xmx512.  On 2.8.0.RC1, it runs out of heap fairly quickly.

```scala
object StreamLeak {
  def walk(depth: Int, bias: String): Stream[String] = {
    if (depth == 0)
      Stream(bias)
    else {
      Stream.concat(Stream.range(1, 100).map((x: Int) => walk(depth-1, bias + x)))
    }
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("Length: " + walk(3, "space"*1024).length)
  }
}
```

The 'concat' becomes xs.toStream.flatten in the new library.
I'm not sure I've got this one right, but it seems to me that in 2.7.7. GC collects the Stream while length is computed, since the only reference to the original stream was consumed from the stack when `length` is invoked in the example above. This doesn't happen in 2.8.

The difference I see between 2.8 and 2.7.7. is the `length` method. Adding:

```scala
  override def length: Int = {
    var len = 0
    var left = this
    while (!left.isEmpty) {
      len += 1
      left = left.tail
    }
    len
  }
```

to `Stream` solves the problem, it seems - I no longer get the out of memory exception.

I am unable to completely discern why this solves the problem. New `Stream`s have the `length` method defined in `LinearSeqOptimized` which uses a reference to `self`, that is, the head of the stream. Looking over the bytecode:

```scala
  public static int length(scala.collection.LinearSeqOptimized $$this);
     0  aload_0 [$$this]
     1  astore_1 [these]
     ...
```

reveals that `$$this`, or that is, `self` is being kept on the stack all the while. Presumably, this caused the error.
