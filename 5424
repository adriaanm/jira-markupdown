This is extremely helpful, thank you.  I have made alterations such that syntactically invalid signatures can no longer be geneerated, but this is what I was afraid was still out there.  This is important, but right now I don't know how fast I'll be able to get to it.

(See also SI-4067 which I was hoping this would be a duplicate of, but is not.)
