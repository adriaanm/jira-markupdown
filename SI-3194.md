I can't say definitively this is a bug.  But I think it should be.  There is only one thing which "this.x" can mean.  It looks to me like this could be implemented with some extra logic in typedAssign.
{code}
class A(var x: Int)
class B(x: Int) extends A(x) { def update(z: Int) = this.x = z }
{code}
{code}
a.scala:2: error: reassignment to val
class B(x: Int) extends A(x) { def update(z: Int) = this.x = z }
                                                           ^
one error found
{code}
I would expect it to work like the common situation (common in java anyway) where one does:
{code}
def f(x: Int) = this.x = x
{code}
I think this is fundamentally a duplicate of another ticket, but I can't find it right now. The problem is that the constructor parameter does get modelled as a private[this] field. For the duplicate I decided that this should wait until after 2.8 since changing it now would be too risky.

See SI-3861 for a related issue and a workaround to this one.  (TL/DR: give B a self-type of A.)
Here is another related issue.  There does not seem to be any way to get this to compile without changing the name of the parameter in Foo.
{code}
trait Settings {
  type T = Int
  def f: T = 5
}

class Bar(val settings: Settings) { }

class Foo(settings: Settings) extends Bar(settings) {
  def g = settings.f
}
{code}
{code}
a.scala:9: error: private value settings escapes its defining scope as part of type Foo.this.settings.T
  def g = settings.f
      ^
one error found
{code}

> See SI-3861 for a related issue and a workaround to this one.  (TL/DR: give B a self-type of A.)

Now that SI-3861 is fixed, as one might suppose, the workaround no longer works around.
{code}
// This code compiles in 2.8.1 but not since whenever SI-3861 was fixed
// (tested at r24303.)
class A(var x: Int)
class B(x: Int) extends A(x) {
  self: A =>

  def update(z: Int) = this.x = z
}
{code}
