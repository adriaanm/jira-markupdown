In the code

{code}
case class AffineImageShape(axes: Seq[Int]) {
  def this(axes: Array[Int]) = this(axes)
}
{code}

The error is

{quote}
Error:(4, 34) called constructor's definition must precede calling constructor's definition
{quote}

This is true but it would be more helpful to say

{quote}
Error: constructor calls itself
{quote}
