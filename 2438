Confirm fixed with Google Calendar API 1.40.3

The following code example does not compile with Scala-2.8.0.Beta1, but could compile with svn trunk, and functional correctly.

So I think this is fixed.

Code:
```scala
import com.google.gdata.client.calendar._

object Test
{
    def main (args: Array[String]) {
        val myService = new CalendarService("exampleCo-exampleApp-1");
        myService.setUserCredentials("jo@gmail.com", "mypassword");
    }
}
```
