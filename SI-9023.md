According to SLS, a type in value definition(in method definition, too) is not determined by the local type inference, so

```scala
scala> val p = "hello"
p: String = hello

scala> val v = p : p.type
v: p.type = hello
```

seems ok, but

```scala
scala> def v = p : p.type
v: String
```

. Or SLS is wrong?
So
```scala
scala> val v = p : p.type
v: p.type = hello
```
will be a bug with the upcoming specifications?
```scala
val p = "hello"
val q = p : p.type
implicitly[q.type =:= p.type]
```

compiles (wrongly?).
After all, this ticket seems a duplicate of #6767.
Thanks.
