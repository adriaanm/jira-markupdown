One cannot pass a java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap into any
of the existing scala.collections.jcl.* wrappers, so it would be
nice if Scala had a built in wrapper.

```scala
package scala.collection.jcl

class ConcurrentHashMap[K,E]
  (override val underlying : java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[K,E])
  extends scala.collection.jcl.MapWrapper[K,E]
{
  def this() = this(new java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[K,E])

  // java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap's do not support a clone
  // operation.
  override def clone() : Nothing = throw new CloneNotSupportedException
}
```
Now that Martin has stated at Scala 2.8 will drop JDK 1.4 compatibility, a
wrapper for java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap can be added into Scala.

The original comment didn't state the reason to add this wrapper, but the
ConcurrentHashMap implements a few methods that is not provided by the
java.util.Map interface, so wrapping a ConcurrentHashMap with the
MapWrapper looses the additional method I use:

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html

Here's a fuller implementation:

```scala
class ConcurrentHashMap[K,E]
  (override val underlying : java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[K,E])
  extends scala.collection.jcl.MapWrapper[K,E]
{
  def this() = this(new java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[K,E])

  /**
   * java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap's do not support a clone
   * operation.
   */
  override def clone() : Nothing = throw new CloneNotSupportedException

  /**
   * Atomically insert an elemenet into the map associated with a key
   * only if the key is not already in the map.
   *
   * @param key the key to insert the value with
   * @param element the element to add to the map
   * @return Some() with the key's value if the key has a value in the
   *         map; None otherwise
   */
  def putIfAbsent(key : K, element : E) : Option[E] =
  {
    val result = underlying.putIfAbsent(key, element)
    if (result == null) {
      None
    }
    else {
      Some(result)
    }
  }
}
```
I'm not sure there's anything more which can be done usefully in JavaConversions ... the following already works,

```scala
scala> import scala.collection.JavaConversions._                        
import scala.collection.JavaConversions._

scala> val m = new java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[Int, String]  
m: java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[Int,String] = {}

scala> m += (1 -> "1", 2 -> "2", 3 -> "3")                              
res0: scala.collection.mutable.Map[Int,String] = Map(2 -> 2, 1 -> 1, 3 -> 3)

scala> m
res1: java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[Int,String] = {2=2, 1=1, 3=3}

scala> m(2)
res2: String = 2

scala> m.putIfAbsent(3, "23")                                           
res3: String = 3

scala> m.putIfAbsent(4, "4") 
res4: String = null

scala> m.clone              
<console>:9: error: method clone cannot be accessed in java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[Int,String]
       m.clone
         ^
```

This really leaves only the improved signature for putIfAbsent (ie. returning an Option, rather than using null to indicate None) and it feels like this would be best supported by adding that method to the main Scala Map trait.
