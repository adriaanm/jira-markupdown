Consider the common case of defining a transformation that preserves the structure of some type:

```scala
sealed abstract class Tree
final case class Program(str: String) extends Tree
final case class Literal(n: Int) extends Tree

object Foo {
  def transform[T <: Tree](t: T): T = t match {
    case Program(str) => Program(str + "_")
    case Literal(n)   => Literal(n + 1)
  }
}
```

This fails now with type errors:
```scala
transform.scala:7: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Program
 required: T
    case Program(str) => Program(str + "_")
                         ^
transform.scala:8: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Literal
 required: T
    case Literal(n)   => Literal(n + 1)
                         ^
two errors found
```

Could we do better? Given that {{T <: Program}} on branch 1, and {{Program}} is final, could we infer that {{T == Program}}? This looks like a common case, and a worthwhile ehancement.
> Given that T <: Program on branch 1, and Program is final, could we infer that T == Program?

No, since T could be a self-type of an instance of Program.
I'm not sure if Lauri Alanko's comment is outdated or just not valid. Self-type are allowed on traits but must be satisfied by concrete instances; any instance would have to be a (forbidden) subclass of `Program`. The given example still gives the same failure on 2.10.0 HEAD.
Paolo: he means it could be the singleton type of an instance, which finality does not preclude.
```scala
object Bar {
  val x = Program("bippy")
  Foo.transform[x.type](x)
}
```
