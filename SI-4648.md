Spec says "Furthermore, every user-defined Scala class also inherits the trait scala.ScalaObject." This should be updated to reflect the fact that pure interfaces (traits with only abstract members) are not given a ScalaObject parent.  If possible it would be good to provide as well some motivation for this distinction.
Looks like {{ScalaObject}} is on the way out, anyway, so the spec could be updated in 2.11 to remove it.
