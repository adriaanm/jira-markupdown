When compiling a mix of Java and Scala files, scalac will report an error on otherwise valid Java files.

To reproduce, create 2 files:

Foo.java:
----------
public class Foo<T extends Comparable<? super T>> {}
----------

Bar.scala:
----------
class Bar {
   val quux = new Foo[Int]()
}
----------

And compile them using scalac:


$ scalac Foo.java Bar.scala
Foo.java:1: error: illegal cyclic reference involving type T
public class Foo<T extends Comparable<? super T>> {
                                      ^
one error found


Impact: it's not possible to use scala for mixed Scala/Java projects containing such declarations.
I think this is still occurring when the java class in question is being referenced from any scala class.

This is the scenario:

`A.java`

```
public class A<T extends Comparable<? super T>> implements Comparable<T> {
  public int compareTo(T other) {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

`B.scala`

```
class B {
  println (new A)
}
```

- Command *
`scalac  ./*.java ./\*.scala`

If I compile just the java files, it works. If the scala code doesn't refer to that java class, it works.

```
$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.11.1 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL
```
Any news on this bug? It is unfortunate that Scala can not be mixed with Java classes that implement, e.g. `Comparable`.
