The only way I can get this effect is by having multiple {outgoing_change_flag} entries configured as text decorations. Please reopen if you're able to provide a reliable way of reproducing this problem.

Some things it would be helpful if you would investigate ... Is it possible that you've managed to get an {outgoing_change_flag} duplicated somehow?

Also, I'm using the built in CVS Team provider along with Subclipse rather than Subversive ... could you check if the behaviour you're seeing is present with no Subversion plugin installed, or with Subclipse?
