I've also run this problem with Protobuf generated code. A workaround for this issue is to modify the generated Java code with the full path to Builder

{code}
public QueueMessage.Stage.Builder toBuilder() { return newBuilder(this); }
{code}

However, it's a pain to have to tweak generated code. I'd like to see this bug fixed.
As seems always to be the case, as soon as someone mentions "maven" they're describing a bug that I cannot reproduce.

If you think this is not some sort of maven configuration bug, please tell me how to reproduce it without involving maven (else this ticket will be closed as invalid.)
Should have thought to try just one file before submitting the problem. The issue is an interaction between a list of Java and Scala files.

It's not pretty but I attached a tar file with the source files and a bash script showing how the compiler is being invoked.  I couldn't include my scala jars because of the upload size limit so you will need to tweak the script to point to your jars before the script will run. I downloaded and built the latest nightly build and can reproduce the issue.

There will be a list compiler errors because I only included a subset of files that I found to show the issue. My friend "the ambiguous Builder" message is buried in there.

Please let me know if I can provide any other information.  TIA for your efforts.
