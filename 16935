a simple definition of a case object:
```
case object Bippy
```
is serialized with a different serialVersionUID between 2.9.1 and 2.9.2. This causes issues in (for example) communication between remote actors running under different versions of scala. In the attached file TestSer.scala, first run "Ser" under 2.9.1 and then "Deser" under 2.9.2 and observe the following exception:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.io.InvalidClassException: test.Bippy$; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 4073568934824676524, local class serialVersionUID = 8501393720257665998

  at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject0(ObjectInputStream.java:1328)	
  at java.io.ObjectInputStream.readObject(ObjectInputStream.java:350)
```

I would contend that this should be marked as a binary incompatibility.
