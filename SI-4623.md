The Unit value () does in fact support asInstanceOf, isInstanceOf, and ##. The specification section 12.2.3 states "[i]t implements only three methods equals, hashCode, and toString from class Any."

```scala
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    ().asInstanceOf[Unit]
    ().isInstanceOf[Unit]
    ().##
    println("uh oh")
  }
}
```

That should either not compile or fail at run-time, the spec doesn't explicitly say which. Instead, it runs. This could be related to #1245, I dunno.

Additionally, asInstanceOf allows casting to AnyRef (boxing I assume) which is especially important to document.
Please respond to what I said about boxing/unboxing. If you feel that "implements X" wasn't intended exclusively for Unit, the auto-boxing/unboxing still should be in the spec.

```
The test x .asInstanceOf[T ] is treated specially if T is a numeric value type
(ยง12.2). In this case the cast will be translated to an application of a conversion
method x.toT (ยง12.2.1). For non-numeric values x the operation will raise a
ClassCastException.
```

```scala
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val o: AnyRef = ().asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
    o.asInstanceOf[Unit] //should be a ClassCastException                       
    println("no problems")
  }
}
```

There is no toUnit, as this won't compile:
```scala
object Main {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val o: AnyRef = ().asInstanceOf[AnyRef]
    o.toUnit
  }
}
```

I can open a separate ticket if you'd like.
The spec language you quote says that:

 1) given x.asInstanceOf[T]
 2) if T is a numeric value type
 3) and if x is a member of a non-numeric value type
 4) then there will be a CCE.

().asInstanceOf[AnyRef] fails to meet 2.

scala> ().asInstanceOf[Int]
java.lang.ClassCastException: scala.runtime.BoxedUnit cannot be cast to java.lang.Integer
	at scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime.unboxToInt(Unknown Source)
	at .<init>(<console>:8)
Okay thanks for your patience Paul. I had the o.asInstanceOf[Unit] line in mind, but now I understand that since it's not a **numeric** value type, just a value type, the section of the spec does not qualify.

Still, regarding, the lack of documentation of boxing Unit in the spec, let me give this one more try.

```
/** Type cast; needs to be inlined to work as given */ */
def asInstanceOf[A]: A = this match {
case x: A => x
case _ => if (this eq null) this
else throw new ClassCastException()
}

```

I don't understand what inlining has to do with it, but this code does not compile:
```scala

object Program {

  () match {
    case x: AnyRef => x
    case _ => if (() eq null) ()
              else throw new ClassCastException()
  }
}
```

```scala
$ scalac Program.scala 
Program.scala:4: error: scrutinee is incompatible with pattern type;
 found   : AnyRef
 required: Unit
    case x: AnyRef => x
            ^
Program.scala:5: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: ?{val eq(x$1: ?>: Null(null) <: Any): ?}
Note: primitive types are not implicitly converted to AnyRef.
You can safely force boxing by casting x.asInstanceOf[AnyRef].
    case _ => if (() eq null) ()
                  ^
two errors found
```

If I understand the pattern matching section correctly, this behavior is fine. However, there's still nothing in the spec to explain why () can be cast explicitly to boxed types. Implicit boxing unboxing in 12.5.1 only mentions JVM primitives, not Unit.
