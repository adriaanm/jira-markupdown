```scala
scala> object X { 0;  (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b))   }
<console>:1: error: ';' expected but '=>' found.
       object X { 0;  (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b))   }
```


Shouldn't this situation be allowed?  A function literal is an expression, and an expression is usable as a statement.  I tried to make Issue 1564, but I ran into this issue.

On a related note, the following output is weird:
```scala
scala> def x() = { 0; (a : Int, b : Int) => println(List(a, b)) ; 0  }
x: ()(Int, Int) => Int
```

Shouldn't x be a function from ()=>Int ?
