The problem is that DCE considers the following instructions in `Test$delayedInit$body.apply()` to be redundant, and removes them:
```
    7	LOAD_MODULE object Foo
    7	STORE_LOCAL(variable a1)
```

Compiling with all optimizations except DCE ( `-Yinline -Yinline-handlers -Yclosure-elim` ) doesn't show this bug.
