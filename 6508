The problem is that DCE considers the following instructions in {{Test$delayedInit$body.apply()}} to be redundant, and removes them:

{noformat}
    7	LOAD_MODULE object Foo
    7	STORE_LOCAL(variable a1)
{noformat}

Compiling with all optimizations except DCE ( {{-Yinline -Yinline-handlers -Yclosure-elim}} ) doesn't show this bug.
