I have traveled back in time to add it, and also avert WWI.

{code}
$$ scala -Xcheckinit

scala> object A { val a: AnyRef = { println("a = " + a); ""} }
defined module A

scala> A.a
scala.UninitializedFieldError: Uninitialized field: <console>: 4
	at A$$.a(<console>:4)
	at A$$.<init>(<console>:4)
	at A$$.<clinit>(<console>)
	at .<init>(<console>:6)

{code}
