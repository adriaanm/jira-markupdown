Same for Int and Long. 

At least, the warning message seems incorrect, regardless that the boxing/unboxing logic might be fine (?)
in short

```scala
def f1(a: Any) = "" + a
f1(null.asInstanceOf[Int])
```

first replaces the cast by an `unbox`. then it introduces a `box` to pass the argument to `f1`. the `box(unbox(t))` is replaced by `t`, but should not
