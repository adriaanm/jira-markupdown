It seems that this only occurs when a val binding is used.  The following seems to work okay.
```scala
object Test extends Application {
	def a = { lazy val y = 42; y } 
}
```
So a temporary, but tedious, workaround would be to write.
```scala
object Test extends Application {
	def _a = { lazy val y = 42; y } 
        val a = _a
}
```
