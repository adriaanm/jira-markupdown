How can I find out what the compiler was doing when this error arose? Its a bit hard to produce a minimal test case without this.

A decidedly un-minimal test case is here: http://scalaz.googlecode.com/svn/branches/scala-2.8, SVN revision 825.

I'm on version 2.8.0.r18583-b20090827020153
It sounds like SI-2201, which I have a patch for but do not want to commit without it being approved (or more likely, improved) by martin or adriaan.  That was the bug that needed to be fixed for scalacheck to compile and it's very believable that scalaz and scalacheck would induce the same bugs.

If you want you can build the repo with the patch and see if it works - or hopefully it'll be in trunk soon.  http://github.com/paulp/scala/tree/scalacheck
I've just tried the patched compiler. It gets past the first instance of this error -- encountered compiling the scalacheck sources, which are svn:external-ed into the Scalaz build -- but there is another case in triggered by the Scalaz sources proper.

I've got it pinned down in the debugger, so I'll narrow it down and post a test case soon.

I took a look at this in the debugger, and attached an analysis. Still can't pare it down to a small example, unfortunately :(

{code}

      Transforming unit Pointed.scala. Inspection of the AST here shows that 's' in PromisePure(s) already has the wrong symbol. I expect it to
      be the parameter 's' from PromisePointed, instead it is bound to the parameter 's' from another file.
      
        // Pointed.scala
        trait Pointed[P[_]] extends Functor[P] with Pure[P]

        object Pointed {
           import concurrent._
           implicit def PromisePointed(implicit s: Strategy[Unit]) = pointed[Promise]
   // = Pointed.this.pointed(
   //         scalaz.this.Functor.PromiseFunctor(),
   //   scalaz.this.Pure.PromisePure(s).$$asInstanceOf[scalaz.Pure]())
   //                                |__ 's' bound to out-of-scope implicit
   //                                     param of Applicative.PromiseApplicative()!
        }
      
        //Applicative.scala:
        trait Applicative[Z[_]] extends Pointed[Z] with Apply[Z] {
          override def fmap[A, B](fa: Z[A], f: A => B): Z[B] = apply(pure(f), fa)
        }

        object Applicative {
           implicit def PromiseApplicative(implicit s: Strategy[Unit]) = applicative[Promise]           
        }

Oddly, scalac doesn't produce the error, but you can see the reference to an out-of-scope symbol from test.A.B2 with `-uniqid -print`:

Implicits are being cached too aggressively. The patch recently applied for SI-2201 should be reviewed in light of this test case.

Implicits.cacheResult returns T1.T1FromT2(t2_b1) here, which is bogus. Even though T1.T1FromT2 was found outside of the scope of A.B1, this implicit expression should _not_ be cached, as it includes the bound variable t2_b1 from this scope.

SearchResult could be augmented with an attribute `cacheable`. In Implicits.bestImplicits(), if the first search in the local context succeeds, return SearchResult(tree, subst, cacheable = false). This would need to be propagated for SearchResults that themselves depend on implicits.

Implicits.cacheResult would then ensure that only cacheable SearchResult-s are cached.

Replying to [comment:10 retronym]:
> Could you consider the attached patch? It is based on my 'implicit-caching' tree on github, mentioned above. Two new test cases are included, it simplifies implicit caching, and is ready to integrate.

Very sorry nobody has responded to you on this; the problem is that martin is almost the only person who can properly assess a patch in this area, and he is buried.  I am promoting myself to basically-capable-of-assessing and will take a look at all this right now.

On a separate note, thank you very much for your work on SI-2337, which is definitely SI-1697.  I already had that fairly specifically diagnosed, but fixing it has been far more elusive than it ought to be because of the opaque way the pattern matcher constructs its automaton.  Regardless, another pair of eyes on these bugs is tremendously useful, and test cases and actual patches puts you in a seriously elite group -- so please don't be discouraged by the difficulty (unusually high right now with 2.8 around the corner) of getting the attention of committers.
Okay -- leaving gratitude aside for a moment -- back to to bits.

To be clear, the latest patch I propose is http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/attachment/ticket/2316/no-owner.patch . It is based on: http://github.com/retronym/scala/commits/implicit-caching (not implicit-cache as I wrote above.)

The key change is

{code}
-  val implicitsCache = new LinkedHashMap[AnyRef, SearchResult]
+  val implicitsCache = new LinkedHashMap[Type, List[List[ImplicitInfo]]]
{code}

This cache is interrogated when looking for implicits from the implicit import scope, that is, to look for an implicit of type T in the companion object of T and the companion objects of its super-types. 

Previously, the entire !SearchResult was cached, which could contain symbols local to the scope of the search that were used as implicit parameters, and hence not safely cacheable. These tests demonstrate best the problems with this approach. r1

With the patch, the cache only stores information gleaned from the implicit import scope r2. When no in-scope implicit is found, the current context and cached implicitInfoss are used to find a search result r3, which may contain bound variables used as implicit parameters. As such, it is not cached.

I tried a more complex version that detected SearchResults that contained no bound variables and cached them, but this was complex, not driven by performance measurements and as such probably wrongheaded.

r1 http://github.com/retronym/scala/commit/f0bfbfc3234bd9c7349e740b6dff50aac5f7ca4b
r2 http://github.com/retronym/scala/blob/implicit-caching/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Implicits.scala#L578
r3 http://github.com/retronym/scala/blob/implicit-caching/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/Implicits.scala#L695
Every time an implicit search occurs, this information is combined with the 

I haven't done any performance testing, but to paraphrase Joe Armstrong, an incorrect implementation can be made arbitrarily fast.
I timed the compilation of Scalaz, patched to workaround this bug, using scalac r18697 nightly, and r18701 + the patch. The time in implicits, and total compile time were almost identical over a few repeats.

I just noticed two minor things to clean up:

scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/util/Statistics.scala:60

Delete this line logging of "implicit cache coverage", it is now always 100%


scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/ast/Trees.scala:1717

remove 'case' from 'case class !TreeTypeSubstituter'
