       def f(s: String = _)
                         ^

Expected: compilation is passed and null used as default value

the restriction applies here as well: for each default argument we generate a method returning that value. a method definition
```scala
  def init$$default$$1: C = _
```
is not valid, so we can't support this without major hackery.
