There's regression from 2.9.2 when it comes to nested case class equality:

```scala
trait K { 
case class CC(name: String) 
}

object Foo extends K 
object Bar extends K

val b1 = Foo.CC("b") 
val b2 = Bar.CC("b")

b1 == b2 // false under 2.9, true under 2.10-RC5
```

This change is caused by different scheme used for case class equality. It changed from:

```scala
def oldEq(that: Any) = that match { 
case K.this.CC(n) => n == this.name && that.asInstanceOf[K.this.CC].canEqual(this) 
case _ => false 
}
```

to using asInstanceOf, like:

```scala
def newEq(that: Any) = that.isInstanceOf[K.this.CC] && { 
val f = that.asInstanceOf[K.this.CC] 
(f.name == this.name) && f.canEqual(this) 
}
```

The change has been introduced in https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/f7f5b50848

Since this is a silent change of user's code behavior I'm marking this blocker for 2.10.1.
