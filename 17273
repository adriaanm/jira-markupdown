{code}
class Indirection[T](implicit val c: CompanionProvider[T]) {
  def indirect: c.CompanionT = c.provide
}

// error: value foo is not a member of _1.c.CompanionT
new Indirection[Foo].indirect.foo
{code}

this doesn't work because `new Indirection[Foo]: Indirection[Foo]`,
i.e., there's no information about the implicit value that was inferred for `c` in the type of the target of the selection of `indirect`
