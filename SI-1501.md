Somewhat related to SI-1500, here is another problem with type inference and annotated types / custom {{AnnotationChecker}}s.

Example `AnnotationChecker`:
```scala
    object checker extends AnnotationChecker {

      /** Check annotations to decide whether tpe1 <:< tpe2 */
      def annotationsConform(tpe1: Type, tpe2: Type): Boolean = {

        tpe1.attributes.forall(a1 => tpe2.attributes.forall(a2 => a1.atp <:< a2.atp))

      }
    }
```

Test code:
```scala
    class xyz[A] extends TypeConstraint

    def loopWhile[T](cond: =>Boolean)(body: =>(Unit @xyz[T])): Unit @ xyz[T] = {{
      if (cond) {{
        body
        loopWhile[T](cond)(body)
```
```scala
    def test() = {{
      var x = 7
      loopWhile(x != 0) {{
        x = x - 1
        (): @xyz[Int]
```
```scala

```

Compiler error:
```scala
<console>:19: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Unit @xyz[Int]
 required: Unit @xyz[Nothing]
               (): @xyz[Int]
```

This time, the reason is that when solving a system of typing constraints, each variable is either minimized or maximized, depending on the combined variance of its occurences. Now, the code that checks the variance does not look for occurences in type annotations, so a variable that occurs only there is reported as "doesn't occur anywhere" and will be mapped to `Nothing`.
