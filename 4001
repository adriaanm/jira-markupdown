Frankly this does not look like a bug to me. Scala's handling of arrays works *because* arrays are treated as invariant. If you undermine that with uncheckedVariance, anything can happen.  Generally, an annotation with an uncheckedXXX annotation means that the programmer takes responsibility if the program crashes.
