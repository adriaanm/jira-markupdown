Docs (http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/quasiquotes.html) haven't been updated yet, and the example in http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/quasiquotes.html still has two type errors:
1. the code must use name.toString.capitalize instead of name.capitalize. I guess that's an actual bug in the example code.
2. `q"class $name extends AnyRef \{ ..$\{body ++ newdefs} }"` is still missing a toList call, which might be an instance of this bug.

Hence, this should be reopened.
