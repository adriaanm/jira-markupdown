```scala
package test

trait ImportMe {
  def foo(i: Int) = 1
  def foo(s: String) = 2
}

class Test(val importMe: ImportMe) {
  import importMe._
  import importMe._

  // A.scala:12: error: reference to foo is ambiguous;
  // it is imported twice in the same scope by
  // import importMe._
  // and import importMe._
  //   println(foo(1))
  //           ^
  println(foo(1))
}
```

Note: if there's only one def foo in ImportMe, there's no problem.
"This is an excerpt from the Ensime codebase, which compiles fine with 2.9.2 and 2.10.0-M4."

Please be extremely careful with claims like this; when you are wrong, it is very misleading about where the problem was introduced.
```scala
% m4scalac /scala/trunk/test/files/pos/t6117.scala 
/scala/trunk/test/files/pos/t6117.scala:18: error: reference to foo is ambiguous;
it is imported twice in the same scope by
import importMe._
and import importMe._
  println(foo(1))
          ^
one error found
% m3scalac /scala/trunk/test/files/pos/t6117.scala 
%
```
It's a completely understandable error, especially if ensime compiled and the snippet doesn't - I'm just drawing attention to it because the more reliable the speaker is in general, the longer it is before one questions the input data.  It's not a fair universe if being reliable imposes a greater obligation to be reliable, but indeed it is not a fair universe.
Regression introduced (by me) in the fix for #4831
