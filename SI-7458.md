Add __FILE__ and __LINE__ meta-constants (or some variant) for use in logging and debugging.
You can implement this without compiler support in 2.10.0 with a macro.

{code}
scala> import language.experimental.macros, reflect.macros.Context
import language.experimental.macros
import reflect.macros.Context

scala> def __FILE__impl(c: Context) = c.literal(c.macroApplication.pos.source.toString)
__FILE__impl: (c: scala.reflect.macros.Context)c.Expr[String]

scala> def __FILE__ = macro __FILE__impl
__FILE__: String

scala> __FILE__
res1: String = <console>

scala> def __LINE__impl(c: Context) = c.literal(c.macroApplication.pos.line)
__LINE__impl: (c: scala.reflect.macros.Context)c.Expr[Int]

scala> def __LINE__ = macro __LINE__impl
__LINE__: Int

scala> __LINE__
res2: Int = 17
{code}

There has been a proposal to standardize an extension of this, Source Locations, which would allow you to implicitly pass the source location from a call site to some method.

See: http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/source-locations.html

That effort was put on hold as it was shows that even this can now be done as a macro. But we haven't moved that out of a prototype.
