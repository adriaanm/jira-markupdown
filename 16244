Paul and me stumbled upon this during ScalaDays. It doesn't seem to be fixed in trunk yet and I couldn't find a ticket so I'm creating one...

There is a check in `Inliners.scala` that prevents inlining of private methods (their call sites are invokespecial, not invokevirtual = Dynamic):
```scala
for (i <- bb) {
  i match {
    case CALL_METHOD(msym, Dynamic) =>
      if (analyzeInc(msym, i, bb)) break
    case _ => ()
  }
  info = tfa.interpret(info, i)
}
```
