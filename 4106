Oh, wonderful.  I wasn't seeing the warning because the check looking for the string "genjvm" which is not actually the name of the phase.  I, having catlike reflexes with respect to the phase names, was entering it as "-Ycheck:jvm" which is what it is supposed to be.  You guys were smart enough to enter the string it was looking for.

** NOTICE! I'M FIXING IT! **

That means it's -Ycheck:jvm, and -Ycheck:genjvm refers to a non-existent phase.  The options which take a phase argument should probably fail on mystery strings, but right now they silently ignore.  Still, you know if it checked by examining the output: it will always say "[Now checking: jvm]" if it understood you, and it will be silent if it did not.
