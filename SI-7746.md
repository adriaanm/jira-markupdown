After mentioning None, the next example lets a wildcard escape, the next is too specific, and the last is too broad. The things not covered should be some variation on: None, Some(x forSome x not in Some(5))

```scala
scala> def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x match { case Some(Some(5)) => true }
<console>:7: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: None, Some((x: T forSome x not in Some[?])), Some(Some((x: Any forSome x not in 5))), Some(_)
       def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x match { case Some(Some(5)) => true }
                                ^
f: [T](x: Option[T])Boolean
```
Focusing initially on the spurious `Some(_)` case:

This counter example is rendered from the model:

```
(0)  = {scala.Tuple2@3801}"(V1=Some[?]#8,true)"
(1)  = {scala.Tuple2@3803}"(V3=5#10,false)"
```

V1 represents the scrutinee; V3 the contents of the nested Some.

This comes from the `forced` part of `findAllModels`. I've removed that here: https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/scala:2.10.x...ticket/7746
```
Tracing out SI-7746:

def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x match {
    case Some(Some(5)) => true // It would fail on the following inputs: None, Some((x: T forSome x not in Some[?])), Some(Some((x: Any forSome x not in 5))), Some(_)
  }
unassigned List(V1=None.type#11, V3=5#10) in Map(V1=Some[?]#8 -> true, V2=Some[?]#9 -> false)

var assignment for model Map(V1=Some[?]#8 -> true, V3=5#10 -> false):
V1(=x1: Option[?]) == (Some[?])  != ()
V3(=x1.x.x: Any) == ()  != (5)
describing (V1,List(Some[?]),List(),Map(),class Some,true)
described as: Some(_)
Taking the unassigned V3=5 as false leads us to simplify the model to a point where we suggest Some(_) as a counter example. But for V3 to be assignable at all (as i understand things), we need V2 = Some[?] to be true.

Is Map(V1=Some[?]#8 -> true, V3=5#10 -> false): a valid counter example that is wrongly described, or an invalid counter example? (To me, it seems like the latter.)

I'm very open to improvements to the counter example algorithm (though I'm
getting more anxious about changing any of this in 2.10 due to the risk of
undetected regressions). I really wish I had more time to work on this
right now, but I can't. I'd be more at ease if this was happening in
master. I have budgeted time during the polish milestones to work on this
kind of stuff (sept-oct).

Yeah, the whole logic of dependencies between variables' types is not encoded in the formula. That's why the counter examples need to be pruned (https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/master/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/transform/patmat/MatchAnalysis.scala#L352)
```
Amusingly this has found a way to get worse. It now throws an "Option()" in with the others.
```scala
scala> def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x match { case Some(Some(5)) => true }
<console>:7: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following inputs: None, Option(), Some((x: T forSome x not in Some[?])), Some(Some((x: Any forSome x not in 5))), Some(_)
       def f[T](x: Option[T]) = x match { case Some(Some(5)) => true }
                                ^
f: [T](x: Option[T])Boolean
```
Another test case from #8430. I've just submitted a PR to fix the non-determinism aspect of that, but I think the incomplete counter example list is a variant of this bug.

```
$ cat Test.scala

Running "scalac Test.scala" will output randomly one of the two warning messages above. One of them is more complete than the other, but is still missing the LetL(UnitLit) case.
