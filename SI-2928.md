In 2.8.0.r20598:

{{object scala.tools.nsc.util.ClassPath}} has the following member:
{code}
  var XO = false
{code}

`XO` is modified when initializing `classPath` for a `Global` instance.  Effectively, multiple `Global` instances in the same `ClassLoader` must have the same `-optimise` setting.
(In r20614) Removed static state from global object ClassPath object,
and some minor repositioning while in there.  Closes SI-2928,
but the intentions behind -optimise being intertwined with
ClassPath could really use some source comments.  Review by rytz.
