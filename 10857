I'm not sure I understand. The relevant sentence in the spec (https://github.com/adriaanm/scala-ref-markdown/blob/master/03-lexical-syntax.md#character-literals) is:
> The character is either a printable unicode character or is described by an [escape sequence](#escape-sequences).

This explicitly allows  '\u000A' because it uses an escape sequence. Are you saying the Scala program
{code}
val c = '
'
{code}

is accepted somehow? I can't reproduce that interpretation
