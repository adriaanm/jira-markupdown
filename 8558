I believe the cycle was valid: although adding {{scala.AnyRef}} as a parent is a no-op, determining that "AnyRef" binds to said class requires interrogation of enclosing imports, which is enough to expose the cycle.

I added a neg test case to show the situation, and also rearranged the imports to avoid flying so close to the sun.
