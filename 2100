Paul,

I think you may be mistaken that this was an intentional change.

The reason addString behaves that way is to support this behavior of toString which is the same in both 2.7.5 and trunk:
```scala
scala> Stream.from(1).toString
res1: String = Stream(1, ?)
```

were you aware of this when you closed the ticket...?

I really think the new behavior of mkString is nonsensical. It's good for toString not to force, because toString is used during debugging, in the REPL, etc. But if I use mkString, I am explicitly saying I want to build a string out of the contents of the stream.
