  implicit def compute(a :Int, b :int) = if (a > b) Some(a - b) else None
    
  test (1,2)                      // works not
  test (1,2) (compute)            // works
  test[Int,Int] (1,2)             // works also  
}

The first usage does not work because the implicit parameter type of _result_ is assumed to be {{(Int, Int) => Option[Nothing]}} instead of a generic one.

I'm not sure if this behavior is intentional, because with generic implicit pts ambiguities can arise. However, if and only if so one should be forced to resolve this by explicitly adding the generic types, e.g. {{test[Int,Int](1,2)}} or {{test(1,2)(compute)}}.
stupid example, but just add this right after the _compute_ def in the example above:

{{implicit def compute2[A](a :A, b :A) = if (a. hashCode > b. hashCode) Some(a) else None}}

I'm not an implicit expert, so might be that the most concrete match (here Int) wins and there is no ambiguity. Depends on the exact language spec, which I don't remeber..
The most specific one should be taken, e.g. the following prints 23:
{code}
  def m(i: Int) = 23
  def m[T](x: T) = 42
  println(m(3))
{code}

According to the spec. "implicit parameters are inferred after any type arguments are inferred". So I think 
{code}
  test (1,2)
{code} 
should compile.
