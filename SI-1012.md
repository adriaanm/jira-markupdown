Hi,

When are going to see support for latex via the listing package
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/listings/) - which is
considered to be the standard way by many people to include source code into a
latex document.

Thanks 
The package does not support Scala, but you can add an other language.

Attached you can find the definition of Scala (`lstlang0.sty`). You have
to copy this file into the directory "listings" of your latex distribution.

Usage:
```scala
\begin{lstlisting}[laguage=scala]
   val x = 1
\end{lstlisting}
```
