 would like to create ScalaDoc entries to every val and def of my class. The problem is that the vals lie inside a pattern definition, and don't know how to use the /** */ syntax.

Example:
{code}
class C(id: String) {
   val (part1, part2) = {
         .....
         (expr1, expr2)
   }
}
{code}
I would like a solution for documenting part1 and part2.
I propose this syntax:
{code}
 val (
    /** Part one. */
    x,
    /** Part two. */
    y
  ) = (1, 2)
{code}

I've read before asking [this documentation|https://wiki.scala-lang.org/display/SW/Tags+and+Annotations] about ScalaDoc and asked in [Stack Overflow|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24932743/how-do-i-document-vals-in-pattern-definitions].
