The problem is that the anonymous function `() => baz` gets an unnecessary outer pointer, initialized in its constructor. And its constructor is called before the super constructor of the IP class:

{code}
IP.this.baz = baz$$1;
IP.super.this({
  (new IP$$$$anonfun$$$$init$$$$1(IP.this, baz$$1): Function0)
});
{code}

Either the anonfun should not get the useless outer pointer, or this code should be forbidden by the type checker.
