Situations when does work:[[BR]]

- refs to items declared in java[[BR]]
- refs to items declared in scala-library[[BR]]
- ref to an item declared in the same Scala project (probably, in the same file) if the file whith this declaration was changed and successfully rebuilt during the IDE session.[[BR]]
[[BR]]
At all other cases Ctrl-click doesn't work for me (r15271 is in use currently).
As well as the working cases you've liste, I'm able to ctrl-click and navigate from a Scala project to another Scala project, from a Scala project to a Java project and a Java project to a Scala project. Ctrl-click not working relative to an unbuilt or only partially built project is expected behaviour.

If you can put together a small reproducible example of a case where navigation fails, please reopen this with the project(s) attached.
Just create something as simple as 

```scala
class Click {
  def foo = 1
  def bar = foo
}
```

Build it, restart the IDE, try click to foo in bar definition - nothing. Then edit at any way (add/delete space, for example) the file - Ctrl-click begins to work.

Resume: Ctrl-click begins to work after a file was changed by editor during the IDE session. This situation doesn't depend on click-target source - the same Scala file, a Scala file in the same project or a Scala file in some another project from this one depends on.

The issue doesn't depend on Eclipse version (takes place with 3.3.1.1 and 3.4).
Your Click example work fine for me with the trunk. r15271 is pretty old: could you try again with tomorrows nightly build on Eclipse 3.4 and reopen if you're still seeing the issue.
Miles,

I use always fresh built (almost daily update - depends on trunk activity). Ok, have tried with current r15690. There are two use cases:

1. create new Scala project, add 'Click' class, build, restart - works!

2. add 'Click' class to existing project (~260KB of code), build, restart - doesn't work :-(


I have digged in all projects configuration files and have eliminated small differences between them - doesn't help.

Can exceptions (from Eclipse's log) shown below influence to the situation? There is something with presentation :-)

Have you checked that in the second case (ie. when you add your Click class to the existing project) that a class file is actually created?

I very strongly suspect that your issue is somewhere else, and the ctrl-click failure is just a symptom.

BTW, please try again with tomorrow's nightly ... it's possible that today's fix for #1165 has had an effect.
Yes, Click.class takes place inside the bin dir.
#1165 was fixed (thanks!) in r15688, and I'm with r15690 already.
OK, thanks.

Just to clarify, is ctrl-click only not working for you in than the larger project you just mentioned (ie. the ~260KB of code)? If that's the case, are you able to distill a small reproducible test case from it?
Aha, it seems like have found: just created new project at not-default place (i.e. not in 'myDir' dir form start up script: eclipse -clean ~~data myDir). Miles, does such test case work for you? Will not reopen the bug before you verify the issue :~~)
You'll have to explain what you've done in a little more detail. Do you mean your project is located outside your Eclipse workspace?
OK, thanks.

Could you describe the steps you go through to create a Scala project outside the workspace?
Nothing not-obvious:[[BR]]


- menu File - New - Scala Project[[BR]]
- turn off "Use default location" checkbox[[BR]]
- choose some dir[[BR]]
- set project name[[BR]]
- click "Finish"[[BR]]
- in project explorer create some package,[[BR]]
- add to this package new class (say, above 'Click')[[BR]]
- build[[BR]]
- restart the IDE[[BR]]
- get the issue[[BR]]
- edit (change) the class[[BR]]
- Ctrl-click begins to work after editing[[BR]]
- restart the IDE[[BR]]
- get the issue again till next file editing[[BR]]
BTW, Miles, the issue takes place since time *before* you have joined to the plugin development. So, it isn't "something new".
Unfortunately, the same issue takes place for Outline vew (and Ctrl-O) - if project files are outside default workspace, cursor locates at the very beginning of the file (well, selecting appropriate number or chars :-)).

Miles, will you be so kind to rise the issue priority in your TODO list? - two **such** handy features seem to have common failure reason.

Have changed the Summary field.
Can you persuade me that this really is that high a priority? Granted it should work, but the typical case really is projects nested within the workspace. What's stopping you moving your projects into a workspace?
If these projects are in CVS can't you just check them out in your Eclipse workspace? Even in if the canonical corporate sanctioned build location is else where it seems that you ought to be able to at least do development within a workspace.

But I do agree this is a bug and it needs to be fixed ...
(prewarning: I understand nothing in an Eclipse plugins development)

Digging in the plugin code and call chains  (with multiple printlns and rebuildings), I have found (at least I think so) the place causing the bug. The call chain is:

```scala
TypersPresentations 'def hyperlink' 
TypersPresentations decode(symbol : Symbol)
ScalaPlugin fileFor(sym : Symbol)
ScalaPlugin findFileFor(file : PlainFile)
```

In the last method finding takes place again **workspace** root dir. 

Hope, it will move the bug to trivial issue :-)
The replacement of the ScalaPlugin.findFileFor(file : PlainFile) shown below solves the problem for me:

```scala
    private def findFileFor(file : PlainFile) : Option[ScalaPlugin.this.File] = {
      import org.eclipse.core.runtime._
      var path = Path.fromOSString(file.path)
      val allProjects = underlying :: externalDepends.toList

      val targetProject = allProjects.find { p => plugin.javaProject(p) match {
        case None     => false
        case Some(jp) => plugin.sourceFolders(jp).find(_.getLocation.isPrefixOf(path)).isDefined
```
      targetProject match {
        case None => None
        case Some(javaProject) => projectSafe(javaProject) match {
          case None => None
          case Some(scalaProject) => 
            val relPath = path.removeFirstSegments(javaProject.getLocation.segmentCount)
            val iFile = javaProject.getFile(relPath)
            scalaProject.fileSafe(iFile)
        }
      }
    }

{code}

OTOH, this code uses plugin.sourceFolders and isn't suitable for not-source files. As I don't know anything about the method overall using, I can not be sure the code is correct at all use cases.
It seems like there are other fragments in the plugin code which silently assume projects locations are inside an Eclipse workspace. Sean, Miles, can you verify those fragments don't break anything for projects living outside the workspace?
