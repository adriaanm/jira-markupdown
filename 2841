Hmmmm... It appears unrelated to the use of the backticks. I changed it to "matching" instead of "match" with backticks and still my framework complains that the argument name is unexpected:

    def findModulesMatching(repository: String, matching: Map[String, Object]): List[Module] = { ... }

These are the parameters of the method: [repository, matching$$1]

Not sure why the compiler appended $$1 to one of the parameter names and not the other...
