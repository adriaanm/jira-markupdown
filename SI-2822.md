With: scala-2.8.0.r20246-b20091219020404 I get:
```scala
scala> val a = scala.collection.immutable.Stack(3, 4, 5)
a: scala.collection.immutable.Stack[Int] = Stack(3, 4, 5)

scala> a.reverse
res5: scala.collection.immutable.Seq[Int] = List(3, 3, 3)
```
This has two problems.  First, the "new collections for 2.8" document said that operations should return the same type of object as the input whenever feasible; it shouldn't change from Stack to List.  Second, of course, is that it's totally the wrong answer: what happened to the 4 and 5?
(In r20250) Minimally integrated the semi-orphaned immutable.Stack into
the collections hierarchy and enabled it in the sequence tests.
Closes #2822.  review by community.
