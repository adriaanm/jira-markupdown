The following code will give the error in the bug's summary if semicolons are missing
```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  """
    x
  """ contains 'x'

  """
    x
  """ contains 'x'
}
```

However, this will compile:
```scala
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  """
    x
  """ contains 'x'

  """
  """ contains 'x'
}
```
