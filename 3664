I figured this must have been changed because of issues with type equality after deserialization, and a little searching reveals SI-2214.  I had to address a similar problem with manifests which can be seen in r20079.  I don't know why @serialize + readResolve is not working with enums, but the right fix is ensuring that they deserialize to the same object.  The patch for 2214 instead of addressing the issue directly makes all enums with the same id equal, which I would say is adding a problem, not subtracting one.
