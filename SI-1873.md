*Steps to reproduce*

 1. Create a Scala project using the _New Scala Project_ wizard
 2. Go to _Configure Build Path..._
 3. Add a source folder named _src2_ to the build path
 4. Select _Allow output folders for source folders_
 5. Select the output folder of _src2_ and click the _Edit_ button on the right
 6. In the dialog that appears create a new directory _bin2_ and set it as the output folder
 7. Create a class _Class1_ under package _pack_ in the _src_ folder
 8. Create a class _Class2_ under package _pack_ in the _src2_ folder

We expect the compiled file of Class2 to be located at _bin2/pack/Class2.class_ but instead it is located at _bin/pack/Class2.class_. The directory _bin_ is the default output directory and the output directory of _src_.

If you go back to the build path settings and change the output folder of _src_ to a new directory _bin1_ then also all the files get compiled under _bin_ (the default output directory).

*Tested with*

 * Eclipse Version: 3.4.2 Build id: M20090211-1700
 * SDT version 2.8.0.r17471-b20090410021621
 * Update site: http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-nightly
 * SUN JDK 1.6
 * Ubuntu 9.04 
Duplicate of SI-1400. Currently scalac only supports a single output directory so Eclipse is unlikely to support multiple output folders until that changes ... hopefully 2.8.0.
