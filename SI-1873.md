**Steps to reproduce**

 1. Create a Scala project using the _New Scala Project_ wizard
 2. Go to _Configure Build Path..._
 3. Add a source folder named _src2_ to the build path
 4. Select _Allow output folders for source folders_
 5. Select the output folder of _src2_ and click the _Edit_ button on the right
 6. In the dialog that appears create a new directory _bin2_ and set it as the output folder
 7. Create a class _Class1_ under package _pack_ in the _src_ folder
 8. Create a class _Class2_ under package _pack_ in the _src2_ folder

We expect the compiled file of Class2 to be located at *bin2/pack/Class2.class* but instead it is located at *bin/pack/Class2.class*. The directory *bin* is the default output directory and the output directory of *src*.

If you go back to the build path settings and change the output folder of *src* to a new directory *bin1* then also all the files get compiled under *bin* (the default output directory).

**Tested with**

 * Eclipse Version: 3.4.2 Build id: M20090211-1700
 * SDT version 2.8.0.r17471-b20090410021621
 * Update site: http://www.scala-lang.org/scala-eclipse-plugin-nightly
 * SUN JDK 1.6
 * Ubuntu 9.04 
Duplicate of #1400. Currently scalac only supports a single output directory so Eclipse is unlikely to support multiple output folders until that changes ... hopefully 2.8.0.
