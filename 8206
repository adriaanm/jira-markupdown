{{TypeFlowAnalysis}} does not define any {{consumedTypes}} or {{producedTypes}} for ICode instructions. The closest it does is using one of them, in just one place, as shown next:

{noformat}
        case cm @ CALL_METHOD(_, _) =>
          stack pop cm.consumed
          cm.producedTypes foreach (stack push _)
{noformat}

I don't see why {{TypeFlowAnalysis}} should be touched at all.
