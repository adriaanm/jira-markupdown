This won't compile because the compiler says that the second case is unreachable:

{code}
null.asInstanceOf[String] match { case s: String => true; case _ => false }
{code}

This does compile:

{code}
null.asInstanceOf[String] match { case s: String if s != null => true; case _ => false }
{code}

However it doesn't work:

{code}
scala.MatchError

        at .<clinit>(<console>)
        at RequestResult$$.<init>(<console>:3)

{code}

This is semantically equivalent but returns false as expected.  (Note absence of a type declaration for "s.")

{code}
null.asInstanceOf[String] match { case s if s != null => true; case _ => false }
{code}

It appears as if Scala ignores the "if s != null" condition when there is a type declaration for s.

I know that I can just do "case null" in these simple examples, but the actual code is more complicated, and the "if s != null" construct would have been helpful, had it worked with the type declaration.
This is a duplicate of SI-1609.  I hope to fix it soon.
