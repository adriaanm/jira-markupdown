I've started to add the extension point to Importers in the last commit here: https://github.com/scala/scala/compare/scala:2.11.x...retronym:topic/ximporter-annotation-completion?expand=1

It wasn't working as I had hoped, I suspect there is an underlying bug in the compiler generating the right bridge methods down the cake for the method I added. 

Reminds me a little of aspects of scala/bug#8777.
