I think it would be better to have the test status at the right, so that the line with the test number and the test file can be printed before the test is executed. When the test is finished, the result is added at the right side.

E. g.
{code}
& starting 1347 tests in run
   1 - run/absoverride.scala                             ok
   2 - run/amp.scala                                     ok 
   3 - run/adding-growing-set.scala                      
{code}
In the above example, test 3 would be running.

In cases where a test hangs, it is extremely annoying to not immediately see on which test partest is stuck.
It would also make test failures more intuitive, because the e. g. stacktrace would come after and not before the test number/file name/test status line.

See https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2418#issuecomment-16892202
The other advantage to reporting in stable submit order (stable if you sort within the test kind, which partest doesn't do again ATM) is that you can add an option +103 to skip the first 103 tests, or whatever.

I'm doing a test clean-up (strangely interesting exercise), and it would be nice to skip what I now know to be clean.

It's like returning the next day with your tooth brush, only to find that you have to do the urinals again before moving on to the showers.
