A freebsd user found no scripts would run.

[Side note: the fact that scripts by default connect to the compilation daemon without advertising that fact means that the many network related issues we have with fsc such as blocked ports, dns not resolving, /etc/hosts being malformed, and the issue in this ticket all materialize as extremely puzzling errors in scripts.  People often have no idea the network could even be involved.  We need to make such errors more transparent.]

The scripts were hanging because of fsc and ipv6, as shown here:
```scala
$$ fsc -verbose
[Server arguments: -d /storage/home/cpj/doc/dev/2010/06/scala-hello/.
-verbose]
[VM arguments: ]
[Temp directory: /var/tmp/scala-devel/cpj]

```

User supplied -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true to the JVM and the problem went away.  We should do one of the following: fail more transparently, fail more gracefully, or not fail.
(In r24494) Accumulated work on fsc.  Cleans up a bunch of things, and
adds the following new options.

  -ipv4          Use IPv4 rather than IPv6 for the server socket
  -absolute-cp   Make classpath elements absolute paths before sending to server
  -max-idle      Set idle timeout in minutes for fsc (use 0 for no timeout)

My question marks are what are the right defaults for the first two.
Former behavior is to absolutize the classpath always and never prefer
IPv4 sockets.  I changed the default to not absolutize the classpath,
with the option if you need it; I left the system default in place for
the socket creation, but I have a feeling we should default to IPv4.
My only hesitation is that the only way to request an IPv4 socket from
java involves mutating a global system property.  (Robustness FTW.)
So for now, you have to give -ipv4.
