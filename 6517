(extempore in [r25650|https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25650]) Refine lub calculation.

When a reasonable lub cannot be arrived at by direct means,
use the bounds of the lub inputs to derive bounds for the lub
rather than giving up.  Closes scala/bug#4938, review by moors.
