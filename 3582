FYI to any interested: here is iulian's comment on SI-1456 which explains why this happens:

Indeed, constant propagation works using constant types, like Char('3'). The type of a value definition is widened to its underlying type, unless the value is declared final. I guess the clean solution would be to make the type checker assign constant types for non-final values when they are defined inside an object definition (thus being implicitly final).

However I have tried at least twice to do this (not recently) and it's not so easy.  You get a whole boatload of subtle behavioral changes by messing with it.
