Hi Lukas.  I suppose I meant there is no one size to fit all approach with this example like there is with Id, because of the bespoke attribute information required.  We need to either make do with messier code, or write a type alias for every column.  While not the end of the world, this loses some of the gain we made when switching from Java to Scala to benefit from the concise syntax.

Cheers,
