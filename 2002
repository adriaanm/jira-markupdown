I have the same problem with scala 2.8.0.Beta1 and obfuscated library:
```scala
... error: package trree contains object and package with same name: b
 one of them needs to be removed from classpath
       val sail = new com.ontotext.trree.OwlimSchemaRepository()
                                   ^
```
I am not importing the conflicting class nor package. This error breaks java interoperability. This worked with scala 2.7.7.

Why are the scala package naming/importing rules enforced on valid binary java imports, instead of being scoped only on compiled scala sources?
