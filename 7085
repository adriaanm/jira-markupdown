I would advise caution here. The collection libraries are already very large. Making them larger does not necessarily new friends us make. 25% of use cases for a semi-popular method like groupBy is for me under the threshold for an addition. 

Besides, I would really value some stability in the collection libraries. Let's spend our energy to working on I/O, concurrency, async. There's a whole world out here that needs out attention more than this.
