Scala plugin version: 2.8.0 r16764 (nightly)

Eclipse version: 3.4.0 M20080911-1700 

If error in source file is corrected then red error underline in source code editor is not always removed. (However error mark in the left bar in source editor disappears if there was one). Underline is not even removed if I try to refresh or clean project. This causes significant disturbance to someone who does know Scala well (as it hard to ignore these warnings)

Expected result:
Source code that contains no errors should be shown without error underlines. (And more precisely, recompilation should refresh error annotations in source code editor)
Oh sorry, this ticket seems to be a duplicate of #1277
