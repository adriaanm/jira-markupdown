The nightly build for months warns about "only one @since tag is allowed" because a trait will define it and a class will inherit it and define their own.  If only one is allowed, why would the right "since" value ever be anything but the concrete class? "Foo" has existed since "Foo" came to exist: when "TraitFooMixesIn" was written doesn't enter into it.

I tried to fix this but it looks like there's no facility for not inheriting tags, and I wasn't yet up for writing one.
(In r24676) Every tag element (even @define and @usecase) end before the next recognised tag. Closes SI-4409. Review by extempore.
