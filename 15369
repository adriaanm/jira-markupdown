This case should work.  Forwarder logic is trying to avoid conflicts which don't exist.
```scala
class Foo

object Foo extends Foo {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    
  }
}
```
```scala
scala Foo
java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: Foo.main([Ljava.lang.String;)
```

I'll fix it if nobody else gets to it first.
