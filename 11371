As far as I see, `@Deprecated` being added to the `RuntimeVisibleAttribute` is just because it is defined with `RetentionPolicy` `RUNTIME`, but `ACC_DEPRECATED` is the only thing that counts semantically.

From the declaration of `@deprecated` it is just a "source annotation". I wouldn't bother introducing another special case, especially because the attribute really just records whether "annotation X was here" and doesn't carry any semantic meaning.

If we want `@deprecated` to show up, we should make it extend the appropriate Annotation type in Scala.

Whether we'd like to support `@Deprecated` is an interesting question.

By the way, maybe we can just type alias `@Deprecated` to `@deprecated` in Scala? That might be a much simpler approach.
