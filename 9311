I just did that thing where you stare at two identical pieces of test code, identical except that one issues "inferred existential type" at the first line.
{code}
      val ref = new SimpleSpec with Reference with Property {
        type ThisCommandLine = SpecCommandLine
        protected def creator(args: List[String]): ThisCommandLine = new SpecCommandLine(args) 
        //def referenceSpec: Reference = this    // perniciously, the type is required
        def referenceSpec = this                 // not even used, could be ??? here
        override def propMapper = new PropertyMapper(this)
      }
{code}
