I'm using r16383.
{code}
  ~/newbug> cat J.java
class J { static {
	scala.List<?> x = null;

perhaps this is related to SI-1186, I don't know.



sorry, I should have been more clear. I am reporting this bug against the trunk â€” not against the 2.7.2 branch.
I just checked and the bug still exists on the trunk as of r16402, so I am reopening.


confirmed, RC4 is fine:
{code}
  ~/scala> cat J.java
class J { static {
	scala.List<?> x = null;
} }
  ~/scala> javac -classpath /usr/local/scala-2.7.2.RC4/lib/scala-library.jar J.java
{code}


reopening because the bug is now occurring in 2.7.2.RC5

:-(
