Here's a more ambitious version, that removes access widening from {{SuperAccessors}} altogether.

  https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/2.10.0-wip...ticket/6562-3

I suspect there are subtle issues with binary compatibility if we defer this change to 2.10.1. The assumptions that we have encoded into {{Inliners}} about what happened earlier in {{ExplicitOuter}} only hold if the inlinable method and the call site are compiled with the same version of the compiler.

Perhaps we could harden things by validating those assumptions (checking the Java types), or offering the improvements behind a -Y option for use only by people with homogenenously compiled libraries.
