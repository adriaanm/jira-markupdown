Defining new refined instances of an abstract case class with equal parameter values, the instances are equal, but their hashCodes are not. This seems against the spec.

scala> abstract case class C(id: String)
scala> val A1 = new C("A") {}
scala> val A2 = new C("A") {}

scala> A1 == A2
res1: Boolean = true

scala> A1.hashCode == A2.hashCode
res2: Boolean = **false**
