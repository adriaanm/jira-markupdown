Since there's work going on with Stream at the moment anyway, might this be a good time to fix this on trunk (even if it doesn't make it into 2.8.0)?

I've appended a patch with a proposed solution (passes {{ant test}} on top of current r22157).

It replaces Stream.Cons by

{code}
  @serializable @SerialVersionUID(2734764611255889683L)
  final class Cons[+A](hd: A, tl: => Stream[A]) extends Stream[A] {
    override def isEmpty = false
    override val head = hd
    def tailDefined = tailDefinedVar
    @volatile private var tailDefinedVar = false
    override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = {
      tailDefinedVar = true
      tl
    }
  }
{code}

I regenerated the serial version UID, since this will be incompatible with the old one, right?
