Hi Lukas.

I have finished upgrading our annotations and all is working.  Unfortunately an old ticket has re-surfaced and is causing us problems: scala/bug#2357.

We have a variable as per:
```scala
@Column(name="ISO_CODE", nullable=false, length=4)
@BeanProperty var isoCode: String = _
```

We get an error complaining about 'oCode', looks like the same problem as before.

Cheers,

Ross
