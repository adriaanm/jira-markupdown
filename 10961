The way I expect it to work is following:

1. User calls f interpolator with heterogeneous arguments:
{code}
StringContext(...).f(1, 2.0, 'three)
{code}
2. Typer infers useless type for T
{code}
StringContext(...).f[Any](1, 2.0, 'three)
{code}
3. Macro comes and inspects .tpe of the arguments completely disregarding inferred T. 

This way tpes should get attributed with proper concrete types rather than Any. I don't expect any problems wrt heterogeneous arguments.
