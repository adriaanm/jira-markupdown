That stack trace looks like a side-effect of an earlier failure when the New Scala object dialog was first opened. Are there any relevant looking entries showing up in the Eclipse Error Log view?

Independently of that, could you run through the troubleshooting section [http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94 here] and let me know how you get on.
