## What steps will reproduce the problem?
Look at some code, most probably it will have something like ``foo'` in the comments. This breaks formatting, because ScalaDoc2 only fully supports ``foo``

## What is the expected behavior?
Fix the comments.

## What do you see instead?
Code using the legacy quotes.
I've merged. But I can't commit the below file. Could you commit scaladoc-json.diff or change the permission of the repository?

```
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: access to '/svn-repos/scala/!svn/ver/24766/scala/trunk/src/library/scala/util/parsing/json/JSON.scala' forbidden
```
(kzys in [r25255](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25255)) Fixes some remaining formatting issues. Related to #4490. Contributed by Simon Ochsenreither. Review by ureche.
