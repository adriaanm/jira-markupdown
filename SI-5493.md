before commit c800d1fec5241ed8c29e5af30465856f9b583246 the following gave a type error (correctly)

```scala
object Test {
  def meh(xs: Any): Any = xs :: iDontExist :: Nil
}
```

that commit causes the type error to be ignored, and failure is delayed until superaccessors (type error reporting is restored if you don't use methods that end in ':')

```scala
[adriaan@lampmac13 scala ((c800d1f...))]$ qsc /Users/adriaan/Desktop/typercrash.scala  -Xprint:typer
[[syntax trees at end of typer]]// Scala source: typercrash.scala
package <empty> {
  final object Test extends Object with ScalaObject {
    def <init>(): object Test = {
      Test.super.<init>();
      ()
    };
    def meh(xs: Any): Any = {
      <synthetic> val x$2: Any = xs;
      {
  <synthetic> val x$1: <error> = <error>;
  Nil.$colon$colon(x$1)
}.$colon$colon(x$2)
    }
  }
}
```

i suspect it has something to do with the rewrite we do for methods that end in ':' (see makeBinop, I think)
