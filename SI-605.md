The interpreter admits the subject line as input, but it shouldn't.  The reason is because the following code compiles:
```scala
  object Foo {
    println "Hello, world"
  }
```
Either this should not compile, or the interpreter needs to insert something at the beginning of its object wrappers to avoid this trap.  I am not sure why it compiles, though.  It compiles equivalently to this:
```scala
  object Foo {
    println ; "Hello, world"
  }
```
Is that intentional, or is the parser getting confused when it thinks "println" might be a this alias for the template?
It is actually already `println(): Unit` (at least in trunk).  In any event, whether or not the parens are given does not affect how it may be called.

In any event, with 2.7.0 final the interpreter does not accept the subject line:
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.0-final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.5.0_14).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> println "Hello, world"
error: That kind of statement combination is not supported by the interpreter.

scala>
```
and
```scala
% echo 'println "Hello, world"' > hello.scala
% scala hello.scala
(fragment of hello.scala):1: error: ';' expected but string literal found.
println "Hello, world"
         ^
one error found
!!!
discarding <script preamble>
```
To replicate the "object Foo" version, simply compile the object and observe that the compilation succeeds.  To replicate the interpreter version, you need to build from trunk instead of using 2.7.0-final.  You will see that it also compiles.  Then look at the script version you tried, and observe that it does NOT compile.  Further, you will also see that it fails to compile for the object Foo and the interpreter versions if you add parentheses around the expression.  Why such inconsistency about such a simple expression?

I think that the expression should fail to parse in all of these contexts.  If the language lawyers disagree, and there is a reason the expression should work, then the interpreter needs to be updated, perhaps by adding a semicolon at the beginning of the object wrapper it makes:
```scala
  object Foo { ;
    println "Hello, world"
  }
```

Before this issue is closed, one of the two should happen: the expression should be rejected in all contexts, or the interpreter should be updated.

To give some context, this matters because the expression in the subject line is one of the first things people try when they download Scala.  It would be good if the Scala tools give sensible output to this common input.
