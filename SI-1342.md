This breaks java compatibility. Here is a simple example :

I have a java interface defined as follow :

```scala
interface JavaVarArgsInterface {
   void varArgsMethod( String ... args );
}
```

I want to implement it in scala now :

```scala
class ScalaVarArgsImpl extends JavaVarArgsInterface {
   def varArgsMethod( args : String*) {
        for( arg <- args ) println( arg )
   }
}
```

The compilation will pass but will generate the following class :

```scala
public class ScalaVarArgsImpl extends java.lang.Object implements JavaVarArgsInterface,scala.ScalaObject{
    public ScalaVarArgsImpl();
    public void varArgsMethod(scala.Seq);
    public int $$tag()       throws java.rmi.RemoteException;
}
```

Which obviously doesn't implement properly the JavaArgsInterface.

With 2.7.1-final we would do the following :

```scala
class ScalaVarArgsImpl extends JavaVarArgsInterface {
   def varArgsMethod( args : Array[String]) {
        for( arg <- args ) println( arg )
   }
}
```

And it would compile as expected.

If you compile this with 2.7.2-final you'll get :

```scala
ScalaVarArgsImpl.scala:1: error: class ScalaVarArgsImpl needs to be abstract, since method varArgsMethod in trait JavaVarArgsInterface of type (java.lang.String*)Unit is not defined
class ScalaVarArgsImpl extends JavaVarArgsInterface {
      ^
one error found
```

Just had a better look at the printout for 2.8.0: varArgsMethod appears two times!!

1: member=method varArgsMethod member.isDeferred=false !(clazz hasFlag ABSTRACT)=true !isAbstractTypeWithoutFBound(member)=true (member hasFlag JAVA)=false (javaErasedOverridingSym(member) != NoSymbol?)=false !((member hasFlag JAVA) && (javaErasedOverridingSym(member) != NoSymbol?))=true

2: member=method varArgsMethod member.isDeferred=true !(clazz hasFlag ABSTRACT)=true !isAbstractTypeWithoutFBound(member)=true (member hasFlag JAVA)=true (javaErasedOverridingSym(member) != NoSymbol?)=false !((member hasFlag JAVA) && (javaErasedOverridingSym(member) != NoSymbol?))=true

(1) is coincident with the output from 2.7.6 and it seems to represent the method from ScalaVarArgsImpl?.scala

(2) seems to describe the abstract method from JavaVarArgsInterface?.java

How does the latter get into clazz.tpe.nonPrivateMembers ?
This will be an absolute pain to implement, I am afraid. Scala varargs are Seqs and arrays are not Seqs so I see no way to do this directly. IMO the only way to do it is to add a case for this into the generation of bridge methods in erasure, I'd be delighted if someone else did it, though. 

I am afraid that would amount to shooting the messenger. That test is there for a reason. Without it you'd get an AbstractMethodError at runtime. I'm working on a solution which involves creating bridge methods between these different views.
First, I want to thank you for implementing this feature!

I tried it already and it worked fine in my first test case. But there's still an open issue. Consider the following classes:

 * ScalaSeqInterface.java
```scala
public interface ScalaSeqInterface {
  public String f(String... seq);
}
```
 * ScalaSeq.scala
```scala
class ScalaSeq extends ScalaSeqInterface {
  def f(seq: String*): String = "asdf"
}
```
 * ScalaSeqTest.java
```scala
public class ScalaSeqTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(((ScalaSeqInterface) new ScalaSeq()).f(""));  // compiles
    System.out.println(new ScalaSeq().f(""));                        // does not compile
  }
}
```

Why can't I use `new ScalaSeq().f("")` in a Java class? Why do I have to cast the Scala class first?

PS: But since there's a workaround (via casting) for this problem, there might be more urgent issues at the moment.
