I came across a strange behavior of Scala compiler regarding a rather exotic case described bellow. It seems to be a bug as I wouldn't expect, as a Scala newbie, raising a compile error.

Consider the following trait (being it a class does not make any difference):

```scala
trait P[T] {
    class Inner(val f: T => Unit = _ => println("nope"))
}
```

The following code works as one would expect:

```scala
scala> val p = new P[Int] {
     |     val inner = new Inner
     | }
p: java.lang.Object with P[Int]{def inner: this.Inner} = $$anon$$1@12192a9

scala> p.inner.f(5)
nope
```

But as soon as I wanted to extend P.Inner inside P's definition, the following error was raised:

```scala
scala> val p = new P[Int] {
     |     val inner = new Inner() {
     |         println("some primary constructor code in here")
     |     }
     | }
<console>:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : (T) => Unit
 required: (Int) => Unit
           val inner = new Inner() {
                           ^
```

Leaving out parenthesis after new Inner makes no difference. Providing an (Int) => Unit function literal instead works just fine.

Please follow, if need be, Stack Overflow question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2503186/default-type-parametrized-function-literal-class-parameter I have raised initially (for I was not sure it is a bug) as there may come more detail by other SO users.
