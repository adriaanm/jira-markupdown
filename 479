I just did a quick test. If this is scala.xml.XML that you are using, this one works for me.
```scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.7.0-final (Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM, Java 1.6.0_05-ea).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.

scala> scala.xml.XML.load(new java.io.StringReader("<test2 s=\"a&amp;\"></test2>"))
res0: scala.xml.Elem = <test2 s="a&amp;"></test2>
```
