scala> def foo() = { println("foo") ; 5 }
foo: ()Int

scala> class C { def m1(f: => Int) = () ; def m2_:(f: => Int) = () }
defined class C

scala> val c = new C
c: C = C@96d484

scala> c m1 foo()

scala> foo() m2_: c
foo

But it is not evaluated if invoked directly:
{code}
scala> c.m2_:(foo())

scala>
{code}
sorry the formatting was wrong:

{code}
scala> object D { def ?: [T](block: => T) = { println("In D"); block } }
defined module D

scala> foo() ?: D                                                       
foo
In D
res5: Int = 5

scala> D.?:(foo())                                                      
In D
foo
res6: Int = 5
{code}
The problem here is that, to maintain left-to-right evaluation semantics, the parser will pre-calculate the argument of `m2_:` (`foo`). In other words, a call like `foo() m2_: c` will be parsed as:
{code}
{
  <synthetic> val x$$1 = foo;
  c.m2_$$colon(x$$1)
};
{code}

Obviously, this compilation scheme forces the evaluation of `foo`, before it is used in the body of `m2_:` (and if at all).

Fixing this isn't trivial: During parsing, when the expansion described above is triggered, there is no symbol information. Therefore, the type of the argument of `m2_:` is unknown. This makes it impossible to use a special parsing scheme for by-name parameters (i.e. do not pre-calculate the value). The colon-inverting logic would have to happen later, at least after the namer has run, which is rather unpleasant to do.
> The problem here is that, to maintain left-to-right evaluation semantics

My first thought is that for right-associative operators (i.e. operators ending in a colon ‘:’), right-to-left evaluation makes more sense:-

For
{code}
    lazy val three: Int = { println("three"); 3 }
    lazy val nil: List[Int] = { println("nil"); Nil }

    three :: nil
{code}
the output could sanely be
{code}
nil
three
{code}
instead of the current
{code}
three
nil
{code}

I expect this avoids the parser complications.

The spec would change from

{code}
A left-associative binary operation e1 op e2 is interpreted
as e1.op(e2). If op is right associative, the same operation
is interpreted as { val x=e1; e2.op(x ) }, where x is a
fresh name.
{code}
to the simpler
{code}
A left-associative binary operation e1 op e2 is interpreted
as e1.op(e2). If op is right associative, the same operation
is interpreted as e2.op(e1)
{code}

See also SI-4773 which is more about the inference, but it seems both inference and the incorrect evaluation aspect could be achieved with the desugaring proposed in both tickets.
I apparently failed to update this ticket when I tried this out and found the real deal killer.
{code}
scala> val nextid = { var x = 1 ; () => try "x" + x finally x += 1 }
nextid: () => String = <function0>

scala> nextid() #:: nextid() #:: nextid() #:: Stream[String]()
res0: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[String] = Stream(x1, ?)

scala> res1.toList
res1: List[String] = List(x1, x2, x3)
{code}
If this evaluates right to left you get List(x3, x2, x1), and because whether an argument is by-name or not is not visible at the call site, you always have to worry about it.

Another type inference implication: dependent types from SI-4518.

{code}
class Broke {

  val tempval = new AnyRef {val roleA = new AnyRef with Bar}.roleA

  new AnyRef {} -: tempval // when not assigning to anything, no problem
  val broke_val = new AnyRef {} -: tempval // type mismatch error only when assigning

  trait Foo[AnyRef] {  }

  trait Bar extends Foo[AnyRef] {
    def -:(core: AnyRef): this.type with Foo[core.type] = throw new Exception()
  }
}
{code}
A good suggestion from the mailing list:

Anyway, this is really counterintuitive and effectively means that by-name parameters make no sense with right-associative operators. I think it would be nice if the compiler at least issued a warning about this.

SLS 4.6.1 says that call-by-name argument "is not evaluated at the point of function application, but instead is evaluated at each use within the function".

So as for me, current behavior is clearly against the spec.

But 6.12.3 offers:

"If op is right- associative, the same operation is interpreted as { val x=e1; e2.op(x ) }, where x is a fresh name."
