In r20833, with this code:
```scala
object A {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("a")
  }
}
```

Hitting Ctrl-F11 brings up an Eclipse dialog for selecting either A or A$$ to run.

Ironically, this is probably a by-product of your Java integration working too well and both A and A$$ having the static methods presented to the Java side of Eclipse.

Selecting either seems to work, but it would be nice to avoid the extra dialog/return and have Eclipse just know that "A$$" is correct.

Wasn't sure whether to report this or not as it's pretty minor.
