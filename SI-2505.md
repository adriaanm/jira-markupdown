The error was reproduced with scala 2.8.0.r18462-b20090811081019 and 2.7.5 at least.
the following code reproduces it.

scala> class Parameter {
   def this(value:Double) = {
       this()
   }

   def this(p:String) = {
       this(try{
               java.lang.Double.parseDouble( p )
           } catch {
               case _ => null.asInstanceOf[Double]
           }
       )
   }
}

scala> new pt.cnbc.wikimodels.dataModel.Parameter("10.1")

After experimenting with changes in the code I determined that the following conditions are required to reproduce the bug:
 - There has to be a class with two constructors of different types (the number of arguments doesn't have to be the same even).
 - one constructor must call the other
 - the calling of the second constructor inside the
first has to have a try... catch block in the parameter (an if..else block does not work).

Apparently, the compiler does not acknowledge the the try ... catch
block has a 'Double' type and then calls the wrong constructor.

In attach goes a maven project with the code and a test of needed.
