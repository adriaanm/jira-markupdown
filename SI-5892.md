Views should not be allowed when typing the arguments of annotations.

This is one way the problem manifests:

This isn't so rosy, either:

{code}
scala> @foo({println("foo"); ""}) def blerg {}
blerg: Unit
{code}
Oh well, it's a {{StaticAnnotation}}, so maybe it's not a problem.
I agree, that's what I meant in the previous comment.

We just have to prevent cyclic inheritance. I haven't extracted a small test case to demonstrate this yet, but you can see it with this branch of Scalala [1]. This is raised as a type error, and not caught by the {{isCyclicOrErroneous}} check in implicit search. 

But the root problem seems to be incorrect scoping -- {{b2s}} should not be in {{implicitss}} when typing the annotation in this example:

{code}
class annot(a: String) extends StaticAnnotation
class A[@annot(false) X] {
  implicit def b2s(b: Boolean): String = ""
}
{code}

I tried to set {{Context#isSelfSuperCall}} [2] when typing class type parameters to achieve this, but the annotation was typed with a different context, that of the typer in Namers.
