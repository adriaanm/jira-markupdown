A simple execution of {{baseClasses}} indicates it return things that are not classes:

{code}
scala> reflect.runtime.universe.typeOf[String].baseClasses foreach println
class String
trait CharSequence
trait Comparable
trait Serializable
class Object
class Any
{code}

(as a side note, I'd rather it returned {{AnyRef}} than {{Object}})

I understand that, since the return type is {List[Symbol]}, calling it {{baseTypes}} would be misleading, but {{Symbol}} is not a {{Class}} either, and {{trait}} is definitely something I wouldn't expect to be listed on a method called {{baseClasses}}.

Those are all classes. Traits are classes, Any is a class. It isn't going to return AnyRef because that is not a class, it's a type alias.  And symbols do represent classes.  So all in all I can't find anything to agree with here, except the upcoming observation that this is likely to confuse people.
