Turns out that there was confusion around `-Dlocker.skip` and [{{starr.number}}](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.x/starr.number). For the record, the `starr.number` is not being used by the build as noted in this commit: https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/88b7a7241484657f77e38d8f788255966f14c709

Once proper (2.10.1) starr was used this issue disappeared.
