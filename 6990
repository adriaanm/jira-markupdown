The decision to use the upper bits on `HashTable` came from this commit:
```scala

    Changed hash code strategy in hash table - now taking most significant bits when transforming the hash code into an index.
```

And `HashTable` also has an explanation of why:
```scala
  // Note:                                                                                                      
  // we take the most significant bits of the hashcode, not the lower ones                                      
  // this is of crucial importance when populating the table in parallel   
```

I'm surprised `mutable.HashTable` is used at all on the parallel collections.
