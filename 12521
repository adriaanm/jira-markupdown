I took a look the other day and wasn't sure how the expansion should proceed.
```scala
A(5) = A(5) + 42
A(5)(ev) = A(5)(ev) + 42
A.apply(5).update(ev, A(5)(ev) + 42)
```

The `apply(5)` seems to be elided when it should error; I'm just reading off the scrap of paper, too beset with the ague to think about it.
