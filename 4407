(In r24494) Accumulated work on fsc.  Cleans up a bunch of things, and
adds the following new options.

  -ipv4          Use IPv4 rather than IPv6 for the server socket
  -absolute-cp   Make classpath elements absolute paths before sending to server
  -max-idle      Set idle timeout in minutes for fsc (use 0 for no timeout)

My question marks are what are the right defaults for the first two.
Former behavior is to absolutize the classpath always and never prefer
IPv4 sockets.  I changed the default to not absolutize the classpath,
with the option if you need it; I left the system default in place for
the socket creation, but I have a feeling we should default to IPv4.
My only hesitation is that the only way to request an IPv4 socket from
java involves mutating a global system property.  (Robustness FTW.)
So for now, you have to give -ipv4.
