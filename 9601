This particular bug isn't directly connected to Swing, BTW.

From my pull-request comment:

This bug is often reported by Java 7 Swing users but is unrelated to scala-swing, raw types, or newly-generified Java standard library classes. It could pop up anytime. It is also usually only seen within SBT when its custom compiler phase captures API snapshots.

Given our limited resources, we typically don't backport bug fixes to maintainance releases unless they are deemed showstoppers, or if it needed by a customer with a Typesafe support contract. PIng me at jason.zaugg@typesafe.com if the latter is a possibility for you.
