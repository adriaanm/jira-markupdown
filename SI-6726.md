I am having problems with 2.10-RC2 for this match

Code: https://gist.github.com/8995c2131c5d3e49c629

It compiles fine with 2.9.2.
On eclipse I get a StackOverflow error that suggests me to close the workbench.
On the command line output the compiler shows an error during phase patmat (scala.tools.nsc.typechecker.PatternMatching$Logic$And.equals)

Output: https://gist.github.com/ae82deae3b906a8e8b89

Paul Phillips figured out the problem: the 324 case was there twice. However the compiler should not crash because of this. But it should not compile (also a bug in 2.9.x I guess).
I hit this long time ago but I couldn't minimize it on my code (I think I sent stacktrace to you, Adriaan, but without the code so it was useless). 
So now I experimented a bit and here is pretty dummy generator for the example:
```scala
object bugGenerator {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("trait Foo{")
    println("abstract class Base")
    val max = 2000
    for (x <- Range(0, max)) println("case class Dummy" + x + "(x: Int) extends Base")
    println("def test(y: Base) = y match {")
    for (x <- Range(0, max)) println(" case Dummy" + x + "(p) => p")
    println("}\n}")
  }
}
```

starts crashing somewhere between 1000 and 2000, even with "-Dscalac.patmat.analysisBudget=off" (apart from the fact that it takes long to compile).
Likely related to #6942, I'm checking if this works after the recent patch.
I've done a little profiling and tuning over here:

assigning to Jason since he did the work on tuning

this bug can be closed once his PR is merged -- the SAT4j migration is logged as #6582
