It is somewhat embarrassing how many times Stream has stopped working in one way or another.  (I am not pointing fingers, I can write tests as capably as anyone else.) This is the most basic of functionality.  Sometime since Beta1 map and flatMap stopped terminating.
```scala
scala> Stream from 1 map (x => x)
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
	at scala.collection.immutable.Stream.map(Stream.scala:137)
	at scala.collection.immutable.Stream$$$$anonfun$$map$$1.apply(Stream.scala:137)
	at scala.collection.immutable.Stream$$$$anonfun$$map$$1.apply(Stream.scala:137)
```
