The following compiles under 2.8 final but throws a VerifyError when instantiated.
```scala
class Test {
  def this(un: Int) = {
    this()
    def test(xs: List[Int]) = xs map (x => x)
    ()
  }                                                                              
}
```
```scala
java.lang.VerifyError: (
  class: Test, method: test$$1 
  signature: (Lscala/collection/immutable/List;)Lscala/collection/immutable/List;)
Incompatible argument to function  
```
