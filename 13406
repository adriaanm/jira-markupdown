As per http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627 , a JSON value is allowed to be various things. In particular it is not just an array or an object, which is all the current JSON parsing implementation allows at the outer level. The parser should correctly deal with top level instances of numbers, booleans, etc.
