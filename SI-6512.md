We should have a way to say that all members in a trait have a certain group instead of manually tagging each. And we should be able to override the inherited members' groups in a single command:

```scala
/** @membersgroup Members 
 *  @inheritgroup InheritedMembers
 */
trait T extends ... with ... with ... {
  // many members here ...
}
```
