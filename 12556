[~ichoran], [~retronym], the same {{improve}} method with division instead of bit mask appears in other places also, e.g. https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/3cc99d7b4aa43b1b06cc837a55665896993235fc/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/FlatHashTable.scala#L428-L428

Also https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/460fa9d2af7ac12d5c6b0b935a02db30dc5d7cd8/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashMap.scala#L83-L83 and https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/cb1a4524d2b34605232afa083dd43f0b7d39b7a7/src/library/scala/collection/immutable/HashSet.scala#L180-L180 have a different hashing algorithm, mentioned in https://github.com/paplorinc/scala/blob/1ae160037b1d2b603a20595caa44ad2ce3b8dcd6/src/library/scala/collection/mutable/HashTable.scala#L455-L455 as "quick, but bad for sequence 0-10000 - little entropy in higher bits".

Is this ok, or should I open an issue for it?
