well said, sir. the mood of the moment deluded me into thinking 
{
  case `self` => true
  ...
  case _ => false
}

would *not* lead to infinite recursion. But, regarding alternatives to the use-case at hand, writing ...
{
  case x if (x eq self) => true
  ...
  case _ => false
}
seems ok, too.

Never mind, I'll look into it.
