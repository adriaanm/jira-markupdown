It would be nice if
{code}
f"hello, world"  // scala.this.Predef.augmentString("hi").format()
{code}
produced just a constant string.

That enables
{code}
f"$$ordinary"  // no cost
"$ordinary"     // looks like missing interpolator
f"$$ordinary%n"  // requires format, though could be improved
{code}

Locale is never used in rendering FixedString text.

But `f` just emits "hi".format() and the enhancement could be diverted:

{code}
package goodbye

import Predef.{ augmentString => _ }

object Test extends App {

  implicit class `bold format`(s: String) {
    def format(args: Any*): String = {
      Predef require args.isEmpty
      "goodbye, everybody"
    }
  }

  Console println f"hello, world"
}
{code}
It's not obvious that this is sipped behavior.  Someone wanting a special format could subvert the interpolator directly.
