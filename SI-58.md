nsc has two components that both deal with pattern match translation that differ in their internal representation (irep) and thus in the algorithm.
 * !PatternMatchers.scala (uses a mutable binary tree as irep)
 * !ParallelMatching.scala (uses an immutable matrix as irep)

This enhancement ticket indicates progress on fully replacing "!PatternMatchers", so future maintenance. At the time of writing, migration has progressed such that 
currently, "!PatternMatchers" is only used as a fallback, when a SequencePattern is encountered.
