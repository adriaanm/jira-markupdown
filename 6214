bq. there is no type T* even as an internal fiction

Not sure what you mean by that, but the compiler represents `T*` internally as <repeated>[T], i.e. as an `AppliedType`.

Of course the implementation is not part of the specification, but it's certainly one reference point in the cases where the specification is incomplete.
