I just ran into this bug too, working with classloaders.  Interestingly it does not manifest if you explicitly qualify with super.  Change trait S to this:
{code}
  def bar() {
    super.foo()
  }
{code}
and scala s.Test says "J.foo()".  The bytecode looks like this, as a result of the mangling in SuperAccessors.  Perhaps this is as simple as identifying this situation during that phase and treating it like a super invocation?
{code}
public static void bar(s.S);
  Code:
   0:	aload_0
   1:	invokeinterface	SI-16,  1; //InterfaceMethod s/S.s$$S$$$$super$$foo:()V
   6:	return
{code}
