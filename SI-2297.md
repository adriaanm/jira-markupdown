HTML gererated by scaladoc tool is broken as XHML.

I guessed there is two causes.

1. Several Class/Method documentation automatically inserted by scala.tools.nsc.doc.ModelAdditions has not closed tag.
Or it is illegal format as javadoc.
For example,p tag must not contain @param,@return.

2. Several library documentation has not closed tag.
Or It doesn't escape in the XML Entity reference. like '&' to '&amp;'

I downloaded scala-2.7.2-final sources and fixed documentation.
and created patch.

attach file :fix_scaladoc.patch

I wish next version will import my patch.
and I wish scala adocumentaion will keep clean as XHTML.
