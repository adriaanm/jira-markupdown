I notice this now compiles in trunk, but the parameters still come back in the right order.  Thanks to git bisect I discovered the commit which partially fixed this was r16341.
{code}
scala> case class Test(private val a:String,b:Option[String])              
defined class Test

scala> Test("a", Some("b"))
res0: Test = Test(Some(b),a)
{code}
