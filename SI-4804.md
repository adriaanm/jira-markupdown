In the following code, adding @SerialVersionUID to the class results in the static forwarders missing from the byte code. 

{code}object WithoutUID {
 val instance = new WithoutUID
}
class WithoutUID extends scala.Serializable

object WithUID {
 val instance = new WithUID
}
@SerialVersionUID(0) 
class WithUID extends scala.Serializable{code}

Here is the relevant decompiled byte code:

{code}public class WithoutUID implements Serializable, ScalaObject {
  public static final WithoutUID instance(){
    return WithoutUID.MODULE$.instance();
  }
}

public class WithUID implements Serializable, ScalaObject {
  public static final long serialVersionUID = 0L;
}{code}
Huh.  I am initially mystified.
`GenJVM` has the following guard whose then-branch gets to run for both the module-symbol (because of the first or'ed expression) and also for its companion class (because of the 2nd). 

Looks like the intention was to have `addStaticInit()` executed (because `GenJVM` intializes the `serialVersionUID` static field in the `<clinit>()` added by `addStaticInit()` ). That gets done. However by not taking the else-branch for the companion class, `addForwarders()` doesn't get a chance to run.

The `GenASM` control-flow is different but also gets tripped by this bug. I'll try to adapt the fix from `GenASM` to  `GenJVM`. But the solutions are actually independent (ie, if you're familiar with `GenJVM`, your help is welcome).

```
      if (isStaticModule(c.symbol) || serialVUID != None || isParcelableClass) {
        if (isStaticModule(c.symbol))
          addModuleInstanceField
        addStaticInit(jclass, c.lookupStaticCtor)

        if (isTopLevelModule(c.symbol)) {
          if (c.symbol.companionClass == NoSymbol)
            generateMirrorClass(c.symbol, c.cunit.source)
          else
            log("No mirror class for module with linked class: " +
                c.symbol.fullName)
        }
      }
      else {
```
A {{GenASM}}-based candidate solution can be found at https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/654 

The corresponding `GenJVM` fix would look almost identical, provided fjbg could emit a static field along with its initial value (otherwise, all sorts of control-flow contortions are needed).

A question for @dragos: is it really the case that fjbg can't emit the initial value of a static field?
The ASM way to emit a field optionally expects a `value` as shown below.

```
    public FieldVisitor visitField(
        int access,
        String name,
        String desc,
        String signature,
        Object value)
```

GenASM does just that (well, in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/654 ) for `serialVersionUID` fields, thus no instructions are required for that in `clinit`.

First time I hear about fjbg's `JConstantValueAttribute`, thanks for the pointer.

This bug has been fixed for GenASM in [5cd82554069508af769d59f9e41af36f6524b4cc ](https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/5cd82554069508af769d59f9e41af36f6524b4cc), leaving open for the eventual fix for GenJVM.
