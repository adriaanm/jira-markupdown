Where's a good place to discuss a slightly higher-level group of related changes to the form of specification?  


(I'd like to have an HTML specification that has references to non-terminals linked to definitions of the terminals, so that it's easy to traverse to the definition, and, or course, I'd like to have a specification whose syntax summary matches the syntax defined in the body of the specification.

Getting there presumably involves creating some little utilities that at least checks for missing links and inconsistencies, but maybe inserts missing links too.

Creating such tools *might* push for switching to a slightly different EBNF syntax. (The current one doesn't have a token terminating each production, so it's not clear how to recognize the end of one production and the beginning of the next (at least without looking ahead for the "{{::=}}").))


Is there a good mailing list for discussing the pieces of that improvement?  Or should I file a Jira report for the group and maybe sub-reports for the supporting pieces? Or something else?
