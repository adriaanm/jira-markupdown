The "force" parameter of the scalac ant task is broken. We have received two reports from users about this bug, as follows:

--

scalac parameter description error: force="always" does not work, but force="yes" does.
"Whether to force the compilation of all files; possible values are never (only compile modified files), changed (compile all files when at least one file is modified) and always (always recompile all files); defaults to never."

I discovered that the attribute 'force' of the target 'scalac' don't
work according to the documentation found on the Scala web page
( http://www.scala-lang.org/node/98 ).
If you watch the source code of the target
'scalac' ( http://lampsvn.epfl.ch/svn-repos/scala/scala/trunk/src/compiler/scala/tools/ant/Scalac.scala ), you find that the attribute 'force' corresponds to a Boolean value. Consequently, the value 'never', 'changed' and 'always' for force are ignored and the default value is used, i.e. 'false'.
To sum up, force="false" corresponds to force="never" (only compile
modified files) and force="true" to force="always" (always recompile all
files).
