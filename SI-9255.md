This code compiles without an error even though it should fail due to compileTimeOnly:
```scala
trait T1 {
  @compileTimeOnly("oops!") def foo = 42
}
trait T2 extends T1 {
  def bar = super.foo
}
```
Not sure what to do here. The thing is that super.foo doesn't bind statically, so when compiling this code we don't know in advance whether it's going to call into a compileTimeOnly method or not.

One idea would be to introduce an additional check in the backend, but it looks like even if we can figure out statically that T1.foo is going to be called, the binding is still dynamic, so it's definitely not easy:

```scala
trait T1 {
  @scala.annotation.compileTimeOnly("oops!") def foo = 3
}
trait T2 extends T1 {
  def bar = super.foo
}
final class C extends T2

    def bar(): Int

  final class C extends Object with T2 {

    def bar(): Int = T2$class.bar(C.this);
    @scala.annotation.compileTimeOnly("oops!") def foo(): Int = T1$class.foo(C.this);
    def <init>(): C = {
      C.super.<init>();
      T1$class./*T1$class*/$init$(C.this);
      T2$class./*T2$class*/$init$(C.this);
      ()
    }
  };
  abstract trait T1$class extends  {
    @scala.annotation.compileTimeOnly("oops!") def foo($this: T1): Int = 3;
    def /*T1$class*/$init$($this: T1): Unit = {
      ()
    }
  };
  abstract trait T2$class extends  {
    def bar($this: T2): Int = $this.super$foo();
    def /*T2$class*/$init$($this: T2): Unit = {
      ()
    }
  }
}
```

In principle, we can hack up something by going through all ClassDefs, checking their super$xxx methods, computing their targets and, if they are static, verifying that they don't end up being compileTimeOnly, but I'm not sure how/whether that could be done. @retronym, what do you think?

P.S. Changing super.foo into super[T1].foo works as you expected.
