The DPLL procedure used in the pattern matcher is the bottleneck of the exhaustivity check. Replacing that algorithm with a faster one should speed up the exhaustivity check.
Based on the original DPLL algorithm, modern conflict-driven clause learning solvers (aka SAT solvers) can handle much larger problems. A possible Java implementation (based on the popular MiniSat solver) is SAT4j, see http://www.sat4j.org/

I've done the necessary changes here:  
https://github.com/gbasler/scala/tree/topic/patmat-sat4j-cleanup2

Unfortunately I don't know how to properly add the Sat4j dependency to the build (I've just added the jar to lib/extra).

However, it seems difficult to judge how big the formulas for the exhaustivity check can become in regular Scala programs. Maybe the DPLL procedure is fast enough.
The following ticket seems related
- SI-6582 (linear-time translation into CNF for faster pattern-matching analyses)

The link there points to a Scala API to Sat4J, right?
