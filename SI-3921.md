There's another closely related memory leak in actor links (for the first one, see #3920). Exit message is sent as a normal message, which means that a reference to the last exiting actor is kept in the senders list of an Actor that's linked to it.

To reproduce: run the attached test case in the same way as in #3920. Links now get cleaned up properly, but one instance of Child will be kept alive by a reference in the sender list.
