I'm trying to install the Scala Eclipse plugin using Help/Software Updates/Find and Install on Eclipse 3.3.1.1 under MacOS 10.4.11 running Apple Java 1.5.0_13.  When I search for updates, the only version of the Scala plugin that Eclipse finds is "Scala Development Tools (JDK 1.5 non-BETA/Eclipse 3.2 only) 2.6.5".  When I select this feature, Eclipse displays an error message saying that the feature "requires plugin-in org.eclipse.pde.runtime" and won't allow me to install it.  Why?

In case it helps, I have attached my Eclipse configuration details.

Yes, it seems to work fine on Eclipse 3.2.2; thanks for the hint.  But the plugin should still work with Eclipse 3.3, right?  Especially given that [http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/eclipse/ the website] even says that the plugin *requires* 3.3.
