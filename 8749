`scala.repl.debug=true` shows the completer receives `bar"` to complete, with the line split on the comma, so when converting that to something it can type, it errors out.

It looks like the parsing is done on the scala side of jline, and maybe this comment is relevant:

{code}
def isQuoted = false // TODO
{code}
