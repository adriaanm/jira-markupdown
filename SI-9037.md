Hi guys,

I was playing around with the Scala syntax and found this unexpected behavior.

scala> var map = Map[String,String]()
map: scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,String] = Map()

scala> map += ( "x", "y" )
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("x")
 required: (String, String)
              map += ( "x", "y" )
                       ^
<console>:9: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("y")
 required: (String, String)
              map += ( "x", "y" )

scala> val a = ( "x", "y" )
a: (String, String) = (x,y)

scala> map += a

It seems like the expression is not parsed correctly. Expected behavior is simply adding to the map, which does work when I assign the expression to a variable first.

Kind regards,

Sjoerd.

I don't know if that answer is correct, but I can say it's surprisingly difficult to google it.
