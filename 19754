The problem for the {{toString}} implementation is that it is not overridden by {{TupleXZipped}} and therefore calls {{hashCode}}, which can never succeed on infinite sequences.

{{map}} computes all elements strictly and therefore is also broken (I guess all other methods of {{TupleXZipped}} are broken in a similar way).
