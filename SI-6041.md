Getting following exception (rarely) when processing list as a parallel collections:
```

```

The code is like following:

```scala
val l: List[A] = ... //some initialization
def mapper[A,B,C](v: A): (B,C) = {...}
val res = l.par.map(mapper).seq.toMap
```
Unfortunately, this issue becomes visible only approximately once a week. If I had a good test guaranteed to reproduce this issue, I'd share it with pleasure.

About scala 2.9.2: Is there any difference in parallel collections between 2.9.1 and 2.9.2? I have not found any in change log. However, we won't be able to upgrade to 2.9.2 shortly
Are you running on JDK 1.7 by any chance? Two fixes to parallel collections were backported to 2.9.2:

  https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/0e49b37
  https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/1016522

The second one is relevant here: It fixed selection of the suitable backend for the parallel collections, after the JDK Vendor property changed from Sun to Oracle.

Your stack trace indicates that you are using the `ThreadPoolTaskSupport`, which is definitely less efficient than `ForkJoinTaskSupport`. But I'm not aware of any difference between the two that might contribute to this bug.
