=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
{code}
Seq(1,2,3,4,5).lastIndexOfSlice(Seq(4,5),3)
Seq(1,2,3,4,5).lastIndexOfSlice(Seq(4),3)
Seq(1,2,3,4,5).lastIndexOfSlice(Seq(5),4)
{code}



=== What is the expected behavior? ===

The description for the method lastIndexOfSlice in SeqLike.scala states the following:

@return  the last index `<= end` such that the elements of this $$coll starting at this index
match the elements of sequence `that`, or `-1` of no such subsequence exists. 

Based on that description all the expressions given above should give results greater than zero.

The first two expressions should give the result 3 because the index 3 is indeed "<= end" (end is equal to 3) and the elements of "that" match the sequence starting at index 3 in both cases.

The last expression should give the result 4.

=== What do you see instead? ===

Instead they all give the result -1.

{code}
scala> Seq(1,2,3,4,5).lastIndexOfSlice(Seq(4,5),3)
res0: Int = -1

scala> Seq(1,2,3,4,5).lastIndexOfSlice(Seq(4),3)
res1: Int = -1

scala> Seq(1,2,3,4,5).lastIndexOfSlice(Seq(5),4)
res2: Int = -1
{code} 


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===

2.8.1, 1.6.0_21, Windows Vista

(In r24516) Fix for a big bug in lastIndexOfSlice and some latent negative index bugs
in both that and indexOfSlice.  This stuff is taxing.  Closes SI-4348, no review.
