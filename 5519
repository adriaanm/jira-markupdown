I think this is a valid bug.  It looks like the same kind of problem as scala/bug#3453.  (I'm not sure why !LowPriImplicits is in Josh's example, since it isn't used.)

As a simpler example:
```scala
object MyImplicits {
  implicit def str2int(x : String) = x.toInt
}
import MyImplicits._
object Foo {
  def str2int = null
  def test : Int = "5"
}
```

This compiles, although it should not.  The implicit str2int is not accessible without a prefix because the wildcard import is shadowed by the local definition.  If str2int is made implicit, scalac correctly generates an error.
