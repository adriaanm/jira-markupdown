{code}
class A {
  protected[this] def f() {}
}
class B extends A {
  super.f() // error: value f is not a member of A with ScalaObject
}
{code}

Works if super is omitted. Worked in some version prior 2.6.1.

(In r23486) protected[this] members should be accessible to super.x calls.
Closes SI-464, review by odersky.
