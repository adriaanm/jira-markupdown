The bottom right pane does not scroll on the ipad. This occurs with Safari as well as Chrome an make the scaladoc totally unusable.
It looks like the `div` (`"#content"`) that wraps the `iframe` needs to have: 

```javascript
overflow: auto;
-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
```

to enable scrolling on iOS; I tried this out using Safari's iOS developer tools, and after setting the properties I was able to scroll the main content on the iPad.

Fixed (see #8591).
