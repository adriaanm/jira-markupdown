The bottom right pane does not scroll on the ipad. This occurs with Safari as well as Chrome an make the scaladoc totally unusable.
It looks like the {{div}} ({{"#content"}}) that wraps the {{iframe}} needs to have: 

{code:javascript} 
overflow: auto;
-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
{code}

to enable scrolling on iOS; I tried this out using Safari's iOS developer tools, and after setting the properties I was able to scroll the main content on the iPad.

See: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4599153/iframes-and-the-safari-on-the-ipad-how-can-the-user-scroll-the-content]
Fixed (see SI-8591).
