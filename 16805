I'm not sure if this is really a bug but atleast it seems like unintended consequence.

Using MyEnumeration.values.map(p => (p -> DoSomehtingWith(p)) causes diverging implicit expansion error.
This used to work on 2.8 and 2.9 and you can go around with MyEnumeration.values.toList.map but that seems strange and unnecessary.
