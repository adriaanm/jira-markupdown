This won't compile:
{code}
object A {
  def foo(x: Int, y: Int*): Int = 45
  def foo[T](x: T*): Int = 55

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    foo(23, 23f)
  }
}
{code}
but we can see that it's application like: {{foo[AnyVal](23, 23f)}}
The method you defined 
{code}
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
     ...
  }
{code}
Which omits "=" and means the return type should be "Unit" ("void" in Java), but "foo(23, 23f)" as the last statement in method body returns "Int", that's why it cannot pass compiling. 
(In r19806) close SI-2665 and close SI-2667: use weak conformance in polymorphic case of isApplicable
reviewed by: odersky

exprTypeArgs now takes a comparison function: isWeaklyCompatible is passed in isApplicable's typesCompatible (to mimic what happens in the monomorphic case)
Martin: please review as this is different from my original proposal (that one broke type inference, this one passes all tests and does not slow down quick.comp)
