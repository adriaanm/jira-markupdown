Quite often when using a library, I will be looking at some sample code that uses the library and will want to look up the definition for some function, foo, but I don't know where foo is defined. Perhaps because foo is a pimped method, or it comes from an import like import blah.Bar._, etc.

In these cases, I have no way of finding the definition of foo. I could randomly look through the api docs in the hopes I find it, but that could take forever. My best bet is to download and grep the source... which is pretty lame.

Scaladoc would be an order of magnitude more useful with a search box where I can find **all** the instances of foo defined across all modules in the project, presented as a list of search results like a google search - I can then click on the result to go to the detailed docs on it. I think this could even completely replace the existing search panels. I imagine the "scaladoc" being a single text field centered on the page where you can enter search queries. If you just want to list all the classes, for example, perhaps you say "@class". If you want the class named Foo, you do "@class Foo". If you want the method bar you do "@method bar", etc. If you just want to see all "bar" identifiers, regardless of their type, you just do "bar". Etc. 

Some other ideas - eventually could add type-based queries. So "foo : Int => Int" finds methods and functions with that signature, "@class Foo: Baz" finds classes named Foo that are considered a subtype of Baz, and so on. 

It seems like this is probably all possible with some javascript magic.
Have you ever tried the alphabetical index under the search bar? (On the left panel)
Finding methods is what this index was introduced to do.

To continue with your above example, if you're looking for all possible locations a method `foo` might be defined, you would simply click the "F" under that search bar, and the right panel will turn to an index of all entities and members beginning with f/F, including methods. You'd simply locate `foo` in the list, and you'd see all classes/objects/traits which implement `foo`.

A live example is the method `map`, defined throughout the standard library. In looking at the scaladoc index page for M, [http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#index.index-m], one can see a list of all entities where `map` is implemented.

Regarding "pimped" methods-- Scaladoc in general doesn't list pimped methods on the class/object/trait they've been pimped onto, yet (expect a solution to this soon). So this is less of a problem with search, and a general soon-to-be-resolved-issue with Scaladoc. 

Regarding your other suggestions, such as searching across classes/methods and the type-based queries-- stuff like this would require something like a database, which isn't an option when statically generating documentation to be shipped in the distribution. For that, I'd recommend [scalex](http://scalex.org/) (or using the search bar on [docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org), which will very very soon return the results of a scalex query on the search results page.)
The `map` method is sitting right out in the open on the page I linked to above, I don't see how you could have trouble finding it:

Your suggestions do require an external database, for the js filtering to happen in a reasonable time frame. You're asking for all members and entities (and their signatures) of the entire Scala library and peripherals (like the actors library, Scala swing, etc) to be generated (regardless of the format) all on one HTML page and for us to provide a js filter to filter through all of it. That's not feasible or sensible via simple static HTML + js. 

A nicer UI than just static HTML? We're likely not going to change the generated format of the doc.

You're essentially asking us to build a completely different Scaladoc. This is not likely.

I remind you to consider comparing the usability of Scaladoc with javadoc.
