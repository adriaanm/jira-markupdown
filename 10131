Maybe we don't have all the facts yet, but the clues we have so far seem to indicate that the root cause lies in your JVM installation. Then the problem is compounded by Scala not printing as helpful a diagnostic as it could ("error in opening zip file" — which one?).

A couple things you could try to narrow down the conditions under which this occurs:

 * Try starting Scala as root. Does the problem go away? If so, that suggests permissions problems such as the one in the OpenSUSE bug (which I suspect contains useful clues even though you yourself aren't actually on OpenSUSE).
 * Try running with Java 7 instead of Java 6.

I especially recommend the latter; Java 6 is now basically dead and unsupported on Mac OS X as well as other platforms. I'd add that Java 6's checkered history on Mac OS X in particular means that (blatantly or subtly) broken Java 6 installations on Macs are not uncommon.

Whatever this problem is, it's quite rare; I've never seen it before, even though I've been helping newcomers with Scala (here, on IRC, and elsewhere) for half a decade now. I'm sorry this isn't working for you yet, but I can tell you that this isn't something first-time Scala users commonly hit.
