I am curious: Why does the rule `1 if A is defined in a class or object which is derived from the class or object defining B, 0 otherwise` exist? In most cases, `A` is either more or less specific than `B`, so the preceding rules about specificness should already make the decision. If `A` is as specific as `B`, then usually one of them overrides the other, so I would suppose the correct alternative is already being chosen by the rules of polymorphism. If not, then we have a pathological case where `A` is as specific as `B`, but neither overrides the other; then this rule leads to shadowing of class members by members defined in a subclass.
