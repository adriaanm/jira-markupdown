I'm not sure how it came about that they asked you for a patch.  I give this more like -10.  I can't believe the patch would ever be used, and anyway it's like a one line change, it's not like we don't know how to do it.

Like retronym says, if we're going to mess with precedence it will not be piecemeal.
