It doesn't matter if equals lies, the pattern match in this ticket should never even call equals. The match is only supposed to happen if x is reference equal to y, which will make it difficult to introduce unsoundness based on the type of y.

There is definitely grave unsoundness related to trusting equals - SI-1503 is the main ticket - this is not that. See SI-4577, which I marked as a "blocker" at some point, ha ha.
