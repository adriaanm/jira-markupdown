pendingSuperCall introduced in a pre-typemacros commit isn't forward compatible with 2.10.0. We need to allow structurally equal alternatives to be used in its place and keep pendingSuperCall itself out of the API until 2.11.
`NonemptyAttachments` is private; it used to be `Attachments$NonemptyAttachments`. No class other than `Attachments` can reference this.
