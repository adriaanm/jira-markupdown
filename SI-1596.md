Running this program and clicking on the label does only print "Mouse pressed", and not also "Mouse pressed2" in 2.7.2 under linux on openjdk 6u12

{code}
import scala.swing._
import scala.swing.event._
object Bug extends SimpleGUIApplication{
def top = new MainFrame{
     contents = new Label { text = "Hello"
      import java.awt.event._
      peer.addMouseListener (new MouseAdapter{
        override def mousePressed(e : MouseEvent ) {
          println("Mouse pressed")
        }
      })
      reactions += {
	     case MousePressed(_,_,_,_,_) => {
	       println("Mouse pressed2")
	     }
      }
}
}
}

{code}
It's not the component itself that publishes mouse events. See the mouse object in Component. For clicks you have to call 
{code}
listenTo(Mouse.clicks)
{code}
on your subscriber, i.e., in the label in your example.
