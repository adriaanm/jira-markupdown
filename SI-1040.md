Using version of the Scala compiler that ships with the latest nightly build of the Eclipse plugin (version 2.7.1.r15371-b20080614010057), the following code should compile but does not:

{code}
object Bug {
  val list = 1 to 5 toList
  println(list)
}
{code}

with the following errors:
{code}
recursive value list needs type
type mismatch;
 found   : Unit
 required: Int
{code}

If a blank line is added as follows:
{code}
object Bug {
  val list = 1 to 5 toList

  println(list)
}
{code}
then it compiles fine, which would seem to indicate that the problem lies with the algorithm used to determine if the end of the line is the end of the statement.

Both examples compile with version 2.7.1-final of the Scala compiler.
