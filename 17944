This code compiles in 2.10.0, fails in 2.10.1-SNAPSHOT.
{code}
package object foo {
  implicit def seqInt: SeqInt = ???
}
package foo {
  class SeqInt
  class A { def g(implicit ev: SeqInt): SeqInt = implicitly[SeqInt] }
}
{code}
According to https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/scala-internals/excJWfA7GTU it is not supposed to compile, but we can't break code in the 2.10 series.

Requirements for compilation:

1) class SeqInt is in package foo, not some other package
2) def g has an explicit return type.
