I agree with Seth, it looks to me like too much of a special case to be added to scala.Option. After all you need to provide the type parameter `Option[Long]` explicitly to trigger the NPE. This is consistent with existing behavior:
```scala
scala> (null: java.lang.Long): Long
java.lang.NullPointerException
  at scala.Predef$.Long2long(Predef.scala:368)
  ... 28 elided
```
