{code}
scala> class C(x: Int = 1)(y: Int)

scala> new C()
<console>:9: error: missing arguments for constructor C in class C
Error occurred in an application involving default arguments.
{code}

This does not tell you that an entire parameter list is missing. You might be tempted to think that there's a problem with the default.

For methods we're good:
{code}
scala> def foo(x: Int = 1)(y: Int) = 1

scala> foo()
<console>:9: error: missing arguments for method foo;
follow this method with `_' if you want to treat it as a partially applied function
{code}
