Opening this ticket to track what if anything we can agree to do about the propagation of singleton types. Today's example:
```scala
trait Foo {
  def andThis(): this.type = this

  def setFoo1()            = andThis()
  def setFoo2(): this.type = andThis()
}

class Bar extends Foo {
  def f1(): Bar = setFoo1() // does not compile
  def f2(): Bar = setFoo2() // compiles
}
```
There are a lot of other examples available; I am linking to some tickets which swirl around the same question.
Well, if I can figure out how to link that is. Oh well, I'll just list them here. #837, #1273, #4663, #4914, #5103. And see also #5210.
