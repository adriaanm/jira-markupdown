I found an instance where the scala optimizer is generating incorrect bytecode which results in broken integer arithmetic (given a 39 where it should give a -5000). It happens for all versions of scala `2.11.x` but worked correctly in `2.10.x`. It only happens with `-optimize`.

I've put the complete code necessary to reproduce on [github](https://github.com/jdolson/scala_optimizer_bug). But I'll paste the important bits here. The following two files must in different projects (e.g. a main and a test project) in order to trigger the bug:
 
```scala
package bug // in main
final case class Bust (x: Long) extends AnyVal {
  @inline def bar: Long = 10000L / (if (x < 0) -2 else 2)
}
```

```scala
package bug // in test
object Busted {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val p = Bust(-1L)
    val y = p.bar
    println(y) // should print -5000 but prints 39
  }
}
```

Looking at the bytecode the problem happens when the `bar` method is inlined. Scala 2.10 generates this
```
Compiled from "Busted.scala"
public final class bug.Busted$ {
  public static final bug.Busted$ MODULE$;

  public static {};
    Code:
       0: new           #2                  // class bug/Busted$
       3: invokespecial #12                 // Method "<init>":()V
       6: return        

  public void main(java.lang.String[]);
    Code:
       0: getstatic     #19                 // Field bug/Bust$.MODULE$:Lbug/Bust$;
       3: astore_2      
       4: ldc2_w        #20                 // long 10000l
       7: ldc2_w        #22                 // long -1l
      10: lconst_0      
      11: lcmp          
      12: iflt          19
      15: iconst_2      
      16: goto          21
      19: bipush        -2
      21: i2l           
      22: ldiv          
      23: lstore_3      
      24: getstatic     #28                 // Field scala/Predef$.MODULE$:Lscala/Predef$;
      27: lload_3       
      28: invokestatic  #34                 // Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToLong:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
      31: invokevirtual #38                 // Method scala/Predef$.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
      34: return        
}
```

whereas Scala 2.11 is generating this:

```
Compiled from "Busted.scala"
public final class bug.Busted$ {
  public static final bug.Busted$ MODULE$;

  public static {};
    Code:
       0: new           #2                  // class bug/Busted$
       3: invokespecial #12                 // Method "<init>":()V
       6: return        

  public void main(java.lang.String[]);
    Code:
       0: getstatic     #19                 // Field bug/Bust$.MODULE$:Lbug/Bust$;
       3: astore_2      
       4: ldc2_w        #20                 // long 10000l
       7: ldc2_w        #22                 // long -1l
      10: lconst_0      
      11: lcmp          
      12: iflt          19
      15: iconst_2      
      16: goto          22
      19: sipush        254
      22: i2l           
      23: ldiv          
      24: lstore_3      
      25: getstatic     #28                 // Field scala/Predef$.MODULE$:Lscala/Predef$;
      28: lload_3       
      29: invokestatic  #34                 // Method scala/runtime/BoxesRunTime.boxToLong:(J)Ljava/lang/Long;
      32: invokevirtual #38                 // Method scala/Predef$.println:(Ljava/lang/Object;)V
      35: return        
}
```
The only meaningful difference is that `bipush -2` is getting replaced with `sipush 254`, which is clearly incorrect.
Yes, I can workaround this particular bug in any number of ways. The real problem is that I can't trust the optimizer in 2.11. The above example is just one particular bug that I was able to isolate. I have more, I just haven't been able to isolate them yet. I have a value class many of whose methods are marked `@inline` that I use extensively, and many of the unit tests that use this class (directly or indirectly) are failing. These tests all pass if I leave off `-optimise`.

This is a show-stopper for me. I can't upgrade my project to Scala 2.11 because of it.
found the bug - quite surprised it wasn't reported before. PR coming soon. bonus points if you see how ~~2 and 254 are related :~~)
Thanks for fixing this so quickly guys. One question for you: Not knowing the internals of scalac very well, I don't know how or where `ICodeReader` is used. Clearly it must be used by the optimizer. Is this bug limited to `-optimise` or are there other things that could trigger the bug even without `-optimise`. In other words, is scala 2.11.7 immune to this issue if `-optimise` is not specified?
`ICodeReader` is only used in the optimizer, and only used in the `GenASM` backend (which is the default in the Scala 2.11 series.)

It is responsible for reading bytecode of previously compiled classes and translating them into an intermediate representation called `ICode` that is used in the compilation pipeline. This allows inlining of methods under separate compilation.

So disabling `-optimize` is a valid workaround for this bug.
