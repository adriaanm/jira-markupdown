```scala
trait TreesBase {
  type Tree

  type Apply <: Tree

  val Apply: ApplyExtractor

  abstract class ApplyExtractor {
    def apply(x: Int): Apply
    def unapply(apply: Apply): Option[Int]
  }
}

trait TreesApi extends TreesBase {
  def Apply(x: String)
}

class Universe extends TreesApi {
  abstract class Tree
  case class Apply(x: Int) extends Tree
  object Apply extends ApplyExtractor
  def Apply(x: String) = Apply(x.toInt)
}

object Test extends App {
  def foo(tapi: TreesApi) {
    import tapi._
    def bar(tree: Tree) {
      val Apply(x) = tree
    }
  }
}
```

```scala

I'm not sure. I'd say that a pattern `Apply( x ): SelectorType` should type check iff exists T in (SelectorType, Nothing) so that `Apply.unapply(<sel: T>)` type checks (must allow type slack on the unapply's arg since we'll insert a type test before the unapply call if necessary).

However, replacing `val Apply( x ) = tree` by `Apply.unapply(tree)` in your example causes the following error:

```scala
both method Apply in trait TreesApi of type (x: String)Unit
and  value Apply in trait TreesBase of type => tapi.ApplyExtractor
match expected type ?
      Apply.unapply(tree)
```

So, either we should fix that, or this pattern should not type check.
... we could do this by refining `inferExprAlternative` to discard alternatives that require arguments, when in QUALmode (since we'd be in FUNmode if an application followed, or in EXPRmode if we can deal with converting a method reference to a function -- QUALmode, as I understand it, excludes that)
