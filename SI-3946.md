Given the the following files:

`p/J.java`

{code}
package p;
public class J {
    protected void m() { return; }
}
{code}


`p/S.scala`
{code}
package p
class S extends J {
  override protected def m { }
}
{code}

Compiling them together with `scalac` gives the correct error message:

{code}
lamppc11:bug1 luc$$ ../../target/pack/bin/scalac p/J.java p/S.scala
p/S.scala:3: error: overriding method m in class J of type ()Unit;
 method m has weaker access privileges; it should be at least protected[p]
  override protected def m { }
                         ^
one error found
{code}

However, when compiling first the Java file, then the Scala file there's no error message:

{code}
lamppc11:bug1 luc$$ javac p/J.java 
lamppc11:bug1 luc$$ ../../target/pack/bin/scalac p/S.scala 
lamppc11:bug1 luc$$

(In r23673) close SI-3946. protected in java means access boundary is the package. review by dragos.
(In r23704) follow up on fix SI-3946. relaxed access boundry check for overriding protected java member.
By Paul: I find experimentally that javac lets access tighten such that whether
you can call a method depends on the static type of the argument, which
would seem like an unfortunate thing to emulate, but possibly not the
worst thing being considered.

{code}
// J1.java
package bip;

public class J {
 // package[bip] + protected f()
 protected void f() { }
}
{code}

{code}
// J2.java
package notbip;

public class J2 extends bip.J {
 // this override "should" not be allowed, it excludes package bip
 // now package[notbip] + protected f()
 @Override
 protected void f() { }
}
{code}

{code}
// J3.java
package bip;

public class J3 {
 public void g(bip.J x) {
   x.f();  // ok
   notbip.J2 y = (notbip.J2)x;
   y.f();  // fails
   // J3.java:7: f() has protected access in notbip.J2
   //     y.f();
   //      ^
   // 1 error
 }
}
{code}
We discussed this in today's meeting. Martin was surprised how broken
"protected" in Java is (see Paul's example).

Summing up. Given the Java class:

{code}
package p;
public class A {
    protected void f() {}
}
{code}

This indeed means, in Scala terms, "f" is "protected[p]", i.e. we should set
the "privateWithin" flag to "p". Otherwise, the following Scala code would
not be legal:

{code}
package p {
  object T {
    val a = new A()
    a.f()
  }
}
{code}

This has been fixed in SI-3946, but with the unfortunate consequence on
overriding, which invalidates the following (previously valid) Scala code:

{code}
package q {
  class B extends p.A {
    override protected def f() { }
  }
}
{code}

Note that the same situation is much more unlikely to happen in
Scala-only code, because when one writes "class A" in Scala, writing
"protected def f", would mean "protected[A]", not "protected[p]".

We concluded in our discussion that

 * Most Scala programmers are not aware that "protected" in Java actually means accessible in the package ("protected[p]")
 * Changing override rules now would be too confusing, and also invalidate a non-acceptable amount of existing Scala code

The easiest solution seems to be a special case when checking the
accessibility of an override. If the overridden symbol is java and protected,
ignore the "privateWithin".
