=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
A3.scala:
{code}
abstract class One {
  def spec(a: String) = new TestAnom(a) {
    def foo = 12
    class E extends D
    def bar = a
  }
}

abstract class TestAnom(v: String) {
  def foo: Int
  def bar: String
}

class D
{code}

Build manager:

{code}
> scala scala.tools.nsc.interactive.BuildManagerTest -d /tmp/ src/A3.scala
compiling Set(src/A3.scala)
Changes: Map()
builder > src/A3.scala
compiling Set(src/A3.scala)
scala.tools.nsc.symtab.Types$$MissingTypeControl

{code} 

This is the bug that has been hunting us for some time now and that makes bm in eclipse unusable. I have a temporary fix for that ready to commit (in a second), but the real solution and diagnosis will have to come later.

Note: this is a reduced example of what is happening in for example SpecializeTypes.scala (`def specializeCalls`).
