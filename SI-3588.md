Currently when declaring something one faces a choice: either say nothing about the type or fully specify it.

This causes redundancy in some cases, like the following:
{code}
var x : Map[Int, Int] = new HashMap[Int, Int]()
{code}

In this case, the "[Int, Int]" part is redundant, but omitting the type doesn't give the desired type.

The proposal to solve this is to allow specifying a type pattern instead of the type, like this:
{code}
var x : Map[_, _] = new HashMap[Int, Int]()
{code}

If multiple matches are possible, either raise an error or take the structural type which is the union of the matches.

If no matches are possible, raise an error.

Setting aside the issue of compiler complexity, the proposed syntax is already spoken for. `Map[_, _]` is an existential type, it is shorthand for `Map[A, B] forSome { type A; type B}`

For the particular example, you can avoid repeating the types of the key and value by inferring them on the right-hand-side.

{code}
import collection.mutable.HashMap
var x : collection.Map[Int, Int] = new HashMap() 
{code}

Closing as needinfo. Might I suggest that you raise these sort of questions first on scala-debate, where you will get a wider audience for discussion?
