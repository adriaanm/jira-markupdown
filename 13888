I created a new Scala project. Within my src folder, I created a new package, com.sas.djb
and added a class T.scala:
```scala
package com.sas.djb

import scala.util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers
import scala.collection.mutable.Map

class T extends RegexParsers {
   def FOR = regex("for".r)
}
```

The imports ("util" and "collection") are flagged with warnings such as

value util is not a member of package com.sas.djb.scala

See the attached screenshot.

The warnings do not show up in the Problems view

If I close then reopen T.scala, there are no warnings.
If I modify the buffer, the warning flags reappear
(with pink gutter markers) but they still do not 
apepar in the Problems view.

Also note the refresh problem in the attached screenshot;
the def FOR = ... line appears twice but it only exists once
in the source; the editor did not refresh it correctly.
(I had positioned the cursor on the blank line before
the class keyword and pressed Backspace to delete the
blank line).

I created another package in my src firectory, djb, 
and created another T.scala there:
```scala
package djb

import scala.util.parsing.combinator.RegexParsers
import scala.collection.mutable.Map

class T extends RegexParsers {
   def FOR = regex("for".r)
}
```

and there are no warnings.

This is a new install of Eclipse 3.4 J2EE Ganymede and scala-eclipse 2.7.2 on Windows XP, JDK is 1.6.0_05
