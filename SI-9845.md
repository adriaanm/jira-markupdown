That syntax is explicitly allowed and useful. 7.1 says "parameters labeled with an implicit modifier."

But the edge case is that you can't do that with the first parameter, even if you supply other modifiers. Instead, it's turned into an implicit parameter list.

```scala
scala> class C(private implicit val c: Int, val s: String) {
     | def f = implicitly[Int] }
defined class C

scala> new C()    // didn't want an implicit param list
<console>:13: error: could not find implicit value for parameter c: Int
       new C()
       ^

scala> def f(implicit i: Int, s: String) = s + i   // no ambiguity for methods
f: (implicit i: Int, implicit s: String)String
```

I asked about that once and it was deemed too finicky.
