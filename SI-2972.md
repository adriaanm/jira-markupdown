It's a relatively common operation to call toSeq on other collection types (to pass it to methods that require a Seq, like sort) so I believe we should try to be efficient.

TraversableLike currently it calls toList, but that is not particularly efficient and there is a toList method for people who want a List (and can benefit from it). Ideally we'd return a properly-sized GenericArray or ArrayBuffer, but I don't see a way to check if a given collection has an efficient size method, so the simplest seems to make it call toIndexedSeq.

MapLike and SetLike both suggest providing an efficient size method and the implementations override isEmpty as size == 0, so I think it is OK to rely on the size in toSeq.

With that in mind, for MapLike.toSeq, I'd suggest something like:

```scala
  override def toSeq: Seq[(A, B)] = {
    val result = new mutable.GenericArray[(A, B)](size)
    var i = 0
    for (x <- this) {
      result(i) = x
      i += 1
    }
    result
  }
```

For SetLike.toSeq, I'd suggest something like:

```scala
  override def toSeq: Seq[A] = {
    val result = new mutable.GenericArray[A](size)
    var i = 0
    for (x <- this) {
      result(i) = x
      i += 1
    }
    result
  }
```

It's obviously possible to reduce duplication by having a toGenericArray in Traversable or as a utility method that takes a traversable somewhere for internal methodsr1.

If this is deemed a good idea and patches (with tests) would help, I could provide those.

r1 Note that a toGenericArray would be useful in other places too, like Seq.sortWith.
