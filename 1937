This is a really nasty issue that prevents Scala from being used with a great many modern frameworks that rely on reflection and annotation scanning for service detection. This issue is a showstopper for anybody who wants to use Scala in a Java EE environment (like me).  

(I apologize that this is a bit of a "me too," but I think this issue is serious enough that it warrants the bump. This, along with the related scala/bug#6546, are in danger of killing the Scala pilot at my company. I can't even load our code into the same container without breaking the whole deployment.)

If binary compatibility is the concern, maybe we can have a compiler flag or something?  If a new compiler could support both versions, I could happily throw the switch and not worry about old compilers being able to use my libraries.  I might even be willing to write some code here, but I'm not sure that it would actually save any time by the time someone finished pointing me in the right direction as I don't really know the Scala compiler. :-)
