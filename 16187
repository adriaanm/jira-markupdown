In scala REPL :
```scala
scala> None.foreach{ println("KO"); _.toString} }}
KO
```
I expected that nothing was printed, since None contains no value... The same result happens in a compiled project.

However, when the variable is named, it works :
```scala
scala> None.foreach{ x => println("KO"); x.toString}
```

It seems to come from the placeholder, but is it due to a bug in None or is it due to the scala transformation from a "lambda function" to a Function1 object ?

Same behaviour with map.
