Using Scala Eclipse Plugin   2.8.0.r20214-b20091218041230    

Importing the attached project into a blank workspace I can

1) Right click on App.scala -> Run As -> Scala Application -> The app
prints Hello World
2) Right click on the class SimpleUnitTest -> Run As -> JUnit Test ->
Error dialog "The input type of the launch configuration does not
exist"

If I then do 

 1. Select your project
 1. Go to "Build Path / Configure Build Path"
 1. In the "Libraries" tab, "Add Class Folder"
 1. In the "Class Folder Selection" dialog, do "Create New Folder"
 1. In the "New Folder" dialog, select "Advanced" and "Link to folder in the file system"
 1. Select the output folder of your project 

I can then launch the unit test correctly in step 2) 

This is actually just a classpath ordering issue. Starting from the project you provided I was able to reproduce the problem and your work around. I then removed the output folder from the classpath and removed and re-added the specs .jar. This had the effect of moving specs towards the end of the classpath (ie. after JUnit, but before the project's output folder). With this configuation the test runs as expected.

The before and after of the .classpath are,

Before (ie. failing)
```scala
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src"/>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="test"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.launching.SCALA_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/specs-1.6.1-2.8.0.Beta1-RC3.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.JUNIT_CONTAINER/4"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="bin"/>
</classpath>
```

After (ie. succeeding)
```scala
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src"/>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="test"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.launching.SCALA_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jdt.junit.JUNIT_CONTAINER/4"/>
	<classpathentry kind="lib" path="lib/specs-1.6.1-2.8.0.Beta1-RC3.jar"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="bin"/>
</classpath>
```

So I think that the behaviour you're seeing is to be expected in the absence of specs-specific tooling which knows about the correct relative ordering of the specs and JUnit jars.

Feel free to open an enhancement ticket for that, and in the meantime you'll need to deal with this manually ... the rule would be: add the JUnit library to the classpath before the specs jar.
No, my mistake. The issue is reproducible with either classpath order.

What's making the difference is SimpleSpec.scala being open in an editor or not: if it is, then the test runs as expected; if it isn't, then, as reported, the error "The input type of the launch configuration does not exist" is shown.
(In r20424) Fixed #2815.
