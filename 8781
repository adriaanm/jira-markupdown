I had a feeling that'd be the answer, but I can't figure out why {{x}} in {{x => new x.Bar}} should be a stable identifier and {{_}} isn't. {{x}} is not a member of anything, and the language that defines a stable path seems to only allow members to form parts of a path; but obviously that sort of thing (using parameters or local vals in stable paths) works. Is it just a de facto rule that this courtesy doesn't extend to the placeholder syntax?
