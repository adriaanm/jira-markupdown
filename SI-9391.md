I am attempting to compile a generated Scala project (its a wsdl SOAP API which generates .scala sources, which are then compiled), and I am getting the following error

https://gist.github.com/mdedetrich/069a9b506eb6b7ff01ed

One important thing to note, is that the generated scala sources are huge (it generates 3891 scala sources, some of those files end up having > 100k lines of source code). To generate the Scala sources themselves, it takes around 2-3 hours, and to compile the sources it takes around 5 hours (with the following SBT arguments so it doesn't run out of memory)

```scala
-J-Xmx8G
-J-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1G
-J-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
-J-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
```

There is a github issue for this on scala-xb (https://github.com/eed3si9n/scalaxb/issues/234#issuecomment-120563849), however this appears to be strictly a scala compiler problem, probably due to a corner case of compiling such a huge number of sources.

Note that I do have the .wsdl sources/SBT project in question, however I can't share it publicly because its a private API. I can however provide a private link to download the SBT project to whoever is working on the issue.
