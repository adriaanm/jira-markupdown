somebody who knows the ClassfileParser, especially the part about inner classes, should fix this (I couldn't find the problem within reasonable time).

When parsing the annotation ("parseAnnotation"), the method "sigToType" is called with `Lorg.junit.runners.Suite$$SuiteClasses;` as "sig"-argument. I don't know if this is the correct way to get to an inner class.
