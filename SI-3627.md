The bytecode for C$$Concrete$$mcI$$sp in the following example gets two  proto: Int methods, one that forwards to the proto$$mcI$$sp method and one that accesses the proto$$mcI$$sp field:
{code}
object C {
  trait Base[@specialized A] {
    val proto: A
  }

  class Concrete[@specialized A](val proto: A) extends Base[A]

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    new Concrete(10)
  }
}
{code}
If I remove @specialized from Concrete, things work.  Tested against RC7.
There is a workaround for this problem: instead of val use def.
{code}
  trait Base[@specialized A] {
    def proto: A
  }
{code}

Only tested with vals, but may work with vars.
Tested with Scala 2.8.0.RC7.
