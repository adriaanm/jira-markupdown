I reported it against the Standard Library, not Eclipse. Whether this is a compiler issue or a library issue is not for me to say (personally I feel the library classes are wrong, even if this is a compiler issue).

A test case is trivial, the code below reports the error on {{p.subscribe( this )}}

{code}
package bugs

import scala.collection.mutable.Publisher
import scala.collection.mutable.Subscriber

object PubSub
{
  class Evt

  class MyPublisher extends Publisher[Evt]
  {
    
  }
  
  class MySubscriber( val p: MyPublisher ) extends Subscriber[Evt,MyPublisher]
  {
    p.subscribe( this )
  }

}
{code}
