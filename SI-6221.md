The Scala compiler does not infer the argument types for function expressions (e.g. x => x+1) when the function is passed to a method that requires it to be implicitly converted to another type, even though it does infer the types of other objects in a similar situation. (Thanks to Heather Miller for pointing out the second case.) For example, take a look at the attached test2.scala:

```scala
class MyFunc[-A, +B] {}

class MyCollection[A] {
  def map[B](f: MyFunc[A, B]): MyCollection[B] = new MyCollection[B]
}

class OtherFunc[-A, +B] {}

object Test {
  implicit def functionToMyFunc[A, B](f: A => B): MyFunc[A, B] = new MyFunc

  implicit def otherFuncToMyFunc[A, B](f: OtherFunc[A, B]): MyFunc[A, B] = new MyFunc

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val col = new MyCollection[Int]

    // Doesn't compile: error: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1) => x$1.toString)
    // println(col.map(_.toString)) 

    // Doesn't compile: error: missing parameter type
    // println(col.map(x => x.toString))

    // Does compile
    println(col.map((x: Int) => x.toString))
    
    // Does compile (even though type params of OtherFunc not given)
    println(col.map(new OtherFunc))
  }
}
```

This is a problem for cases where you want to represent functions through some richer class, or to apply a macro to function expressions passed to a set of methods. For example, in Spark, I would like to apply a macro to all closure expressions passed to map(), filter(), groupBy(), and other operations in order to properly bind variables, and I would've liked to do this through an implicit conversion macro from Function1[A, B] to ShippableFunction[A, B]. Because of this bug, this can't be done without losing type inference. It would be nice to add it in this case since it seems that the types for other objects can be inferred anyway.
Update on this after digging around a bit.

The following seems to happen. 

In the case of `col.map(new OtherFunc)`, the expected type of `map` is `MyFunc[Int,?\]`. Meanwhile, the type parameters of `OtherFunc` are inferred independently of the implicit conversion to be `OtherFunc[Any, Nothing\]`.

In the case of `col.map(_.toString)`, the expected type of `map` is also `MyFunc[Int,?\]`.
However, in this case, implicit search seems to try to find a conversion from `Function1[<error>,<error>\]` to the above expected type.

-Ydebug -Ylog:typer output for the {{col.map(_.toString)}} case:
```scala
[log typer] inferring view from scala.this.Function1[<error>,<error>] to <empty>.this.MyFunc[scala.this.Int,?]
[log typer] infer view from scala.this.Function1[<error>,<error>] to <empty>.this.MyFunc[scala.this.Int,?]
```

In both cases, implicit search does not have an influence on inferring the type of the argument of `map`. This doesn't seem to be spec'd, but I agree that this would be very nice to have.
Seems related #7187
