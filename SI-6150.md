When #5937 was fixed, that is in this https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/d8fbd9a54d commit, a new problem was introduced:

```scala
scala> import collection.generic.CanBuildFrom
import collection.generic.CanBuildFrom

scala> import collection.immutable.{IndexedSeq => IIdxSeq}
import collection.immutable.{IndexedSeq=>IIdxSeq}

scala> val cbf1 = implicitly[CanBuildFrom[Vector[Int],Int,IIdxSeq[Int]]]
cbf1: ... = scala.collection.immutable.Vector$VectorReusableCBF@106ac20f

scala> val cbf2 = implicitly[CanBuildFrom[IIdxSeq[Int],Int,IIdxSeq[Int]]]
cbf2: ... = scala.collection.generic.GenTraversableFactory$ReusableCBF@583dfc8b
```

With {{cbf2}}, the check in {{Vector}}'s methods {{updated}}, {{\+:}}, and {{:+}} for optimised O(1) algorithms *fails*.

-----

The suggested solution is as follows: the default implementation of `collection.IndexedSeq` is `collection.immutable.IndexedSeq`, and that in turn gives `Vector`. `Vector` can thus safely call the optimised methods when the builder target is `ndexedSeq`. The long-term solution probably is to introduce an `IndexedSeqFactory`. The direct fix is to move the newly introduced builder factory instance `VectorReusableCBF` from the `Vector` module to the `IndexedSeq` module.

Indeed, I think it would be sufficient, instead of creating a new class, to ensure a fresh instance of `ReusableCBF`, e.g.

```scala
object IndexedSeq extends SeqFactory[IndexedSeq] {
  override lazy val ReusableCBF: GenericCanBuildFrom[Nothing] = new ReusableCBF // ensure a fresh instance
  ...
}
```

Then, instead of checking the class using pattern matching, one could simply use `eq`:

```scala
  @inline override def :+[B >: A, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Vector[A], B, That]): That = {
    if(bf eq IndexedSeq.ReusableCBF) {
      appendBack(elem).asInstanceOf[That] // just ignore bf
    } else {
      super.:+(elem)(bf)
    }
  }
```

Of course, if you prefer a class type check, you may just move `VectorReusableCBF` to `IndexedSeq` and keep the pattern match as `case _: IndexedSeq.VectorReusableCBF => ...`

-----

Finally, it needs to be contemplated whether the new builder factory is safe in {{collection.IndexedSeq}}, or would have to be in {{collection.immutable.IndexedSeq}} so as not to interfere with {{collection.mutable.IndexedSeq}}? I think there is no problem -- if you append an element to a {{Vector}} and expect a {{collection.IndexedSeq}}, it's correct to return another {{Vector}}.

I agree that using `eq` is a better idea.

Also, given that the default implementation of the `collection.IndexedSeq` remains a `Vector`, optimizing `:+` and `+:` on the `Vector` while expecting an `IndexedSeq` should not cause a problem as far as I can see.
Although, ideally, we'd like to test if the factory produces a `VectorBuilder`, irrespective of where the factory came from. That, however, requires instantiating an empty `VectorBuilder`, which is probably (?) prohibitive for smaller vectors.
Currently, it is only in the master branch, ie 2.11.0.

```scala
git branch --contains 0308ae8 | egrep '(2.10|master)'
  master
```

I agree that we should back port for 2.10.1 (it might be too late for 2.10.0).
I believe that we're seeing a new variant of this same issue in scala `2.10.4`. For code looping to grow a Vector using `:+`, we see a huge amount of time spent in the following stack:
```
scala.collection.generic.Growable$$anonfun$$plus$plus$eq$1.apply(Growable.scala:48)
scala.collection.generic.Growable$$anonfun$$plus$plus$eq$1.apply(Growable.scala:48)
scala.collection.Iterator$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:727)
scala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1157)
scala.collection.IterableLike$class.foreach(IterableLike.scala:72)
scala.collection.AbstractIterable.foreach(Iterable.scala:54)
scala.collection.generic.Growable$class.$plus$plus$eq(Growable.scala:48)
scala.collection.immutable.VectorBuilder.$plus$plus$eq(Vector.scala:716)
scala.collection.immutable.VectorBuilder.$plus$plus$eq(Vector.scala:692)
scala.collection.SeqLike$class.$colon$plus(SeqLike.scala:529)
scala.collection.immutable.Vector.$colon$plus(Vector.scala:153)
<snip>
```
Here's a test case that drastically improves from 2.10.0 to 2.10.1

```scala
object Test extends App {
  type Upcast = IndexedSeq[String]
  var i = 0
  while (i < 100) {
    var v: Upcast = Vector("")
    var j = 0
    val t = System.nanoTime
    while (j < 100000) {
      v = (v: Upcast) :+ ""
      j += 1
    }
    println(s"${(System.nanoTime - t).toDouble / 1000 / 1000} / ${v.length}")
    i += 1
  }
}
```

```
// 2.10.0
...
20382.243 / 100001
20260.872 / 100001
20227.341 / 100001
20231.207 / 100001
24530.945 / 100001
24490.411 / 100001

// 2.10.1
...
5.525 / 100001
7.932 / 100001
8.954 / 100001
6.907 / 100001
5.614 / 100001
5.926 / 100001
5.442 / 100001
```

Could you please whittle down your problem to something similar that **doesn't** show the same improvement?
I should also mention that creating lots of throwaway intermediate Vectors, even with this fix, is always going to be more expensive than using an imperative Builder within the loop. Here's an example that is an order of magnitude faster.

```scala
object Test extends App {
  type Upcast = IndexedSeq[String]
  var i = 0
  while (i < 100) {
    var v: Upcast = Vector("")
    var j = 0
    val t = System.nanoTime
    val builder = Vector.newBuilder[String]
    while (j < 100000) {
      builder += ""
      j += 1
    }
    v = builder.result
    println(s"${(System.nanoTime - t).toDouble / 1000 / 1000} / ${v.length}")
    i += 1
  }
}
```


```
// 2.10.1
...
0.372 / 100000
0.372 / 100000
0.375 / 100000
0.374 / 100000
0.372 / 100000
0.372 / 100000
0.37 / 100000
0.381 / 100000
0.378 / 100000
0.378 / 100000
```

If you use a suitable persistent data structure like `List` that has a free prepend, you can keep things pure. But Vector's append/prepend is more expensive (as a tradeoff to make its indexing faster).
Making a small edit to your example reproduces the slowdown:
```scala
-  type Upcast = IndexedSeq[String]
+  type Upcast = Seq[String]
```

The runtime with an upcast to Seq is:
```
55178.384 / 100001
55987.473 / 100001
...
```

At some level it makes sense that you must declare something as an IndexedSeq to get O(1)ish behaviour. But... was this intended?
This one is still broken in 2.10.4 and 2.11.2:

```scala
Vector.fill(10000000)(0).foldLeft(Vector.empty[Int]: Seq[Int])((a, b) => a :+ b)
```
@axel22 Would your fix for this with when the static type is `IndexedSeq` generalize to weaker types like `Seq`?
Jason:
As far as I can tell, yes, the fix should work.

The ` :+ ` and ` +: ` methods must return a collection of type `That`, where `That` comes from the `CanBuildFrom` object.
Since the `ReusableCBF` that comes from the `Seq` companion must has `Seq[A]` for `That`, and because:

- the default implementation of `:+` will return statically `Seq[A]`
- and anyway a `Vector` at runtime

It should be perfectly fine to use `eq`, which returns a `Vector` as an optimization.

Note to bug reporters, though - as Jason suggests, you should really use a `VectorBuilder` if you care about performance. And if you really, really care about append performance, use an `ArrayBuffer`, or better yet, a Conc-tree buffer from an external library (published through Sonatype):
https://github.com/storm-enroute/reactive-collections/blob/master/reactive-collections-core/src/main/scala/scala/reactive/core/ConcBuffer.scala
I created #8930 to track the remaining issue so that it doesn't get lost.
