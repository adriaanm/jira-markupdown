First of all, I would never have known the light grey bar at the top expands by clicking.  Never.  Only by asking on IRC did I discover this.  This cannot be the way.

Then, even after being led by the nose to this, it took me way too long to find the link to the companion object.

The companion object is fundamental.  It is not some incidental aspect of the class which can be placed in documentation siberia.  There is a giant green bar at the top of the page which uses about 40 pixels to say "Set" and then is nothing but empty green for the next 2000 pixels.  That's where a link to the companion object belongs.

This should be fixed for 2.9, it makes me mad to think about how much unnecessary difficulty we are imposing on people who want to learn the language.  I'll do it if nobody else will.
(In r24679) [scaladoc] Make object/template name be a link to the companion. Closes #4411. Review by extempore to make sure the design makes sense.
