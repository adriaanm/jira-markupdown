Specifically, I would like to be able to do the following:
```scala
val result = higherOrderMeth { implicit a: Int =>
  // do implicit-y things with a
}
```

As of 2.7.1, this triggers a parse error.  As far as I can tell, allowing this should not affect soundness and will not introduce any ambiguities in the grammar.

This capability is useful for situations like my implicit STM which uses function values which take implicit parameters.  Without this functionality, every function used in such a fashion must be declared as a full, named function.  This is ugly and too heavily drains the imagination (seeking unique identifiers).
