I must disagree. The problem is not with extending pkg2.A but with overriding its private[pkg2] member which is invisible in class B. If you treat qualified private as a generalization of Java's private then, by analogy to overriding private member in Java (which is not allowed), I should not be allowed to override private[C] outside of C. Anyway, let me cite Scala Reference (section 5.2):

<<<<<
The modifier can be qualified with an identifier C (e.g. private[C]) that must
denote a class or package enclosing the definition. Members labeled with
such a modifier are accessible respectively only from code inside the package
C or only from code inside the class C and its companion module (ï¿½5.4).
Such members are also inherited only from templates inside C.
>>>>>

I'm not sure what the last sentence mean (how can I inherit private[C] member from template not inside C? Such template cannot have private[C] member.), but certainly the remaining states that B cannot access A's private[pkg2] member.
