The cause of this is the following:

{code}
./reflect/scala/reflect/internal/util/StripMarginInterpolator.scala:    def isLi
neBreak(c: Char) = c == '\n' || c == '\f' // compatible with StringLike#isLineBr
eak
{code}

Presumably StringLike can't be changed, but it's still worth considering whether the compiler needs to follow this, esp. since the major editors don't (likewise the other major compilers, see below).
