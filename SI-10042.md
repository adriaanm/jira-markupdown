There is currently no way to check if a Java symbol is transient or not.

This is the case because {{scala.reflect.internal.ClassfileConstants}} does not translate the {{JAVA_ACC_TRANSIENT}} flag to a Scala flag. Therefore, checks with `{{hasFlag(Flags.TRANS_FLAG)}}` in symbols are negative for transitive variables in Java classes.

There is a [hack through reflection|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24125409/scala-macros-checking-if-a-java-field-is-marked-as-transient] that can be used to check this, but the fact that this case is not handled is bad for java interop and Serialization-intensive code.
{{TRANS_FLAG}} does not (and should not) correspond to {{JAVA_ACC_TRANSIENT}}: it is a special flag that can be used within a phase to pass information from one traversal to another. By convention, it should always be reset at the end of the phase.

In fact, there is no Scala flag that corresponds to {{JAVA_ACC_TRANSIENT}}. The same is also true for {{JAVA_ACC_VOLATILE}}, {{JAVA_ACC_NATIVE}}, probably others. The actual Scala equivalent for these is an annotation, so I think the classfile parser should add the corresponding annotation to the symbol. I don't think there's an existing example where this is being done.


For 2.12.1, it depends on the size / risk of the patch and how quickly it would be available for review. Also cc [~retronym], [~moors], do you think what I outlined above makes sense?
For consistency, we'll also have populate this annotation in our Java source file compiler, and in runtime reflection.

Looks like we forgot to create the `@throwable` annotation for runtime reflection Java method symbols, we should have added:
