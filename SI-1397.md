i have an in-scope implicit conversion for (=> Nothing) type but the compiler errors instead of applying it.

say i have these

implicit def byNameR2T(v: => R) = new T
implicit def byNameNothing2T(v: => Nothing) = new T

inside an object and then when I import the object to some other code I find that I can have the compiler perform the first conversion implicity but not the second.

in particular I'm trying to have the a view applied so that I can invoke say T.foo method after the conversion.
So
if
class R
then
(new R).foo works as i get the implicit conversion followed by apply of foo
but
say i have def g:Nothing = {throw new Exception}
(g).foo
will give
error: value foo is not a member of Nothing

Now I can understand that applying a conversion of "Nothing" to another type does not make sense,
because the Nothing value is never materialized.
And the Nothing being passed by value in the conversion function does not make sense.
However, a conversion function taking "Nothing" by name ( => Nothing) should be different.
Here the conversion should be applied as for all we know the conversion function may never actually uses the parameter (the by-name Nothing).
But still the compiler errors this.
I am using the 2.7.1final compiler and have not been able to try it on anything later.

Further evidence that this should be fixed is that I have no problem with implicit conversion of () => Nothing type.
In other words a very similar not-by-name functional type of Unit to Nothing type is handled by the compiler as expected.

note I asked the scala news group on this a couple weeks ago and no replies.
The reason i want this to work is that i have an actor-like library with a class having an andThen method. I want to be able to convert a by-name => Nothing subject into a class instance to invoke the andThen on that instance.
(very similar to actors but with better type checking)
I would actually say that it is a bug that implicits are allowed to distinguish on things that are call-by-name at all.  In particular inside the body of a method

{code}
def foo(arg : => Int) = { ... }
{code}

It is should not be possible for the programmer to distinguish between something with type Int and something with type => Int, so the implicit mechanism should not be allowed to do this either.

Furthermore, the fact that () => Nothing works is irrelevant because function types are something completely different from call-by-name arguments.  
Thinking about it further, the correct analogy is not that 
{code}
implicit def byNameNothing2T(v: => Nothing):T = new T 
{code}
should work if
{code}
implicit def byNameNothing2T(v: () => Nothing):T = new T 
{code}
works, but if 
{code}
implicit def byNameNothing2T(v: Nothing):T = new T 
{code}
works, which it doesn't.  So this has nothing at all to do with by-name arguments.  If you really think that implicit conversions should be apply to expressions of type Nothing, file another ticket for that instead.

In most systems with a bottom type, you are allowed to use something with type Nothing as if it had any possible field, among other things.  As such this would mean that there would be no point to using implicit conversions on expressions with type Nothing, because any possible projections or method invocation should already succeed without an implicit conversion.  

It might seem like one would never want a by-name Nothing to be implicitly converted, but that's exactly what I needed.
I have written a library that is very similar to Scala actors Actor object yet for a simpler domain.
My library react method returns Nothing just like the Actor class.
Where i differ slightly is that my "mkBody" library method is
not parameterized like the one in scala Actors but has type

implicit def mkBody(body: => Nothing):Body = new Body(() => body)

so the compiler sees the mkBody has a by-name Nothing method such that if it would perform the same type of implicit conversion as happens with scala Actor code

  implicit def mkBody[a](body: => a) = new Body[a] {
    def andThen[b](other: => b): Unit = self.seq(body, other)
  }

then similarly users of my library could do stuff like

X.react { ... } andThen { more code }

where the andThen is a method of the Body type.

If the compiler is going to insist on treating => Nothing as not allowed for implicit conversion, then I guess I'm going to have to try to trick the compiler perhaps with a parameterization ala Scala actors or with Any type or something. ??
I didnt think I should need to do this as => Nothing is the only possible thing I want to "wrap" in an implicit conversion.

Now, if => Nothing implicit conversions are really meant to be disallowed, then shouldn't the language spec state something about it.
Actually, if one just fixed the compiler to not error the case out, I dont see this breaking anything else -- you would get the implicit conversion applied. (But certainly I'm just a naive user and not at all familiar with the scala compiler).

Anyway thanks you guys for the consideration.

There is a big difference in these two as the scala Actor library and my library shows. The by-name Nothing is advertising some later computation that via a conversion could be wrapped inside an object via an implicit conversion.

You can disagree that 1 + 1 should be 2 as well, but that doesn't change the fact that the language cannot be consistent if implicits distinguished between T and => T.  The correct way to advertise that it is returning a "computation" is to actually have it return a "Computation" type.  Returning Nothing is advertising that it *DOES NOT RETURN*.  Furthermore, if Scala treated Nothing correctly to begin with, an implicit conversion would never be applicable because all projections and method calls should already succeed on the Nothing type.  


> And if you look at scala Actor libray, the react method returns Nothing type so there is precedent for it and obvious usefulness for it. It does more than signal to the user that the method does not return. The compiler checks that code following a react method is in error, something that i want checked to prevent bugs.

Well, if I look at the actor's library I see loopWhile and andThen are implemented without implicit conversions on Nothing.  So it does not really support your argument.

And if you use a proper "Computation" type the compiler will also report type mismatches for you as well.  So again, using Nothing gains you nothing.  You need to learn to use the type system to your advantage and using Nothing does not properly describe your intent.

Well of course the actors library could not have implicit conversions on => Nothing, when the compiler wont compile it.

The actors lib authors would have wanted the mkBody implicit conversion to have worked with this one but as you see it doesn't for the same reason as this ticket.

scala> Actor.actor { import Actor._; react { case _ => } andThen { 0 } }
<console>:9: error: value andThen is not a member of Nothing
       Actor.actor { import Actor._; react { case _ => } andThen { 0 } }

So, if you want the implicit conversion you have to wrap the react in something that will accept Nothing but return something else like Unit. And it just so happens that the mkBody implicit conversion will be applied on => Unit type (and probably most any type different than Nothing, => Nothing, etc).

ok, Here I'll create the simplest wrapper (simpler than loop, loopWhile in actor library as these have other side effects):

scala> def bar(b: => Unit):Unit = b
bar: (=> Unit)Unit

then i get the implicit conversion I wanted all along with bar wrapping the react.

scala> Actor.actor { import Actor._; bar {react { case _ => }} andThen { 0 }}
res7: scala.actors.Actor = scala.actors.Actor$$$$anon$$1@144426c

The point is that one should not have to trick the compiler and "wrap" the Nothing to some other type so as to get a by-Name implicit conversion.
And via the "bar" function you can see that I did get the actors by-name implicit conversion to occur on the "Nothing" result of react.


Finally my use of Nothing is with the same intent as the actors library, so your advice if it made sense would also apply to the Scala actors library authors who have made thorough use of Nothing as a return type.
In my case I wanted to improve the type checking some more and instead of many of the => Unit paramters, I thought => Nothing would better check/describe my need.

If you use Nothing, the type system cannot help you because you aren't telling it what you're doing, which is building and composing a special kind of computation.   But no matter how many times I point this out you don't seem to listen, so I'm not going to bother with you or this ticket any further.  

I appreciate all the points you are making but they are not making sense to me. of course, It could be me here.
However if Scala language & compiler authors want to convince people of when/how to use Nothing type properly and the relation to implicit conversions, then there is a need to make this information known in the Language Specification first, then the books, then also in the standard libraries. In the meantime it would seem users will keep getting surprised as I have.
What I end up doing is creating a loopWhileCont method which explicity performs my => Nothing conversion & otherwise I think I'm happy with Nothing type at this point in my lib design/usage.
Will I follow your advice to move away from Nothing at later time -- not until I see the advantages/disadvantages in favor of it.
(Of course if i see a redesigned actors library with your recommendations and its advantages then i might reconsider also.)
