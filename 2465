I have tried to dig in the problem but felt lost in collections jungle. On this way I have found strange code fragment in swing/BufferWrapper.scala:

{code}
protected[swing] abstract class BufferWrapper[A] extends Buffer[A] { outer =>
    def clear { for (i <- 0 to length) remove(0) }
    def update(n: Int, a: A) {
        remove(0)
        insertAt(n, a)
    }
...
...
}
{code}
I mean '0' instead of 'n' in 'remove(0)' call. OTOH, I still didn't found any relation of this possible typo with the bug (I have tried to replace '0' with 'n' with the same CCE as a result).
