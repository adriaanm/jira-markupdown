{code}
scala> case class wrong(`a b`: Int, a: Int)
defined class wrong

scala> wrong(1, 2)
res6: wrong = wrong(1,1)

scala> .`a b`
res7: Int = 1

scala> res6.a
res8: Int = 1

scala> .`a beans
{code}
Plus, code completion tab after the b yields what you see here.

But there's an issue for backticks in REPL.
