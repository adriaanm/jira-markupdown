Although, I can get an "unchecked" warning now. :-\

Is there a ticket for getting rid of the "explicitly-annotated types" requirement?  Declarations like these remind me of Java:
```scala
implicit def encode[A](implicit A: EncodeJson[A]): EncodeJson[Success[A]] = EncodeJson[Success[A]](...)
```

OTOH, I guess it's not too hard to work around if the rule you mentioned is the only one, "the typechecker may ignore [implicits] from preceding parts of the same source file".  I just never knew this rule, and it felt very Heisenbuggy.

Thanks again.
