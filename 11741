Thanks --- I'm using whatever version(s) my work desktop (Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS --- unfortunately that's still our preferred company version) provides by default.  Having hit another similar problem, I'll uninstall the version ubuntu provides (which identifies itself as "Scala code runner version 2.9.1 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL", and try installing the latest from scala-lang.org.
