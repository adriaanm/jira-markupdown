{code}
val rand = new scala.util.Random()
{code}

This works fine

{code}
val a = rand.shuffle(0 to 5)
{code}

But this gives an error:

{code}
val a = rand.shuffle(0 until 5)
<console>:9: error: Cannot construct a collection of type scala.collection.AbstractSeq[Int] with elements of type Int based on a collection of type scala.collection.AbstractSeq[Int].
       val a = rand.shuffle(0 until 5)
{code}
Here's a slightly more isolated look at the problem:

{code}
import collection.generic._

object Test {
  def shuffle[T, CC[X] <: TraversableOnce[X]]
             (xs: CC[T])
             (implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[CC[T], T, CC[T]]): CC[T] = null.asInstanceOf[CC[T]]

  def foo1(r: R1) = shuffle(r)                  // fail
  def foo2(r: R1) = shuffle(r: IndexedSeq[Int]) // okay
  def foo3(r: R2) = shuffle(r)                  // okay

  abstract class AbstractSeq[+A] extends collection.Seq[A]

  abstract class R1
  extends AbstractSeq[Int]
     with IndexedSeq[Int]

  abstract class R2 extends IndexedSeq[Int]
}
{code}

The intermediate class, {{AbstractSeq}}, is new in 2.10.0. It seems that the implicit search isn't looking deeper than the first parent of R1. This test file also fails in 2.9.2, which tells me this isn't a regression in type inference, but rather an existing bug/limitation which has been exposed by the change in the collection hierarchy.
Adriaan: assigning to you to contemplate the fix and fix version.

AFAICT, the only fix we could deliver in 2.10.1 would be an improved type inference, which of course is also not without risk (one man's treasure is another man's trash.)

While I'm happy to live with {{rand.shuffle((0 until 5).toList)}} for the reported bug, I'm worried that the inclusion of {{AbstractXxx}} will lead to a trickle of these problems being reported.
I've analysed this, from the commit comment:

In a0a045f, a variety of abstract classes were inserted
into the collections hierarchy to centralize the instantiation
of traits, and thereby shed a few pounds from the JAR size.

These appear to have been carefully added into the right
place in the linearization order, and were kept private,
so it was hard to forsee any downside.

Turns out there was a small downside: type constructor
inference doesn't start by walking up the base type sequence,
instead it first tries the direct parents. This is done
in See TypeVar#registerBound.

For most collections this subtlety isn't visible, as
they typically match the kind CC[x] <: TraversableOnce[x],
and the search of the parents doesn't happen.

But for types like BitSet, Range, and WrappedString,
type inference must work up the heirarchy to find
a suitable type constructor. Not, it finds the newly
inserted AbstractSeq or the like, infers this, and
subsequently fails to find a corresponing CanBuildFrom.

    rand: scala.util.Random = scala.util.Random@7adc28b

    scala> rand.shuffle(collection.immutable.BitSet(1))

I wrapped my head around this on the plane today when I ran smack into it. It is a big problem for my plans. We have to fix it one way or the other. And my test case is a regression from 2.9. Clearly it was going to hit us one way or another, but it's still a regression.
{code}
import scala.collection.immutable.BitSet
import scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom

object Test {
  def builder[A, CC[X] <: TraversableOnce[X], Coll](xs: Coll with CC[A] with AnyRef)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[_, A, CC[A]]) = cbf()

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println(builder(null: BitSet) += 1 result)
  }
}
{code}

It's a crime that this is still in play. It would be REALLY EASY to make the stupid AbstractFoo classes public. Especially since it seems type inference will never be fixed. Think of what this does to someone trying to write oh I don't know some collections.

This is completely nuts! Do you really want to ship another major version which a) cannot figure out not to infer types which you can't access and b) does so reliably in common situations?
{code}

scala> def f[A, CC[X]](xs: CC[A]) = xs
warning: there were 1 feature warning(s); re-run with -feature for details
f: [A, CC[X]](xs: CC[A])CC[A]

scala> f(BitSet(1))
res0: scala.collection.AbstractSet[Int] = BitSet(1)

scala> var x: scala.collection.AbstractSet[Int] = res0
<console>:21: error: class AbstractSet in package collection cannot be accessed in package collection
       var x: scala.collection.AbstractSet[Int] = res0
                               ^
{code}

And again it's a regression from 2.9.
I'll also note that the AbstractXxx base classes have exposed us to the worst of SI-3452 (reported as SI-7374). Mixing in the trait forwarders at the leaves, where `Repr` is concrete, means that the Java generic signatures are closer to coherent. On its own, that's probably not enough to give up the reductions in bytecode size. But in combination with this problem (hk unification doesn't respect the base-type-seq, so a new parent changed type inference), and also the problem that Paul mentions that inference makes no attempt to infer accessible types, maybe there is an argument to remove them altogether?
Removing them might be a tough sell, given that all three of the reasons to remove them are scala bugs. I think removing them would be a devastating blow to scala on android.  And it was something like 1.4 megabytes savings, which people have presumably normalized, so removing them would amount to donating that much to the library in preference to doing something about those bugs.

I don't know, I'm not the guy to weigh those tradeoffs. I think removing them entirely is probably unwise, but I doubt there are any hail marys coming to fix any of the issues before 2.11. I'll send a PR removing the access limitations.

In case anyone is thinking they don't want to make those classes public because it increases the binary compatibility surface area, I have some bad news: thanks to the leaking of those supposed-to-be-internal types, they're already in the footprint.
{code}
object Test {
  def f[A, CC[X]](xs: CC[A]) = xs
  def g = f(scala.collection.immutable.BitSet(1))
}
// public <A extends java/lang/Object, CC extends java/lang/Object> CC f(CC);
//   Signature: (Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;

// public scala.collection.AbstractSet<java.lang.Object> g();
//   Signature: ()Lscala/collection/AbstractSet;
{code}

In other words there is no such thing as a private type.
