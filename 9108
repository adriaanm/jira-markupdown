I wasn't suggesting making mapValues strict. I was suggesting to write the result when serializing (Getting something not identical, but equal when deserializing). 
I think serialization of non strict collection is a fundamental issue, exasperated in this case when the type system gives us no hint to the problem. 
I think materializing when serializing is not a bad behavior, the only alternative I can think of is trying to serialize the function optimistically (many serialize just fine). 
Materializing on serialization might be less clean, but it is far more useful, especially for novices who want things to "just work".
