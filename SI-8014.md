Ready for this? This is a good one.

```
scala> Vector() ++ Iterator(1)
res9: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector(1)

scala> Vector() ++ Iterator(1, 2)
res10: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector(1, 2)

scala> Vector() ++ Iterator(1, 2, 3)
res11: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[Int] = Vector()
```

was fine in 2.11.0-M5.

I can't seem to find another combination of types besides Vector + Iterator on which it fails
OlegYch and datura on #scala figured out the culprit appears to be https://github.com/scala/scala/commit/4234b34dd4e6563ba8a9b5080cc6a0da021848d3#diff-59f3462485b74027de4fd5e9febcc81b from the fix for #7725. `case _ => super.\+\+(that)` should be `case _ => super.\+\+(again)`
