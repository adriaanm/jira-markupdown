Scaladoc should be able to generate links to external scaladoc and javadoc sites for types that appear in method signatures and are not defined in the user's project. The user should be able to provide the locations of those sites via a command line argument (see the [http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javadoc.html#standard -link] javadoc option).

Ideally scaladoc should try to be compatible with javadoc so that javadoc generated links for extenal javadoc sites correctly resolve to Scala documentation pages (requires changes to the filenames generated by scaladoc).
