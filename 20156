Methods as intercept and diff for Collections and String Objects not returning correct value.
For simulate the problem execute that test:
```scala
/**
 * Issue in methods diff and intercept for classes String and Collections
 * 
 * For tests execute that sample with:
 * 
 * In with diff: ("SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" diff "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS") length
 * Out Should to be: 5  BUT RESPONSE HERE IS 3.
 * 
 * In with intersect: "SOSSSSSSSSSSSSO" intersect "SOSSOSSOSSOSSOS" 
 * Out Should to be: "SOSSSSSSSS" BUT RESPONSE HERE IS "SOSSOSSSSSSS" 
 *

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val sc = io.Source.stdin.getLines
    val S = sc.next();
    val s = "SOS"*(S.length/3)
    println((s diff S) length)
    println(s intersect S)
  }
}
```
