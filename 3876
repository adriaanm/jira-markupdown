I copied the code from above and it compiled and ran using the following commands...
```scala
adam@laptop:~/progs/scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin$$ ./scalac bug.scala
adam@laptop:~/progs/scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin$$ ./scala Bug
Set(null, F2)
```

Here's the verbose version...
```scala
adam@laptop:~/progs/scala-2.8.0.RC1/bin$$ ./scalac -verbose bug.scala
