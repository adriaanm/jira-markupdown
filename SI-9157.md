As reported https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/wdQVas4jNdc/vzLp2uOdITsJ
/cc [~viktorklang] [~roland.kuhn] [~bjorn.antonsson] It might be worth applying the workaround (alias expanion) to the Flow DSL until we can find a fix for this in the compiler.
Still digging.

Here's a smaller repro:

{code}
trait Flow[-In, +Out] {
  type Repr[+O] <: Flow[In, O]
  def map: Repr[String]
}

class Test {
  def slowFlow(f: Flow[String,String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]#Repr[String]) = {
    f.map
  }
}
{code}

As [~odersky] noted on the mailing list, this typechecks promptly in dotty. We've must have some exponential performance bug in scalac.
Counting the calls to `TypeRef#relativeInfo` with an increasing number of type projections:

{noformat}
% qscalac sandbox/test.scala  | grep Repr | wc -l
      26
     326
    3336
   33446
  334556
{noformat}
[~retronym], I am glad you can built short example to reproduce the issue. If you need full sources please fell free to contact
If it's the same bug I reported six months ago you can't collect the immediate fix bounty. Still no comment on that one: SI-8801

The preference of just-reported bugs over long neglected bugs creates all the wrong incentives. I should probably close my 142 open tickets and re-open them one per day over the next five months.

I don't think it's fair to expect we unmask every single duplicate. Thanks for reporting first as well as pointing out our oversight, though.
This new report came from a project that we knew was blocked by this, so it got fixed.

What are these wrong incentives you speak of? Not to look for existing bugs when reporting a new one? We're just going to have to accept we won't be able to fix all the open bugs with the resources we have, let alone keep all the tickets in our heads to spot duplicates as readily as you do. 

In the end, this is like a "jira chapter 11", a soft version of the bankruptcy idea that was floated on twitter not too long ago, except that declaring such "defeat" explicitly (which we have discussed internally multiple times) would probably be met with "ha! they imploded!" cheers if it came from us.

I do understand your frustration, and wish we could address it, but I really don't see the point of all this negativity given that we are already doing the best we can.

My JIRA expertise remains about where it was, but I can tell you how many there are with brute force after dumping the list to html.
{code}
% ack --literal '&nbsp;<font color="#ffffff"><b>Description</b></font>&nbsp;' me.html  |wc
     141     282   10152
% ack --literal '&nbsp;<font color="#ffffff"><b>Comments</b></font>&nbsp;' me.html  |wc
     114     228    7866
{code}
So 27. Okay, with a variation on that I get the coarse look:
{code}
% ack -o '^\s+\[SI-\d+\]|<b>Comments</b>|<b>Description</b>' me.html
{code}
And I can never remember how to accomplish multi-line stuff via sed and friends so I just manually deleted it down to the ones without comments.

Must have one straggler in there since that's 28.
I've added your test from SI-8801: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4347

Always happy to kill N birds with M stones where N > M, but I agree it would be better to avoid duplicate birds from taking flight in the first place. I do close a *lot* of new tickets as duplicates, but don't find the old ones, and sometimes forget to look. Thankfully in this case the minimization and fix were both surprisingly forthcoming.

I'll take a look through that list, too. 
In case anyone is actually considering commenting on my orphan tickets, I have completed an extremely depressing tour of them and here are the results:

In addition to the 28 entirely uncommented tickets noted above, these are "effectively uncommented" as their only comments are from me, from various third parties, and/or from Joe Jirabot with "Unassigning and rescheduling to M6 as previous deadline was missed" or some variation thereof.

Here are a couple where I feel the conversation was left unreasonably hanging.

Seeing all 140 of those tickets one after another, I had a glimpse of what it must have been like to be a civil war battlefield medic. Fighting for the South.
