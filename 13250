Suggested additions to Function1 to allow right-associative composition and application.

Example usage:
```scala
val f = {x: Int => x + 1}
val g = {x: Int => x * 2}
val h = {x: Int => x + 0.5}

val j = f ->: g ->: h   // Same as (f andThen g andThen h)
val result = 4 ->: f ->: g ->: h    // Same as (f andThen g andThen h)(4)
```
