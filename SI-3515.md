Reason: In the definition of collection.immutable.Stream.Cons

{code}
  final class Cons[+A](hd: A, tl: => Stream[A]) extends Stream[A] {
    override def isEmpty = false
    override def head = hd
    private[this] var tlVal: Stream[A] = _
    def tailDefined = tlVal ne null
    override def tail: Stream[A] = {
      if (!tailDefined) { tlVal = tl }
      tlVal 
    }
  }
{code}

there is no locking meachanism, and tl may be executed
multiple times for the same position in the Stream.

Demonstration: The following script

{code}
import actors.Futures._

def rndStream: Stream[Int] = Stream.cons(
  { Thread.sleep(200); util.Random.nextInt(99) },
  rndStream
)

val s = rndStream.take(10)
val (fa, fb) = ( future {s.toList}, future {s.toList} )

println( fa() )
println( fb() )
{code}

Produces an output like this:
{code}
List(79, 44, 10, 86, 49, 37, 78, 12, 62, 68)
List(79, 67, 98, 87, 15, 52, 67, 86, 35, 32)
{code}


Proposed solution: Make tail a lazy val, e.g. like this

{code}
final class Cons[+A](hd: A, tl: => Stream[A]) extends Stream[A] {
  override def isEmpty = false
  override val head = hd
  @volatile var tailDefined = false
  override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = {
    tailDefined = true
    tl
  }
}
{code}


Demo:

{code}
import actors.Futures._

final class Cons[+A](hd: A, tl: => Stream[A]) extends Stream[A] {
  override def isEmpty = false
  override val head = hd
  @volatile var tailDefined = false
  override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = {
    tailDefined = true
    tl
  }
}

def rndStream: Stream[Int] = new Cons(
  { Thread.sleep(100); util.Random.nextInt(99) },
  rndStream
)

val s = rndStream.take(10)
val (fa, fb) = ( future {s.toList}, future {s.toList} )

println( fa() )
println( fb() )
{code}

produces something like this:

{code}
List(98, 46, 77, 46, 94, 32, 33, 50, 40, 56)
List(98, 46, 77, 46, 94, 32, 33, 50, 40, 56)
{code}

While Stream is not specified to be thread-safe in the API docs, Scala's
immutable collections are usually expected to be (since inherent
thread-safety is one of their major strengths). So i propose to classify
this as a defect.

I'd vote to include this in 2.8.0.RC4, if accepted.

System information, for completeness:

This is a duplicate of SI-1220, where you will also find why the lazy val idea doesn't work, and my comment as to how it could in theory.
Whoops - I'm very very sorry, should have seen that!

Still, the ideas in SI-1220 look very similar to my approach with the

{code}
  @volatile var tailDefined = false
  override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = { tailDefined = true; tl }
{code}

So why shouldn't that work? Do I miss something here?

Uh, better make that

{code}
  def tailDefined: Boolean = tailDefinedVar
  @volatile protected var tailDefinedVar = false
  override lazy val tail: Stream[A] = { tailDefinedVar = true; tl }
{code}

to keep the public interface immutable.

That would work as far as I know, I realize the side trip into knowing whether lazy val has unthunked is something of a side trip.  But it's very very late in the game for 2.8 and this has survived since SI-1220 so it can survive a little longer: short of martin saying otherwise this won't be fixed for 2.8.
Damn, I had big plans for Actors, Streams and I/O, wish a had stumbled on this earlier. ;-)

I'll understand if this change goes to deep this late in the RC phase, though.
