Don't blame the whole team. I abandoned scala because I feel exactly the same way. I have given that speech essentially verbatim ("fix it or remove it - it is ridiculously unprofessional to knowingly ship broken code", etc.) probably a dozen times over the last few years. Never made any difference: scala still ships all the same broken code. Much of it has been broken in the same way since I started working on scala, that being when 2.7.5 was the current release.

For instance: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-debate/M8s8FmASL8Y

Trust me when I say DelayedInit is way, way, way down the list of things which are known to be broken and which will not be fixed.
