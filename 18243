After a transformation of selectDynamic the position for the transformed method is not correctly set. For example
```scala
object X {
  val d = new D
  d.method
}
import language.dynamics
class D extends Dynamic {
  def selectDynamic(name: String) = name
}
```

results in (with "scalac -Yrangepos -Xprint-pos -Xprint:parser,typer")
```scala
//after parser
    [29:37]d.method

//after typer
    [29:30][29:30][29]X.this.d.selectDynamic([29]"method")
```

where the 29 before the string argument in selectDynamic is wrong.

This was discussed before at https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/RgHUcvfh9aU/discussion. Jason also did a quick fix.
