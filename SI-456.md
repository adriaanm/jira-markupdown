Hi,

I've upgraded to scala 2.7.0-rc1 and I noticed a very strange compiler error involving case classes. It's not clear to me why it happens but I was able to reduce the problem into two very small files. I will attach them to the bug. Interestingly, if you put both classes into the same file, the problem does not occur.

The error is the following:

[INFO] Compiling 2 source files to /home/ijuma/workspace/target/classes
[WARNING] /home/ijuma/workspace/src/test/Bar.scala:5: error: illegal inheritance;
[WARNING]  self-type test.Bar.type does not conform to (Double, Double, Double, Double, Map[String,Double]) => test.Bar's selftype (Double, Double, Double, Double, Map[String,Double]) => test.Bar
[WARNING] case class Bar(double0: Double, double1: Double, double2: Double, double3: Double,
[WARNING]            ^
[WARNING] one error found
This was fixed in scala 2.7.0-rc2. I think it may have been fixed by r13948 (like ticket SI-458), but not sure.
