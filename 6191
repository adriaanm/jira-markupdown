I tested it in the recompiled scala 2.10 version and everything seems to work.
Alt-Plus, Alt-Zero and normal Alt keycodes worked and also right mouse pasting and ctrl + v pasting worked without garbage characters.

Just be sure that DejaVu Sans Mono is selected because sometimes windows defaults to Lucida Console font when creating in another directory a new console.

Recompiling scala was difficult because if the settings of -Xmx was to high the jvm was not created and if too low then during creation of scaladoc I had a outofheapspace memory error. Fortunately the binaries were already created so I could test.

chcp 65001 in the console is not really necessary. It worked also when chcp is 850.

jline.jar also works in 2.9.0.1 so recompiling scala was not necessary or is there a special reason to use the latest version of scala? jline.jar looks backward compatible.
