(prewarning: I understand nothing in an Eclipse plugins development)

Digging in the plugin code and call chains  (with multiple printlns and rebuildings), I have found (at least I think so) the place causing the bug. The call chain is:

{code}
TypersPresentations 'def hyperlink' 
TypersPresentations decode(symbol : Symbol)
ScalaPlugin fileFor(sym : Symbol)
ScalaPlugin findFileFor(file : PlainFile)
{code}

In the last method finding takes place again *workspace* root dir. 

Hope, it will move the bug to trivial issue :-)
