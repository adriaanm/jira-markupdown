Thanks for the pointers, Paul. I don't see how this prevents us from fixing at least the casts on numbers which are non-null. But it is true that Scala's null semantics seem pretty much broken.
Being a young, naive and still motivated Scala hacker, I haven't lost hope we can fix that. I try to do some thinking and post in scala/bug#4437. Any additional comments or pointers to use cases and thoughts are welcome.
