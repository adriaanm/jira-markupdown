{code}
case class B(var x: Int) {
  def succ() {
    x = x + 1
  }
}

object TestFoo {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val b = B(0)
    b match {
      case B(x) =>
        //println(x)
        b.succ()
        println(x)
    }
  }
}
{code}

This code prints "1" instead of "0". However if you uncomment first println you will get what expected "0\n0".
@adriaanm rather than tinkering around this to extract the non-val case class parameters eagerly, I think we should just revert to using {{B.unapply}}.
By optimized, I just meant avoiding the call to {{unapply}} for a case class. 

+1 for local variables. 

Adriaan: do you plan to add locals for bound names that are used in the body, or for all bound names? The latter would be convenient while debugging.
One more convenience for us dirty debuggers:

{code}
scrut match {
  case (Foo(x, y), _) =>
    // generate a var for constructor patterns
    val foo$1: Foo

    // in addition to the user provided binders
    val x: Int
    val y: String
}
{code}
