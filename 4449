I am beyond embarrassed that it took me so long to see the cause of this bug, and Paul even pointed to the very code I was looking at as the source of the problem... In ./src/library/scala/collection/immutable/PagedSeq.scala, the following code does not set isFirst to false under the correct conditional.  As a result, it never changes to false, and no newline characters are added to the beginning of each String.
{code}
  /** Constructs a character sequence from a line iterator
   *  Lines do not contain trailing `\n' characters; The method inserts
   *  a line separator `\n' between any two lines in the sequence.
   */
  def fromLines(source: Iterator[String]): PagedSeq[Char] = {
    var isFirst = true
    fromStrings(source map { line =>
      if (isFirst) line 
      else { 
        isFirst = false
        "\n"+line
      }
    }) 
  }      
{code}
As a result, fromLines will always result in the same result as fromStrings.
