I like the idea of having more information about the collection bounds when the exception is thrown, it would have been useful to me in the past. However, there are probably performance tradeoffs:

* Can we always know the size of the collection in constant _extra_ time? I can't think of any situation where that's not possible, but I may be missing some contrived case;
* Even if it's not worse in big-O notation, some extra counting and other work may be needed when the collection size can't be known in constant-time (e.g. in `LinearSeq`). Also, a bigger string with some string appends will have to be built.

I'm willing to take on this, if you think it's a good idea. [~ichoran], what do you think? Is it worth it performance-wise?
