Right, nobody's test cases seem particularly self-contained but yesterday I minimized my way to one which definitely works on 2.10.0 and for which the commit I cited was when it stopped working post-2.10 (but it doesn't work in 2.9 either.) Here is another which fits that description:
{code}
class LM {
  class Node[B1]
  case class CC(x: LM)

  // crash
  val g: (CC => Any) = {
    case CC(tttt) =>
      // tttt.##
      new tttt.Node[Any]()
  }
}
{code}
{noformat}
% scalac-hash 494ba94518^ z.scala 
% scalac-hash 494ba94518 z.scala 
error: symbol value tttt does not exist in LM.<init>
error: uncaught exception during compilation: scala.reflect.internal.FatalError
error: scala.reflect.internal.FatalError: 
{noformat}
