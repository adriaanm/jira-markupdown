I tend to agree that this is a bug, because given the import statement, the implicit should be made available -- however in case you are unaware, in general implicits which lexically follow the point at which you want them to work need an explicit return type to be considered.  And this example does work if you supply it.
{code}
  implicit def ax(a: A): AX = new AX
{code}
