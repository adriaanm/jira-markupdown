This is worse than something obscure like final var.  The following class generates a public field for i if compiled with -Yinline.
```scala
final class D(val i: Int) { 
  def f = i*2
}
// public final int i;
```
On the other hand the example in the ticket doesn't generate a runtime error anymore, because apparently nothing is inlined.  Which is either another bug (I am having a lot of trouble matching up what I imagine the inliner to do with what I see it doing) or some penetrating insight on its part.
