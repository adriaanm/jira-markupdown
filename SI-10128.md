[{{PartiallyOrdered}} is a non-universal trait](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.12.1/src/library/scala/math/PartiallyOrdered.scala#L19), though it seems like it could be made one "for free".

I ran into this while trying to make a value-class that extends `PartiallyOrdered`.
I ported `PartiallyOrdered` to [org.hammerlab:iterator](https://github.com/hammerlab/iterator) ([mvn central link](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.hammerlab%22%20iterator)) and made it extend `Any` as a work-around.

I just tried to open the scala repo to send a PR but the IntelliJ scala plugin threw errors trying to load it, will look in to filing that elsewhere ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯
