This does not compile in 2.10, but does in master.
{code}
class Foo { def f = 5 }
class Bar extends Foo { private def f = 10 }
{code}
I think it regressed in e609f1f20b . The test case run/private-override.scala looks wrong - class Other is supposed to be in some package other than p2 to test what it is intending to test. I believe that bug is legit, just the test case is wrong, but also that it is the change which accompanied it which caused the bug being reported here.
For reference, the Java behaviour is like ours in 2.10:

{code}
tail sandbox/{Test,Sub}.java
==> sandbox/Test.java <==
class Test {
	public int foo() { return 0; }
}

==> sandbox/Sub.java <==
class Sub extends Test {
	private int foo() { return 0; }
}
  /code/scala javac sandbox/{Test,Sub}.java
sandbox/Sub.java:2: foo() in Sub cannot override foo() in Test; attempting to assign weaker access privileges; was public
	private int foo() { return 0; }
	            ^
1 error
{code}
Note that slight variations are allowed even in 2.10 and prior.
{code}
class A { def f = 5 }
class B extends A { private[B] def f = 10 }
{code}
Not sure how that can be acceptable if straight private isn't.
Good catch.

Seems like every call to `Symbol#isPrivate` represents a potential bug:

{code}
scala> object O { trait T { private[O] def foo = 0 } }
defined module O

scala> val foo = typeOf[O.T].member(newTermName("foo"))
foo: $r.intp.global.Symbol = method foo

scala> foo.isPrivate
res0: Boolean = false

scala> foo.privateWithin
res1: $r.intp.global.Symbol = object O
{code}

{code}
// RefChecks
if (member.isPrivate) // (1.1)
            overrideError("has weaker access privileges; it should not be private")
          member.privateWithin
{code}
