I started with the following two methods:

```java
def getName: String = getString match {
  case None => return ""
  case Some(str) => return str
}

def getString: Option[String] = Some("abc")
```

Then I changed the first method to

```java
lazy val getName: String = getString match {
  case None => return ""
  case Some(str) => return str
}
```

Unfortunately, I forgot to remove the return statement. In this case, scala compiler should stop with the message "return outside method definition", but what it really did was:

error: uncaught exception during compilation: java.lang.NullPointerException
It's not only erroneous code which crashes (i.e. "return outside method definition") either:
```scala
class A {
  def f: String = {
    lazy val s: String = return ""
    ""
  }
}
```
```

commit 4c86dbbc49
Author: Hubert Plociniczak <hubert.plociniczak@gmail.com>
Date:   7 months ago

    Closes SI-6358. Move accessor generation for lazy vals to typers.

    Until now lazy accessors were handled somehow special because their symbol
was created in typers but the corresponding tree was only added in Refchecks.
This irregularity caused serious problem s for value classes. Also it now looks
just better when lazy value is treated in a similar way as other fields.

    I needed to adapt reifier so that it handles the new implementation
correctly. Previously it had to recreate lazy val only by removing defdef and
renaming. Now we basically need to recreate laz y val from scratch.

    There is one minor change to cps plugin but that is still fine because lazy
vals were never really part of the transformation.

    Some range positions needed to be fixed manually. We could do it at the
creation time but that would require a lot more "if (symbol.isLazy)" conditions
for MethodSyntheis and Symbol/Tree creati on and would just unnecessary
complicate api. If someone has a better idea, please speak up. Range positions
changes were necessary because previously accessors were created at refchecks
and they w eren't checked by validator (even though they were wrong).

    This commit removes lazy val implementation restriction introduced for
    2.10.0. (cherry-picked from 981424b)
```
I just fixed this as the independently reported #8245, so I'm marking this as duplicate.
