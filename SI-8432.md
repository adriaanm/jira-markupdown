The following regression occurs in Scala 2.11.0-RC3 versus 2.10.3

{code}
trait Foo {
  trait X {
    def bar(y: Y): Unit = y.baz()

    private def baz() = ()
  }

  trait Y extends X
}
{code}

This compiles in 2.10.3. In 2.11.0-RC3, you get

{code}
[error] .../Foo.scala:5: value baz is not a member of Foo.this.Y
[error]     def bar(y: Y): Unit = y.baz()
{code}

See SI-7475, this was actually a bug fix. It's a bit non-intuitive, but we determined it was the right course of action.

You need to explicitly upcast:

{code}
   (y: X).baz()
{code}
