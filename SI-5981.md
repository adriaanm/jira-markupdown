The source code for {{Failure.recover}}, {{Success.collect}}, {{Success.exists}}, and {{Success.filter}} contain unguarded boolean tests with either a predicate function or a partial function's {{isDefinedAt}}.

The exception-safety of the code could be improved if these were each wrapped in try-catch blocks, unless the desire is for these things to throw exceptions.  If the behavior is not improved, the documentation should clearly state that throwing exceptions is expected behavior.
