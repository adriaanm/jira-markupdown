Rich - Give this a try:
```scala
import scala.actors.Actor._
import scala.actors.TIMEOUT

object Test1 {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    println("main-1")
    actor {
      println("actor-1")
      reactWithin(2000) {
	case TIMEOUT => println("actor-2")
      }
    }
    println("main-2")
  }
}
```
Then compile & run it (this is with 2.7.4):
```scala
$$ scalac Test1.scala
$$ scala -cp . Test1
main-1
main-2
actor-1
actor-2
```
I think the problem is that the script runner calls System.exit() when the script finishes, so it doesn't matter if there are still living threads.
