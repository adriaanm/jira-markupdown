After a Project->Clean, all the class files appears in the same folder of the scala files, ignoring the "output folder" configured in the build path.

eclipse.buildId=M20090917-0800
java.version=1.6.0_16
plugin=2.8.0.r20121-b20091214042857



I cannot reproduce this bug in r20121.

Both my existing maven projects and a Scala project that I created respect the output folder settings defined in the build-path configuration.
Hi.  

I tried with a fresh project and I found that the "bug" was misreported, sorry for the noise. I've, somehow, got the class files in the source folders (maybe by a prior bug?) and I didn't notice it.   

Regards,

Germï¿½n
