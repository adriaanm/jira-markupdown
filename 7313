The [comment on the puzzler](https://github.com/scalapuzzlers/scalapuzzlers.github.com/pull/116#discussion_r23472649) was that this is [another issue](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-8884).

In the U.S., you get three years to amend a tax return and three years to amend a community contribution.
```
But if you're lucky, it won't get fixed before the second edition of the puzzlers book.
```

However, that should have read:
```
You're lucky if Jason doesn't notice the issue, assign it to himself and fix it before Scala Days. 
Or rather, at Scala Days during lunch the day of your presentation. Or maybe during the five
minutes you give people to figure out what's going on.
```
