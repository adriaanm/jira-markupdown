Currently, (-0d).signum returns -1. I would expect this to return 0. For reference, the following works fine:

assert(scala.math.signum(-0d) == 0)
assert(java.lang.Math.signum(-0d) == 0)

But this blows up:

assert((-0d).signum == 0)

I am aware you want to follow Java's java.lang.Double.compare for Ordering (which strangely believes 0 * -1.0 < 0.0), but in this case I believe we should follow math/Math.signum's lead.

I think this would require overriding signum in DoubleIsConflicted from Numeric.scala.
This is fixed in the 2.10.0 M3:
```scala
scala> scala.math.signum(-0d)
res0: Double = 0.0

scala> java.lang.Math.signum(-0d)
res1: Double = -0.0

scala> (-0d).signum
res2: Int = 0
```
Actually, in the current head release `scala.math.signum(-0d)` returns a negative zero (note, that a negative zero is equal to a positive zero if compared with `==`).

```scala
scala> math.signum(-0d)
res0: Double = -0.0

scala> res0 == 0
res1: Boolean = true
```
