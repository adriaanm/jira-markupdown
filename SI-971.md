In testing the new support in the development build for passing Java source files to Scalac, I found that this Java source file:
```scala
class A { static Object x = new java.util.HashMap<Object,Object>() ; }
```
causes scalac to emit this error:
```scala
A.java:1: error: `;' expected but `>' found.
```

my scalac is at subversion rev 15147

(btw I'm very excited about this new support...!)
