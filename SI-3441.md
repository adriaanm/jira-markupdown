When loading an arbitrary piece of XML with XML.load() and dumping it again to a string, attribute lists are reverse ordered in the output. This is fully valid (as XML attributes have no order, i.e., they can occur in an arbitrary order) but nasty. Seems like this happens because of the simple forward single-linked list (".next") of attribute nodes which is created when scanning attributes left to right and hence naturally results in this reverse order afterwards. I recommend to at least optionally fix the order in MarkupParser.xAttributes directly after parsing or at least dump XML with the original attribute orders during afterwards. 
Yes, this is very annoying, but this is a duplicate of SI-2735.  Please search the database before opening new tickets.
