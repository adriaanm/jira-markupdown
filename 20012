A Google for *scala nightlies api docs* lists this old document set,

   Scala Standard Library 2.11.0-20140303-150720 ...
   http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/library/#package

Removing this would help declutter search results. There are no obvious clues when browsing the docs that they are not the current nightlies.
