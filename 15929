I am getting an unexplainable compiler error from an alleged cyclic reference, when trying to mixin a trait to an existing one. The mixed in trait can be empty, name doesn't matter, as soon as i add it, the cyclic reference error comes up. this is with that subtrait being extended by a package object.

=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

supposedly this is the code:
```scala
sealed abstract class Rate {
   val id: Int
   val methodName: String
}
sealed trait scalar  extends Rate { final val id = 0; final val methodName = "ir" }
sealed trait control extends Rate { final val id = 1; final val methodName = "kr" }
sealed trait audio   extends Rate { final val id = 2; final val methodName = "ar" }
sealed trait demand  extends Rate { final val id = 3; final val methodName = "dr" }
case object scalar  extends scalar
case object control extends control
case object audio   extends audio
case object demand  extends demand

trait ScalarRated  { def rate = scalar }
trait ControlRated { def rate = control }
trait AudioRated   { def rate = audio }
trait DemandRated  { def rate = demand }

sealed trait HigherRate[ R <: Rate, S <: Rate ] {
   def rate1: R
   def rate2: S
}
sealed trait MaybeRateOrder
object NoRateOrder extends MaybeRateOrder
sealed trait RateOrder[ R <: Rate, S <: Rate, T <: Rate ] extends MaybeRateOrder {
   def in1: R
   def in2: S
   def out: T
}
trait Gugu
trait RateRelations extends Gugu
abstract sealed class LowPriorityImplicits {}
object synth extends LowPriorityImplicits with RateRelations {}
```

but it compiles fine alone. while inside the full project: https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider/tree/90f489be27696a445277442e794d1bd5e71cf5e4

the compiler aborts with
```scala
[info] Compiling main sources...
[error] /Users/hhrutz/Documents/devel/ScalaCollider/src/main/scala/de/sciss/synth/Rate.scala:91: illegal cyclic reference involving trait RateRelations
[error] trait RateRelations extends Gugu {
[error]                             ^
[error] one error found
```

this error is merely coming in when i try have any sort of trait as parent for RateRelations, so it clearly doesn't make sense and must be a bug. It is also triggered by package object synth inheriting from RateRelations. if i remove that mixin, it compiles again.

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

should compile. no cyclic reference involved here.

=== What do you see instead? ===

the above compiler error.

=== Additional information ===
(for instance, a link to a relevant mailing list discussion)

happens both in IDEA and sbt. compiler error appears very fast, only seconds after starting compilation, although project is huge.


=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala: 2.8.1.final
  - Java: build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065
  - Operating system: OS X 10.6.4
