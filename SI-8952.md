```scala
def int2let(i: Int, lower:Boolean):Char = 
  if(lower) ('a'+i).toChar 
  else ('A'+i).toChar
```
is truncated to 
```scala
def int2let(i: Int, lower:Boolean):Char = 
  if(lower) ('a'+i).toChar
```
and refuse to compile.
In standard mode, the REPL will infer a semicolon when you press enter, unless you are in a syntactic spot where a `(` or `{` is unbalanced.

We have to do this to be able to interpret `if (cond) action` is a complete expression by itself (the compiler infers a `else ()`) .

To disable this beheviour, you can enter paste mode.

```scala
scala> :paste
// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)

def foo =
  if (true) 1
  else 0

// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.

foo: Int
```
A previous trick of splicing the lines (the else is erroneous but is not erroneous when spliced to the previous fragment) was rejected because of side effects.  

The example suggests it could be revived for defs, where nothing was evaluated.
```scala
scala> def foo =
     |   if (true) 1
foo: AnyVal

scala> else 0
// Continuing with definition of `foo`

     | def foo =
     |   if (true) 1
     |   else 0
foo: Int

scala> 
```
The effect might be Byzantine, or miniature.
