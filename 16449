Since yesterday (Oct. 6), I'm getting test failures in my scala-refactoring project with Scala 2.10-SNAPSHOT. I tracked them down to a wrong position; the following code:

bq. List(1)

is represented as

bq. immutable.this.List.apply[Int](1)

but the `This` tree has exactly the same RangePosition as the `List` `Select`, which is clearly incorrect.
