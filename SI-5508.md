There was strange assertion fail while compiling a project. I know scala very basic and don't sure if used construction is valid in language reference, but compiler should generate more sensible error output in my opinion.

I've attached example file with several sections. Clear ones are ok, commented make compiler fail
simplified:

```scala
object Test {
  trait NestedTrait { // must be nested and a trait
    private[this] val _st : Int = 0 // must be private[this]
    val escape = { () => _st }
  }
}
```
