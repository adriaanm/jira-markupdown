```scala
trait C[T]
case class D[T](c: C[T])

object IntC extends C[Int]

object Test {
 (null: AnyRef) match { case D(IntC) => }
}
```

fails to compile with

```
Test.scala:10: error: pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
 found   : IntC.type
 required: C[Any]
Note: Int <: Any (and IntC.type <: C[Int]), but trait C is invariant in type T.
You may wish to define T as +T instead. (SLS 4.5)
  (null: AnyRef) match { case D(IntC) => }
                                ^
one error found
```

The error goes away using a hand-crafted `unapply` method:

```scala
object E {
  def unapply[T](x: D[T]): Option[C[T]] = None
}

// ...

(null: AnyRef) match { case E(IntC) => }
```
as Johannes says, this is due to adapt's (5.1) 

```scala
(5) Convert constructors in a pattern as follows: 
(5.1) If constructor refers to a case class factory, set tree's type to the unique 
      instance of its primary constructor that is a subtype of  the expected type. 
(5.2) If constructor refers to an extractor, convert to application of 
      unapply or unapplySeq method. 
```
a variation:
```scala
  scala> case class Transition[S](x: S) ;  object C ; (??? : Any)   match  { case Transition(C) => }
    <console>:11: error: pattern type is incompatible with expected type;
     found   : C.type
     required: S
            (??? : Any) match  { case Transition(C) => }
                                                 ^
```
Jason bisected it:

```scala
scala-hash is missing a build or two around the critical area, but is in:

Here's my take on it (the variation in Adriaan's comment which is a regression).

https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/ticket/5900?expand=1
The regression from 2.10 is addressed in https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/3514 by reverting part of #7886.
