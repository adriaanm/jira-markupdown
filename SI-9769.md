some discussion has been started over here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36982684/auto-mix-api-when-self-typing-in-scala]

This is somehow unexpected in scala(or my expectation is wrong). So following are some sample code:

{code:scala}
    trait A
    trait B

    trait HasA { def foo: A }
    trait HasB { def foo: B }
{code}

so far so good, then i do

{code:scala}
scala> trait HasBoth extends HasA with HasB
<console>:11: error: overriding method foo in trait HasA of type => A;
 method foo in trait HasB of type => B has incompatible type
       trait HasBoth extends HasA with HasB
{code}

Alright, I see the error. it makes sense.

but the confusion comes following:

{code:scala}
trait Wrapper[T] { def get: T }
trait HasBoth2 { self: Wrapper[HasA with HasB] => def bar = get.foo }
{code}

this isn't right. if we check the type of bar, its B. if we flip the order, such that the constraint is HasB with HasA, then bar is A.

so we have some inconsistency here.

Expectation:

    1. {{HasA with HasB}} yields \{ def foo: A with B \} automatically, or
    2. HasBoth2 yields a type incompatibility error.
