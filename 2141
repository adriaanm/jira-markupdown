Package handling has changed recently (late July). It's also been discussed extensively on scala-user.

Here's an email from Ricky Clarkson to scala-internals that summaries the changes (it may be a good idea to follow that list if you like using the bleeding edge -- note that the list is only for developers discussing their work on the compiler/core libraries):


  Before:

  package my.scala.stuff

  Here, scala.List(3,4,5) looks for my.scala.List(3,4,5), and gives a
  compile error.

  After:

  package my.scala.stuff

  Here, scala.List(3,4,5) gets _root_.scala.List, and works fine.

  Suppose I _want_ scala.List to be my.scala.List:

  package my
  package scala.stuff

  Here, scala.List(3,4,5) looks for my.scala.List(3,4,5).

  A large recent thread on imports in the scala-user thread gives some
  background.  I expect someone else is typing a better explanation up.



hope this helps
