Would it be feasible to be able to apply the curried, tail-recursive function �sum� like �sum(x => x)(1, 3)� assuming the declared default value of zero for function parameter �acc�?

The below example code is based on the PDF Scala by Example, chapter 5 First-class functions:

{code}
package sumOfFun
object sumOfFunExciting extends Application {
    def sum(func: Int => Int)(from: Int, to: Int)(acc: Int = 0): Int = if (from > to) acc else sum(func)(from + 1, to)(acc + func(from))
    val sumInts = sum(value => value)_
    val sumSquaresOfInt = sum(value => value * value)_
    def powerOfTwo(power: Int): Int = if (power == 0) 1 else 2 * powerOfTwo(power - 1)
    val sumPowersOfTwo = sum(powerOfTwo)_
    println("Sum of integers from 1 to 3 is " + sumInts(1, 3)(0) + ".")
    println("Sum of integer squares from 1 to 3 is " + sumSquaresOfInt(1, 3) + ".")
    println("Sum of powers of two from 1 to 3 is " + sumPowersOfTwo(1, 3) + ".")
}

{code}

The output on the console looks as follows:

{code}
Sum of integers from 1 to 3 is 6.
Sum of integer squares from 1 to 3 is <function1>.
Sum of powers of two from 1 to 3 is <function1>.
{code}
