In my example I had

{code}
type Element <: Node with IElement
type Document <: Node with IDocument
{code}

which seems to get interpreted as

{code}
type Element <: INode
type Document <: INode
{code}

i.e. the second parts of the bound ("IElement" and "IDocument") seem not to be considered.

I am not sure if this behaviour can be called correct.
