In my example I had
```scala
type Element <: Node with IElement
type Document <: Node with IDocument
```

which seems to get interpreted as
```scala
type Element <: INode
type Document <: INode
```

i.e. the second parts of the bound ("IElement" and "IDocument") seem not to be considered.

I am not sure if this behaviour can be called correct.
