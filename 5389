(In r24547) My early attempts to implement non-integral ranges in a way which
was useful without having lots of floating point traps were less
than successful.  One of the bigger backfires is that the requirement
not to round (trying, and failing anyway, to avoid surprises with
methods like "contains") inflicts runtime errors.

The simple way to improve this, which seems a good idea anyway,
is to make the default math context something less inclined to
exceptions.  Default BigDecimal mc is now DECIMAL128.
References SI-1812, SI-4201 and puts SI-4201 back to normal priority.
