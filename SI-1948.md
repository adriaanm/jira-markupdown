There seems to be another leak in actors. We use actors to pass large object, so any left references to messages takes tens megabytes of memory.

In Memory Analyzer report I see `scala.actors.Actor.received` as possible suspect. Not 100% sure yet, and still have no code to reproduce this bug, but looking at code:

1) Both at the end of receive and receiveWithin there is:

    val result = f(received.get)
    sessions = sessions.tail
    result

`received` here is processed but not cleares, so I suggest adding:

received = None

2) `received` is processed only in `receive` method. But `send` methods sets it in any case:

      received = Some(msg)
...
      if (isSuspended)
        resumeActor()
      else // assert continuation != null
        scheduler.execute(new Reaction(this, continuation, msg))

As far as I can understand, `received` should be set only if `isSuspended` (for `receive`). `react` processes it as `new Reaction` argument. So I suggest delete this line at the beginning of `send` method:

      received = Some(msg)

and modify:

      if (isSuspended) {
        received = Some(msg)
        resumeActor()
      } else // assert continuation != null
        scheduler.execute(new Reaction(this, continuation, msg))
Great! Thank you very muck for such a quick responce!
Just in case, code to reproduce this bug. Now it is fixed, I confirm it.

import scala.actors._
import scala.actors.Actor._

object Ticket1948 {
  def main (args: Array[String]) {
    val actors = (1 to 1000).toList map { x => actor { loop { react {
      case x: Array[Int] => reply ("OK"); exit }}}
    actors foreach { x => x !? new Array[Int] (1000) }
  }
}
