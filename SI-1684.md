I often run the interpreter under -Ydebug and have forever endured a mysterious exception and its 50+ line stack trace on startup.  I finally tracked it down to the interpreter generating incorrect code.  A patch fixing this is attached; it also updates a call from the deprecated isJavaLetterOrDigit to the not deprecated isJavaIdentifierPart.
We can't use the part involving `contains` yet as the version taking a string is not available in 1.4.  I'll look into applying the second part of the patch.
Indeed, I tested it out on the 1.4 JVM and build and didn't have any problems with -Ydebug.  On 1.5 it is clearly trying to use the `contains` method that was added in 1.5, rather than the implicit one made available from the implicit conversion.  This seems like some kind of bug in the implicit resolution logic, so maybe it would be worth filing a ticket related to that.  However, I expect without a more precise example Martin will not really have time to track it down.

I applied the patch in r17012.
Okay, I just lost twenty minutes by accidentally closing my tab in firefox.  A rather abbreviated version of same:

I discovered while trying to figure this out all the way that the JVM1.4 build has its own private RichString, which does contain contains(String), added by you last april.
```scala
  def contains(arg: String) : Boolean = {
    self.matches(""".*\Q"""+arg+"""\E.*""")
  }
```
On the chance it might be obvious to someone else, here is the diff between the 1.4 and 1.5 interpreter outputs, the first one being the one which works.
```scala
< [log typer] infer view from scala.this.Predef.String to ?{val contains: ?}
---
> [log typer] inferring view from scala.this.Char('\012') to lang.this.CharSequence
> [log typer] infer view from scala.this.Char('\012') to lang.this.CharSequence
```
Looking just at this, one might think that under 1.5 it tries to convert the argument from Char to something accepted by String (i.e. CharSequence) but then stops short of trying to convert the receiver to something which accepts Char (i.e. RichString.) That would sound like a great explanation except that my attempts to duplicate it do not fail that way, plus I assume such a thing would have been noticed long ago.  I think it is some variation on that, but with one or more additional complicating factors.

Indeed.  I had completely forgotten about the fact that I added that.  While I wouldn't have seen it on the standard API documentation, as it is generated against the 1.5 version of the library, it does seem like it would be a good for a future version of scaladoc to try to include a section of "implicit" members.

So you original patch probably would have been valid, though I think the implementation I gave for contains in RichString is subpar in that it won't properly handle arguments that include "\E".

Okay, I'll ask Martin if this is enough for him to go on.
