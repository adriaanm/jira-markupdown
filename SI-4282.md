=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===

Attempt to mixin a Java class with a protected (or assumedly private) constructor into a blank anonymous class. This results in an IllegalAccessException as the constructor seems to be called directly. Adding any content to the anonymous class fixes the issue. (But I wanted a blank one!)


```scala
Java:

public class JavaClass{
  protected JavaClass(String foo){
  }
}

Scala:

import JavaClass

object ScalaClass{
  
  val mixed = new {} with JavaClass("my string")
}

```

=== What is the expected behavior? ===

Scala should create a new anonymous class which extends JavaClass, so that that instantiation succeeds despite the fact that the Java constructor is protected

=== What do you see instead? ===

Compilation succeeds but a run-time IllegalAccessException is thrown because (assumedly) the "blank" anonymous class is optimized away and Scala tries to instantiate the JavaClass using it's protected constructor.

=== Additional information ===
A hack which fixes the problem is to add a trivial change in the anonymous class:

```scala
new {val fakeVal = 1} with JavaClass
```

This change eliminates the IllegalAccessException

=== What versions of the following are you using? ===
  - Scala:2.8.1
  - Java:1.6
  - Operating system: Mac OSX 10.6
Im sorry, that should say:
```scala
val mixed = new {} with JavaClass("my string")
```

where the super class constructor is being called with the parameter (maybe its more minimal without it but that's not what i was doing when i got the error)
I am unable to reproduce this:

```scala

```
```scala
$$ scala -version
Scala code runner version 2.8.1.final -- Copyright 2002-2010, LAMP/EPFL
$$ cat JavaClass.java 
public class JavaClass{
  protected JavaClass(String foo){
  }
}
$$ cat s.scala 
object ScalaClass{
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val mixed = new {} with JavaClass("")
  }
}
$$ javac JavaClass.java 
$$ scalac s.scala
$$ scala ScalaClass
$$ _
```
This report is not understandable in its current form.  Please reopen with the exact code demonstrating the problem, because this can't possibly be it.  Also you can't mix in a java class because it can't be a trait.  The syntax "new {} with JavaClass(...)" is for supplying early defs.
