I've added your test from SI-8801: https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4347

Always happy to kill N birds with M stones where N > M, but I agree it would be better to avoid duplicate birds from taking flight in the first place. I do close a *lot* of new tickets as duplicates, but don't find the old ones, and sometimes forget to look. Thankfully in this case the minimization and fix were both surprisingly forthcoming.

I'll take a look through that list, too.
