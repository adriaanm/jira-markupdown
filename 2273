Just to note, this has nothing whatsoever to do with Stream (at least if scala/bug#2835 is really a duplicate). At any rate, I reduced it to the following, in my case:
```scala
object CrashTest {
  object Rule {
    def unapplySeq(line: String) = line match {
      case "" => Some(Seq("x"))
      case "." => Some(Seq("y", ""))
      case _ => None
    }
  }
  
  def computeRules(lines: Iterator[String]) = {
    (lines foldLeft ("")) {
      case (acc, line) => line match {
        case Rule(rule: String) => acc // Removing ": String" prevents the crash
        case Rule(rule, terminal: String) => terminal
      }
    }
  }
}
```
