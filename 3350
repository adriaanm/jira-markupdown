I have tested the new version, and have a few comments;

1) If I just write "M" + <tab>  I get "Menu" and "Music" proposals on my computer which are plain folders under my home dir. I do not think folders should be expanded (unless maybe if they correspond to real packages with class files correctly rooted at the home dir).

2) If I write "Ma" + <tab> I would expect to get "java.lang.Math" as a proposal as Math is in the default lang package (it does work if I write "java.lang.Ma" + <tab>

3) If I write "Math.max" <tab> nothing happens initially but if I press <tab> again I get proposals correctly.

4) If I write "Mat.max(" <tab> I get nothing
