(In r23622) "I invite everyone to change this rule, and observe what breaks!"

This much beloved comment from scala/bug#1208 has been on my radar for two
years.  The worm has turned.  Closes scala/bug#1208.  The inferred type of an
object is now Foo.type instead of "object Foo".  What once was this:

  scala> val x: Map[Int, Singleton] = Map(1 -> None)
  <console>:5: error: type mismatch;
   found   : (Int, object None)
   required: (Int, Singleton)

Now exudes a pleasing aura of workingness:

  scala> val x: Map[Int, Singleton] = Map(1 -> None)
  x: Map[Int,Singleton] = Map(1 -> None)

No review.
