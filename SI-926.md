I was working on a scala project that depends on a Java project, so I was just switching between scala and java edit buffers, after a while, I'd get this error: 

{code}
!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui.workbench 4 2 2008-05-16 13:11:11.035
!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: "org.eclipse.ui.workbench".
!STACK 0
java.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.CompilationUnitEditor cannot be cast to ch.epfl.lamp.sdt.ui.scalaeditor.ScalaEditor

{code}

After that, the edit buffers just behave weird, and the problem props up whenever I switch from scala to java.  This error can be reproduced very easily.

Was using Eclipse 3.3, Sun JDK 1.6, Plugin 2.7.1.RC1

yeah, it happens just by switching between java and scala buffers and doing random edits.  The problem occurs regardless of whether the java and scala files are in the same project or not.  After that error, all the keys intended for the foreground java buffer gets sent to the previous scala buffer that was switched away from.

Things are fine though when I use two windows, one exclusively for java, the other exclusively for scala....

I just switched to the Nightly build today, and things are working fine so far.

thanks,
