I should also point out that "AbsXXX" is used as a name in six other places in the reflection library.  In 6/6 it means "an abstract class which is extended by something else." Here you are using "Abs" for the concrete class in regards to what it represents rather than in reference to what it is.  It is a naming category error to mix them.

It isn't as if "Abs" is unambiguous, either.  One can easily imagine an "absolute type tag" for instance, in contrast to a "relative" one which requires a prefix.  An absent type tag, an absurd type tag... we have the means to alias long names.  AbsTypeTag is still too long for me if I care about the length at all, so I'd have to alias it anyway.  Why not let me alias from a name which doesn't require still more decoding.
