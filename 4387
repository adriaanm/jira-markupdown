Adriaan, could you have a look? It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem, the implicit search wants to use the implicit value in $$anon, during it's construction, but the object is not yet constructed. It correctly uses Component.this.env for the super constructor call. If I explicitly add that one myself, the inner one is also corrected.
```scala
def dep: Dep = {
      final class $$anon extends Dep {
        def this(): anonymous class $$anon = {
          $$anon.super.this(Component.this.Inner.apply()($$anon.this.env))(Component.this.env);
          ()
        };
        <empty>
      };
      new $$anon()
    };
```
