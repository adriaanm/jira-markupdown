because the interpreter immediately uses the value in order to print it:

scala> lazy val x = 3
x: Int = 3
{code}

this might seem like a fairly trivial issue, but I think it has potential to confuse people who are trying stuff out in the REPL in order to understand the language.


I have implemented this, patch attached.
{code}
scala> lazy val x1 = { println("I'm a lazy x1") ; 5 }
lazy val x1: Int = <deferred>

scala> lazy val x2 = { println("I'm a lazy x2") ; 55.3 }
lazy val x2: Double = <deferred>

scala> x2 + x1
I'm a lazy x2
I'm a lazy x1
res0: Double = 60.3

scala> x2 + x1 + 5
res1: Double = 65.3
{code}

I thought I'd be able to just dash it off but it was harder than I thought -- though the final patch only adds a net of five lines to the interpreter, I'm sure I had 100-150 lines going at the peak.  At least I learned a lot about the repl along the way.  Please let me know if this is inadequate and I'll do whatever else is needed.
