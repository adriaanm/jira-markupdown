Yes, this is about the library's MarkupParser, see description. scala/bug#2735 was about the compiler's literal parser, so this is not a duplicate. But it's a similar issue.

The above is merely a workaround, but thanks anyway.

It should really be fixed so that round-tripping does not change things around needlessly.
