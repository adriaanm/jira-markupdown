By the way, from looking at the point of regression, it was apparent it would compile like this:
```scala
trait TFn1[I] { type In <: I }
trait >>[F1 <: TFn1[_], F2 <: TFn1[_]] extends TFn1[F1#In]
```
Here's another formulation which compiles which may be useful in the presumed non-toy example.
```scala
trait TFn1[I] { type In0 <: I ; type In = In0 }
trait >>[F1 <: TFn1[_], F2 <: TFn1[_]] extends TFn1[F1#In0]
```
