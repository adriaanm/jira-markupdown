Consider the code:
```scala
trait A extends DelayedInit {
  println("A ConstructionCode")

  def delayedInit(body: => Unit) = {
    body
    postConstructionCode
  }
  protected def postConstructionCode: Unit = {
    println("A PostConstructionCode")
  }
}
trait B extends A {
  println("B ConstructionCode")
  override protected def postConstructionCode: Unit = {
    super.postConstructionCode
    println("B PostConstructionCode")
  }
}

trait C extends B {
  println("C ConstructionCode")
  override protected def postConstructionCode: Unit = {
    super.postConstructionCode
    println("C PostConstructionCode")
  }
}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val c = new C {}
  }
}
```
This produces the output:
```scala
A ConstructionCode
B ConstructionCode
C ConstructionCode
```
But when the constructed "C" has a non-empty constructor, such as:
```scala
    val c = new C { println("New C ConstructionCode") }
```
Then the DelayedInit works and generates:
```scala
A ConstructionCode
B ConstructionCode
C ConstructionCode
New C ConstructionCode
A PostConstructionCode
B PostConstructionCode
C PostConstructionCode
```

Based on what you say you want, you would be better off with the alternative, which is also what I want, which I implemented and which was dismissed.

This is one of the bugs with DelayedInit. The first instantiation of C should have the same output as the second instantiation of C and similarly for the others.

I'm all for your alternative if we could get it introduced, but as it is DelayedInit exists now but requires bug-fixes...a new feature to the language I find doubtful at least in 2.10. I think it's reasonable for DelayedInit to be fixed before you can consider 2.10 to be out of RC considering this is a glaring bug that needs to be fixed.

"Is there any other way to accomplish post-constructor functionality in Scala today without DelayedInit?"

Nope. I have another unpublished branch which comes at it from another angle; you can define postInit in the companion of any class, and after instantiation it traverses all the base classes calling any companion-defined postInit methods with the newly created instance as the argument. This makes it possible to inherit from a class, write custom postInit code, yet still have the base class's postInit code called, without being required to know about and dispatch to the existing postInits.

The major weakness is that it of necessity depends on the participation of the compiler; it would all break down if any such class were instantiated from java. This might not matter to most people, but it would be an issue nonetheless. (You could make the constructors private, but then you lose the part where you can still use inheritance.)
We've not added any new stuff in Scala 2.11. We've focussed on making it easier to maintain Scala and contribute to it, by cleaning up our infrastructure, modularizing the library (and starting to modularize the compiler).  

Fixing DelayedInit would likely require deprecating it and replacing it by a new feature, possibly the one proposed in #4330.
As you know, this is quite a tricky problem that has been (re)-designed several times.

Scala is an open source project. We do our best to facilitate and support community contributions, but we can't do everything ourselves as our resources are limited.
If you'd like to see this issue resolved, I suggest you team up with other potential users, write up a proposal and submit a PR.
Don't blame the whole team. I abandoned scala because I feel exactly the same way. I have given that speech essentially verbatim ("fix it or remove it - it is ridiculously unprofessional to knowingly ship broken code", etc.) probably a dozen times over the last few years. Never made any difference: scala still ships all the same broken code. Much of it has been broken in the same way since I started working on scala, that being when 2.7.5 was the current release.

For instance: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-debate/M8s8FmASL8Y

Trust me when I say DelayedInit is way, way, way down the list of things which are known to be broken and which will not be fixed.
Quoting myself in that thread:
```
This is in that category of things where we suffer inordinately, for
years in some cases, over things which can trivially be fixed.
Sometimes it's worth doing something just for the something, not for a
large universe of abstract somethings, and especially when trying for
the large universe of abstract somethings leads to an inferior
solution for the specific actual something everyone wanted back in
Concretia.
```
Sigh.

"One post by one author." I'm glad to be reminded of this. There's so much which went into why I quit, I forget most of it at any given time. People really have no idea.
The idea behind DelayedInit is great. It has one advantage over suggested PostConstructor. It calls each superclass constructor body on the way to leaf subclass. For example we can design a safe object that doesn't break execution when constructor (one of in hierarchy) throws an exception. Instead it encapsulates a state that can be queried before using it. 

```scala
trait Worker {
	def use(): Unit
}

trait SafeWorker extends DelayedInit with Worker{
	private[this] var ok = true
	override final def delayedInit(body: ⇒ Unit): Unit = {
		if (ok) try body catch {case e: Throwable ⇒ ok = false}
	}
	def isOk: Boolean = ok
	def use(): Unit = if (isOk) println(s"Working...") else println(s"Oops...")
}

class MediaSafeWorker extends SafeWorker {
	throw new Exception
}

class MySafeWorker extends MediaSafeWorker { () }

class UnsafeWorker extends Worker{
	throw new Exception
	def use(): Unit = println(s"Working...")
}
```

Running this code prints: "Oops..."
```scala
	val safeObj = new MySafeWorker
	safeObj.use()
```

But running this code breaks execution with exception.
```scala
	val unsafeObj = new UnsafeWorker
	unsafeObj.use()
```

(i) SUGGESTED OPTION

DelayedInit trait needs some improvements.
-  It skips empty constructor body as mentioned in this thread. It would be great if it will pass to delayedInit method even empty body. 
-  @Erik Westra suggested [brilliant idea|https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4330?focusedCommentId=60542&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-60542] to detect class of currently executing constructor body. And it would be great to have delayedInit method version with extra argument for explicit current body class. 
```scala
def delayedInit (body: => Unit, bodyClass: Class[_])
```
. Or even version with argument for explicit mark indicating leaf class body.
```scala
def delayedInit (body: => Unit, bodyClass: Class[_], isLeafClass: Boolean)
```
  Or add def onCreate() when object construction is complete.

Current workaround is to use the solution suggested by @Erik Westra for detection of leaf class. And slightly raw solution to make asynchronous delayed cancellable invokation of onCreate method in base superclass and in the end of each body of delayedInit method.

```scala
trait Obj extends DelayedInit {
	postOnCreate()
	override final def delayedInit(body: ⇒ Unit): Unit = {
		cancelPostOnCreate()// pseudocode
		body
		if ((body _).getClass.getDeclaringClass == getClass) onCreate()
		else postOnCreate()
	}
	def postOnCreate(): Unit = post(id= "onCreate", delay=10 ms, onCreate())// pseudocode
	def onCreate(): Unit
}
```

If the body of leaf class is empty onCreate will be called 10 milliseconds after instance is constructed. Not cool but at least.

(!) NOTE for Android developers. 
Seems better add this line in Proguard config to avoid java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
```java
-keep class scala.DelayedInit
```
