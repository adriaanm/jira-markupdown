@cherro I totally agree that the default should be for annotations to only be added to fields by default. This would solve lots of problems with IoC/JPA etc.

Folks can always use the proposed nested annotations or as you say, write a custom mutator.

Having said that; I think there's a need to map in a DRY way, which of the generated elements (fields, accessors, mutators) the annotation goes on a per annotation basis more easily.

e.g. JAXB comes to mind; there are times you want them to be on fields or on properties.
