But You don't feel that it's strange?
Whatever what return type if it's Unit? I what to has some last statement like function call, why I should add something additional to have right compilation. 
It's like in Java you want:
{code}
int foo() {
  return 23;
}
void x() {
  foo();
}
{code}
Why it shouldn't compile with overloading resolution?
