=== What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)? ===
The following code:
```scala
object Flatten {

  def gen(depth: Int, span: Int): Iterator[Int] = {
    if (depth == 0) {
      (1 to span).iterator
    } else {
      ((1 to span) map { _ => gen(depth - 1, span) }).iterator.flatten
    }
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    printf("%d\n", gen(1, 1024).length)
  }

}

```

takes about 4 seconds to run on Scala 2.8.1.  On 2.9.0 it takes a little over 11 minutes.  Behavior is similar for small numbers instead of the '1024' for span.

A stack trace shows a large chain of calls through the Iterator made by `++.next` and `hasNext`.
(In r24962) Fix for Iterator flattening regression.  Not sure what happened,
but my theory is that ++ takes a by name argument, but doing a foldLeft
and using ++ to join creates a closure which loses the by-nameness.
If this theory is correct that's an ugly trap.

Not sure how I write a test against this sort of thing? Will take
pointers.  For now, closes #4582, no review.
In case there was any doubt, here is a test case which demonstrates that is indeed what happened.
```scala
object Test {  
  def it = {
    Thread.sleep(1000)
    (1 to 3).iterator
  }
  
  def timed[T](label: String)(body: => T): T = {
    val start   = System.currentTimeMillis
    val result  = body
    val end     = System.currentTimeMillis
    val elapsed = (end - start).toDouble / 1000

    println(label + ": " + elapsed + " seconds elapsed.")
    result
  } 
  
  def g1: Iterator[Int] = timed("create g1")(List(it, it, it, it, it).foldLeft(Iterator.empty: Iterator[Int])(_ ++ _))
  def g2: Iterator[Int] = timed("create g2")(Iterator.empty ++ it ++ it ++ it ++ it ++ it)
  
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val it1 = g1
    timed("run g1")(println(it1 mkString " "))
    
    val it2 = g2
    timed("run g2")(println(it2 mkString " "))
  }
}
```
This prints:
```scala
create g1: 5.012 seconds elapsed.
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
run g1: 0.0 seconds elapsed.
create g2: 0.0030 seconds elapsed.
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
run g2: 5.002 seconds elapsed.
```
(extempore in [r25315](https://codereview.scala-lang.org/fisheye/changelog/scala-svn?cs=25315)) Test case for ticket #4582.
