If I declare a method in a class in "scala-sequence" style:
```scala
    def foo(args: String*) : Unit
```
And inspect the generated class file (as if it had been generated from a Java class), the signature looks like:
```scala
    public void foo(scala.collection.Seq<java.lang.String> p0)
```
I think that, for interop with Java, it would be nice if we could generate a Java varargs method signature (that is, taking a String **array** with the **transient** modifier set):
```scala
    public transient void foo(java.lang.String[] p0)
```


I tried adding the *@transient* annotation but this was ignored by scalac!

I would ask for either:

1. The compiler automatically generates Java varargs-style "forwarder" methods for Scala sequence ones

2. A @varargs annotation is supplied, which, when used in conjunction with a scala-sequence method, generates a Java varargs forwarder as in scala/bug#1
