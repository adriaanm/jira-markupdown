I'm working on this bug here: http://github.com/retronym/scala-starrless/commits/t3555

I fixed the [http://github.com/retronym/scala-starrless/commit/4131457c499ecf4f1c7438acc7d288776fbac246 test framework for scalap], and thought I had [http://github.com/retronym/scala-starrless/commit/17dc393f909f6ff8f76cccb7cd65a4f93896bedb fixed this bug], too.

But I realised that my [http://github.com/retronym/scala-starrless/commit/547515930a14616fe50687eb808096ee80b6e9c4 test case was wrong.]
