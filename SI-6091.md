```scala
scala> class X { def ==(other: String) = true }
defined class X

scala> new X == null
<console>:9: warning: comparing a fresh object using `==' will always yield false
              new X == null
                    ^
res14: Boolean = true
```

The culprit:

```scala
case Select(qual, name @ (nme.EQ | nme.NE | nme.eq | nme.ne)) if args.length == 1 =>
```
A similar example reported in #6328:

```scala
scala> object Foo { def eq(x:Int) = x }
defined module Foo

scala> Foo.eq(1)
<console>:9: warning: comparing values of types object Foo and Int using `eq' will always yield false
              Foo.eq(1)
                    ^
res0: Int = 1
```
I am not entirely sure this is a bug.  Such an override guarantees that equality is asymmetric as `null==(new X)` cannot possibly be anything but false.

If you want weird non-equality-like behavior in your relation, I do not think it is too much to ask to not call it `==` and therefore retain this warning.
