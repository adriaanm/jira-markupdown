Not sure what you mean. The error gives no information on what the problem is. The fact that Paul, on the mailing list, was somewhat more specific than the error message, doesn't make the error message helpful. In 2.10.0-M6 I've gotten it in situations where it should have been a "no such identifier" as well as where it should have been "type mismatch" (as trivial tweaking revealed). The error shows that either (a) the problem is being detected at a point where scalac doesn't know more information, which is a problem --- it should either detect it at the point where it has the information, or it should have the information at the point it detects it; or (b) it has the information but it's not printing it.
