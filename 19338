Attempting to compile the following code will cause scalac to spin fruitlessly on multiple cores until the JVM runs out of memory
```scala
class Point{
  def iter =
    new Iterator[Point]{
      var currentPosition = this
      def next:Point = currentPosition
      def hasNext:Boolean = true
    }
}
```

This appears to be due to the {code:scala}var currentPosition = this{code} [when I introduced the bug into the code base I guess I was thinking 'this' would refer to the Point, it does not, of course. The compiler should complain at `def next...`]
