here's a transcript showing that a bad jar in an extensions directory is in fact one way to trigger this:

{noformat}
% mkdir -p ~/Library/Java/Extensions
% echo "ghkjfghjkfhkjgfg" > ~/Library/Java/Extensions/foo.jar
% scala
Welcome to Scala version 2.10.2 (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, Java 1.7.0_40).

scala> [init] error: error while loading <root>, error in opening zip file

Failed to initialize compiler: object scala.runtime in compiler mirror not found.
** Note that as of 2.8 scala does not assume use of the java classpath.
** For the old behavior pass -usejavacp to scala, or if using a Settings
** object programatically, settings.usejavacp.value = true.
{noformat}

with 2.11.0-M5, I get Jason's nicer error:

{noformat}
scala> [init] error: error while loading <root>, Error accessing /Users/tisue/Library/Java/Extensions/foo.jar
{noformat}
