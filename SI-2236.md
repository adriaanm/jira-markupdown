extempore here: I'm updating the summary and reassigning to scala_reviewer because I don't want this to get overlooked as "just" a manifest bug.  It actually can strike anytime you have an implicit val.
```scala
scala> class foo(implicit val x: Int)
defined class foo

scala> new foo()
<console>:6: error: could not find implicit value for parameter x: Int
       new foo()
       ^

scala> new foo() {}
java.lang.VerifyError: (class: $$anon$$1, method: <init> signature: ()V) Expecting to find object/array on stack
```

In 2.7 both the last two calls to new do the right thing.

 - original report follows -- 

I have produced this in both 2.7.3 and 2.8.0 at r18450. Happens only when the  singleton is extending a class with an implicit Manifest marked as a field in the constructor, and only when that Manifest is accessed. 

class Test[A](implicit val m: Manifest[A])
class Foo
object Bar extends Test[Foo]
Bar.m

java.lang.VerifyError: (class: Bar$$, method: <init> signature: ()V) Expecting to find object/array on stack

Meanwhile (new Test[Foo]).m works great. the work around is...

class Test[A](implicit m: Manifest[A]) { val foo = m}
object Bar extends Test[Foo]
Bar.foo

Sorry, am not used to trac.

Broken code:
```scala
class Test[A](implicit val m: Manifest[A]) 
class Foo 
object Bar extends Test[Foo] 
Bar.m 
```

Work around 1: 
`(new Test[Foo]).m`

Work around 2:
```scala
class Test[A](implicit m: Manifest[A]) {
    val foo = m
} 
object Bar extends Test[Foo] 
Bar.foo 
```
See also #2534.
THe following code will also yield a VerifyError in Scala 2.8 r19180 ... possibly that is why the ticket's name was changed to something more general?

```scala
class Test[A](implicit val m:Manifest[A])
class Foo
class Bar extends Test[Foo]
new Bar
```

(note Bar is a 'class' above, not an 'object' as in the prior test cases)
