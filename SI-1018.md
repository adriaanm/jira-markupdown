Hello, I was looking for the Eclipse plugin for Scala that is mentioned on the Scala-lang.org site, and the link was broken. Scala-lang.org suggested I contribute a bug report about the problematic link.

```scala
The following page was not found ("Error 404"):

    http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/scala-plugin-beta/ 

The referer page is http://www.scala-lang.org/tools/eclipse/index.html
```

Thanks.
