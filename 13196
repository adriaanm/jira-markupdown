Upon starting eclipse with the attached source files, when highlighting the file NaiveHeap.scala, I get a dialog saying "Presentation compiler error.  Reason: assertion failed".  The .metadata/.log file is also attached.  I think the error results from a typo I made on line 24 of NaiveHeap.scala, writing LeftistHeap instead of Heap.  Perhaps there is some odd typing circularity here...
