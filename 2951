> I'm with you on both points (as you can see above where I say it's more than cosmetic) but as to the second point, note that scala/bug#2083 was closed wontfix and with the indication that all bets are off for classes with a $$ in them, which of course is almost all of them.  I find I can no longer crash things in the same way, because classOf denies all knowledge of the trait implementation class - I wonder when that changed.

I don't know exactly when it changed, but I can point out the code that does that. It's the DefaultJavaContext in the ClassPath abstractions that filters out classes ending in "$$class".

That being said, I am open to any suggestions as to how to fix this.
