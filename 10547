Jason, really sorry, no idea how I missed your question.
Specialization concerns class type parameters while normalization concerns method type parameters:

{code}
class C[@spec T] { // class C is specialized via T
  def foo[@spec U](u: U) = ??? // method foo is specialized via T and normalized via U
}
{code}
