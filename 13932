Taking a closer look at transient lazy vals, I suspect it could be actually broken by design.

Given the following source:
```scala
@serializable
class testimpl {
  @transient lazy val classval: String = ""
}
```

This results into the following fields in the class:
```scala
  public volatile int bitmap$$0;
  private transient String classval;
```

That means, if an instance is serialized, the bitmap$$0 goes into the stream, the classval will be thrown away.

When deserialization takes place, classval will be null. But bitmap$$0 will have the init-flag for classval still set, i.e. classval wont be initialized again! ==> NPE!

I don't think that's the intended behavior.
