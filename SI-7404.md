Annotations are removed from `mods` in typer, and re-appear in corresponding symbols. However, this breaks the assumption that a (range) position can be mapped back to (a reasonable approximation of the) corresponding tree. This breaks everything in the IDE relative to annotations:

- hyperlinking: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1001648 
- type hover: https://www.assembla.com/spaces/scala-ide/tickets/1001669-hover-info-for-annotation-is-wrong

The "innermost enclosing tree" for an annotation position resolves to be the enclosing `Template`.
Not as far as I know. I talked to [~rytz] back then and he considered it a feature. But it would be great to find a solution and offer a better experience for IDE users.
