Proguard has been configured to explicitely keep all the scala classes I need, and works nicely, but I get this error at runtime when trying to use futures on Android :

    I/dalvikvm(19009): Could not find method sun.misc.Unsafe.throwException, referenced from method scala.b.a.a.a
    W/dalvikvm(19009): VFY: unable to resolve virtual method 9732: Lsun/misc/Unsafe;.throwException (Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V
    D/dalvikvm(19009): VFY: replacing opcode 0x6e at 0x0076
    W/dalvikvm(19009): Exception Ljava/lang/Error; thrown while initializing Lscala/b/a/a;

    E/AndroidRuntime(19009): java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError
    E/AndroidRuntime(19009): 	at scala.b.b.c.c(Unknown Source)
    ...

According to the very few results I got while searching, it's probably not Scala but the DalvikVM that's (at least on the surface) missing the sun.misc.Unsafe class.

Viktor provided a patch (attached) that could fix this, but I haven't had time to test it yet.
Uh, okay. Must have been something else. I was compiling the wrong version (2.11) of the Scala libraries.
Anyway, now I've got the 2.10-RC1-Patch compiled. I wanted to make sure, and decompiling the ForkJoinTask class present in the scala-library.jar yields the following, so your patch is indeed present :

```scala
> javap -c ForkJoinTask | grep throw                                                                                                         2.10.0-RC1-Patch [adaa5d2] untracked

   100:	athrow
```

It seems fine...
...and I get the exact same error running it on Dalvik. Bummer. Seems that sun.misc.Unsafe doesn't have throwException.

I'm not a huge Java hacker, so I do not know the specifics, but what's the reason behind the use of `sun.misc.Unsafe.throwException` instead of the normal `throw` keyword?
Fran√ßois-Xavier, please report back ASAP on how it fares without the Unsafely-class, we need to cut the next RC *very* soon and I'd love to be able to ship that with Android working.
The error messages are 
```

```
This is caused by Dalvik in Android 4 not having sun.misc.Unsafe.throwExeption.
The main problem is not that the message appears in the log (the class still loads), but that the call to Unsafe.throwException will not happen if the corresponding code is executed.
I'll try the attached patch, soon.
@Viktor: After some trial and error, exceptions are reported, *except* in the rare case where an exception occurs in the onFailure method. I was just happy it worked, and I didn't consider this case since it never happened to me. Okay, I agree this is definitely *not* a good thing for the release, so I'll try the patch later tonight, will keep you posted.
