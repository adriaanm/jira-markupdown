Thought: this is the motivation we've been waiting for to break down case classes into something more a la carte, and we could work in some accessor control at the same time.  Not to mention: we could make it so there wasn't such a huge either/or going between case classes and extractors in terms of match efficiency, exhaustiveness checking, and so on.  I'm guessing nobody is too keen to give up any :: performance.
