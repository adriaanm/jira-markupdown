I see no reason this should be allowed to happen, and a lot of reasons it shouldn't.
```scala
package foo
package _root_

object Test {
  import _root_.scala.Option
}
```
```
./a.scala:5: error: object scala is not a member of package foo._root_
  import _root_.scala.Option
                ^
one error found
```
So to be clear, that source should not compile, but it should not compile because *root* should be a reserved word.  The whole point of *root* is to know what you are importing.  Tying this into another ticket I opened recently:
```scala
// a.scala
package foo

import _root_.scala.Option

% scalac3 ./a.scala 
% mkdir -p foo/_root_
% scalac3 ./a.scala 
./a.scala:3: error: object scala is not a member of package foo._root_
import _root_.scala.Option
              ^
one error found
```
