What steps will reproduce the problem (please be specific and use wikiformatting)?
  1. Open [http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/collections-api/collections_7.html Sets].
  2. Find description for xs.empty in the first table.

What is the expected behavior?

 * "xs.empty" is formatted.

```scala
<tt>xs.empty</tt>
```

What do you see instead?
```scala
xs.empty
```
Similarly as #4056.
Fixed.
