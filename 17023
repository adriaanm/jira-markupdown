It doesn't make sense for the step value of the to() method to be a Char.  In particular there is no way to go backwards, because there is no such thing as a negative Char.
```scala
scala> '2' to ('9', 2.asInstanceOf[Char])
res13: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange.Inclusive[Char] = NumericRange(2, 4, 6, 8)

scala> '9' to ('1', -1.asInstanceOf[Char])
res14: scala.collection.immutable.NumericRange.Inclusive[Char] = NumericRange()
```
