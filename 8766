I won't try to answer, but presumably a complete definition of "defined locally to a constructor" would answer all those questions and many more. While we're at it, maybe we could motivate all this complexity a little better. Here's a thought:
```scala
implementation restriction: you can't declare classes in the midst of a supercall
scalac editorializes: come on, don't tell me this is so important you want us
picking through debris for INCONSTRUCTOR flag clues.
```
