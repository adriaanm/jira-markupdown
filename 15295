Given the current state of API documentation, it simply takes too much effort to find the right solution for common application use cases.

While some packages and classes (see elidable or BitSet) do have a sufficient description most lack any (see scala.runtime.AbstractFunction, scala.xml.parsing or transform). So in my opinion, the API documentation needs a major overhaul before scala promoters like me could recommend java folks implementing (parts of) their applications with scala.

This overhole should include use-case-oriented package, class and method descriptions garnished with examples - alternatively via links - and be, please, sceduled near-time.
