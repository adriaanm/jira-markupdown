All warnings beyond the first to the same position are silently dropped.  Since they may be about unrelated matters, this is less than ideal.  Martin says:
```
What we could do:

1) there may only be one error reported in any position
2) If an error is reported in a position no warning can be reported in
the same position
3) if there is no error reported in some position, any number of
warnings may be reported in that position.
```
This would certainly solve the problem for me - my concern is with the set of warnings issued on successful compilation runs (which are likely to be inferred by the user to be the complete set of normal warnings.)
Oh geez, I found this comment written 2 years, 5 months ago, by me of course.
```scala
/** Note: if a symbol has both @deprecated and @migration annotations and both
 *  warnings are enabled, only the first one checked here will be emitted.
 *  I assume that's a consequence of some code trying to avoid noise by suppressing
 *  warnings after the first, but I think it'd be better if we didn't have to
 *  arbitrarily choose one as more important than the other.
