My brief attempt failed to replicate the problem. Can you give a more detailed recipe? I made a file named "println.scala" with the following contents:
{code}
#!/usr/bin/env scala
!#
println("Hello, scalable world!")
{code}
I then ran it like this, and it worked:
{code}
$$ ./println.scala 
Hello, scalable world!
{code}
The following works, too:
{code}
$$ scala println.scala 
Hello, scalable world!
{code}
If that's what the original reporter was doing, then perhaps there is some difference on our machines that matters. Or, perhaps it has been fixed since the time it was reported?
