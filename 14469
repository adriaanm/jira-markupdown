```scala
def crash[A](lefts: Stream[A], rights: Stream[A]) = (lefts, rights) match {
    case (Stream.Empty, Stream.Empty) => None
    case (l #:: ls, rs) => None
  }
```


See attachments for test case, the error output, and equivalent 2.7.5 code that compiles.

I haven't found a workaround yet, any suggestions?

Tested against 2.8.0.r18583-b20090827020153.
