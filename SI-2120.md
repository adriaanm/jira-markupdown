Using Scala 2.7.5.final, on my machine I find that:

 * System.getProperty("file.encoding")  is "Cp1252"
 * scala.util.Properties.encodingString is "UTF8" 

This is a problem because it means that files written with, for example, java.io.PrintWriter with the (Java) default encoding, will throw an exception if read in by scala.io.Source using the (Scala) default encoding.

For example, the following is the error I got due to this mismatch:

{code}
Exception in thread "main" java.nio.BufferUnderflowException
	at java.nio.Buffer.nextGetIndex(Unknown Source)
	at java.nio.HeapCharBuffer.get(Unknown Source)
	at scala.io.BufferedSource$$$$anon$$2.next(BufferedSource.scala:86)
	at scala.io.BufferedSource$$$$anon$$2.next(BufferedSource.scala:74)
	at scala.io.Source$$$$anon$$6.next(Source.scala:307)
	at scala.io.Source$$$$anon$$6.next(Source.scala:301)
	at scala.Iterator$$$$anon$$14.next(Iterator.scala:267)
	at scala.Iterator$$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:414)
	at scala.Iterator$$$$anon$$14.foreach(Iterator.scala:265)
        ...
{code}
Note that the error message doesn't give any clue that this is an encoding problem. I'm not sure why that's true...

Anyway, my current workaround is to look up and specify the Java default encoding whenever I use Scala io, e.g.:
{code}
val encoding = System.getProperty("file.encoding");
val lines = Source.fromFile(path, encoding).getLines;
{code}

> If Scala is going to override the default encoding for the platform on which it is running, which is a pretty reasonable thing to do considering the defaults on Windows and OSX, then it should do so by setting the "file.encoding" property instead of defining it in code.

Believe it or not, changing the default via -Dfile.encoding is an unsupported implementation detail.  See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=cfd1bfd57a7b67fc37bb1713a446?bug_id=4163515 among others.

Also, this is a duplicate of SI-1581.  I'm aware of the encoding situation but it's way more complicated than anyone realizes, and definitely no solution is going to make everyone happy.
I just want to make clear that I wasn't specifying "-Dfile.encoding" or anything like that. Java has determined on its own that "Cp1252" is the default encoding on my platform. And Scala has determined on its own that "UTF8" is the default encoding. So the issue has nothing to do with me specifying any properties. Rather, it has to do with the mismatch between what Java and Scala assume for the default encoding.
