There's a comment which led me to this discovery; I don't know what was being imagined when this was written, but an intersection of one checkable type and one uncheckable type does not add up to a checkable type. It adds up to an uncheckable type.
{code}
// if at least one of the types in an intersection is checkable, use the checkable ones
// this avoids problems as in run/matchonseq.scala, where the expected type is `Coll with scala.collection.SeqLike`
// Coll is an abstract type, but SeqLike of course is not
{code}
