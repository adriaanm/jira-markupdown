That's some good detective work.  I can add the observation that removing the second case in its entirety has zero observable impact anywhere in the distribution or test suite, except that a.b.a.c starts working.  Assigning to martin for an opinion on what it is trying to accomplish.  Any code which can be removed without observable impact must be presumed buggy: either it isn't doing what is intended, or the bug is the absence of a test case which backstops its purpose by breaking in its absence.
