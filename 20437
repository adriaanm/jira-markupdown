I have seen a number of implicit resolution issues that have to do with declaration order. But they all seem to occur in fairly esoteric examples. I have what I think is a very normal example:
```scala
class B extends A { implicitly[Int] }
class A { implicit val i = 3 }

error: could not find implicit value for parameter e: Int
       class B extends A { implicitly[Int] }
```

It works in the reverse order:
```scala
class A { implicit val i = 3 }
class B extends A { implicitly[Int] }
```

A funny thing is, if you try to work around it by bringing the implicit into scope manually, you get an error because you have two implicits:
```scala
class B extends A { val x = { implicit val j = i; implicitly[Int] } }
class A { implicit val i = 3 }

error: ambiguous implicit values:
 both value i in class A of type => Int
 and value j of type Int
 match expected type Int
       class B extends A { val x = { implicit val j = i; implicitly[Int] } }
                                                                   ^
```

But if you delete the `implicit val j = i` line then it cannot find the implicit.
