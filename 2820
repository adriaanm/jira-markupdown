it seems the problem here is in `doTypedApply`, where we first filter out alternatives with the wrong number of parameters using:
```scala
var sym = fun.symbol filter { alt =>
  isApplicableSafe(context.undetparams, followApply(pre.memberType(alt)), argtypes, pt)
```

which causes the alternative 
```scala
[T](xs: T*)(implicit evidence$$2: scala.reflect.ClassManifest[T])Array[T]
```

to be filtered out because `Array[Nothing]` is not a subtype of `Unit` (`pt`).

Since it's only an optimisation anyway, I propose to be less strict and replace `pt` by `WildcardType`.
