What makes this extra fun, is that the workaround of replacing `private\[this\]` with `private` may not do any good. This is because sbt won't necessarily recompile classes implementing the trait because it doesn't think the public interface of the trait has changed.

*So be sure and do a clean compile if you apply this workaround.*
