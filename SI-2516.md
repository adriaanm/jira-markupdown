The compiler crashes when I try to match a somehow long object of type `List[(List[Char], List[Int])]` . 

I have attached a test case and the output of the compiler. To reproduce, simply run `scalac Test.scala`.
This bug has the same root cause as #1133, but breaking differently.  The pattern matcher algorithm constructs a DFA, which is fine most of the time but generates very deeply nested if/else code under conditions like nested Lists.  The typer then tries to type the if expression recursively, which is usually fine because normal people don't nest their if/elses 100 layers deep.

You can add more stack for now with -Xms.  I know how to fix it but I have quite a few more fundamental correctness issues in front of me first.
Closing as a duplicate of #1133, added a pointer to that ticket.
