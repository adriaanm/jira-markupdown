This comment in TreeInfo rings true:

{code}
  // TODO these overrides, and the slow trickle of bugs that they solve (e.g. SI-8479),
  //      suggest that we should pursue an alternative design in which the DocDef nodes
  //      are eliminated from the tree before typer, and instead are modelled as tree
  //      attachments.
{code}

I take it this bug showed up in the IDE after mixing Interactive with ScalaDoc.
