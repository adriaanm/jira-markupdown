The trait `scala.math.PartiallyOrdered` is -- surprisingly -- fundamentally different from `scala.math.Ordered`: its type parameter `A` is covariant (which was changed for the `Ordered` trait in 2.8), and its comparison methods (`tryCompareTo` etc.) take as argument a value of type `B >: A <% PartiallyOrdered\[B]`. The drawbacks are numerous:

- From a mathematical standpoint, it is surprising that trait `Ordered\[A]` does not (and presently cannot) extend trait `PartiallyOrdered\[A]`, even though the former is a specialization of the latter.
- This is aggravated by the fact that this inconsistency does not exist in the `...Ordering` traits: here, `Ordering\[T]` is in fact a subtype of `PartialOrdering\[T]`.
- From an implementers standpoint, the API difference between `PartiallyOrdered` and `Ordered` is highly confusing. 
- The signature of `tryCompareTo` makes it tedious to implement this method, even in simple settings such as for case classes.

A [Google search](https://www.google.de/search?q=scala+PartiallyOrdered&nfpr=1) suggests it is questionable if this trait is being used in any larger-scale context (maybe because of the above reasons; I am filing this issue also because I found it to be unusable in a context where I heavily make use of partial orders, which was kind of disappointing). In fact, most of the evidence of people actually using it is people [being](http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/How-to-implement-PartiallyOrdered-trait-td2300147.html) [confused](http://osdir.com/ml/lang.scala/2008-08/msg00125.html) about how to use it properly. The `VectorClock` class in Akka used to extend it, but not anymore.

As undesirable as API breakage is, I think this should be addressed rather sooner than later. Set aside any practical aspects, the current inconsistency between `Ordered`/`PartiallyOrdered` and `Ordering`/`PartialOrdering` alone is too confusing to leave this as is.
I saw that according [to the roadmap](http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12-roadmap), ****full**** source compatibility to 2.11 is intended. This leaves no other option than keeping the current version, even though the incompatibility can be assumed to be only theoretical. However, `PartiallyOrdered` should at least be deprecated.
