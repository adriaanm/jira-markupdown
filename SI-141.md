Current TestConsoleMain prints something like:

```scala
some test failed due to failed assertion: (no message), expected: 3, actual: 11
```

It is hard to find where test failed if test has many assertions declared in different methods. Need stack trace.
Fixed in rev 12973

Stack trace now appears in output; override method `enableStackTrace` to disable it.
```scala
class Test1 extends TestCase("Test1") {
  //override def enableStackTrace = false
  def runTest() {
    assertEquals("1: ", 3, 1)
  }
}
```
