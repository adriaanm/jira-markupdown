Lukas -- if you compile SchedulerProvider.scala you will see an inconsistent pickler entry at 36:
{code}
34,219: TERMname 21: QUARTZ_FACTORY_KEY_ID
35,242: POLYtpe 1: 36
36,245: CONSTANTtpe 1: 37 33
BAD ENTRY END: computed = 248, actual = 249, bytes = 15, 1, 37, 33
{code}
It says only one byte to follow but finds two.  I am confused because the pickler format documentation says there should be two, a typeRef and a constantRef:
{code}
 *                  | 15 CONSTANTtpe len_Nat type_Ref constant_Ref
{code}
However in reality there is only one, and from looking at how constant types are done, it seems like there should be only one.
{code}
// Pickler
        case ConstantType(value) =>
          writeRef(value); CONSTANTtpe
// Unpickler
        case CONSTANTtpe =>
          mkConstantType(readConstantRef())
{code}
...and as that's all the time I have, this concludes today's visit to Picklerdom.  Join us next week and every week here at Trac Mystery Theatre.
