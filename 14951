Consider the following program in Eclipse
{code}
class Vector {
  def - (other: Vector): Vector = this
}

object Test {
  val x = new Vector
  val y = x - x
}
{code}
Typing a period after the second occurrence of `x' gives me a list of members, but typing the same after the first occurrence does not.
I noticed that it first does a typedTreeAt for the position <x.> which gives an error, the it corrects itself and demands a typeMembers for x. The typeMembers method in Global does give back a list of members, but somehow this list is not shown afterwards.

Btw it's maybe best to wait for my next checkin (on Jan 24th of interaactive.Global because I added something else which makes code completion more robust.
