When compiling Akka I with 2.11.0-M8 I get a compilation error without line numbers or file information in one of the tests.

{code}
[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Any
[error]  required: AnyRef
[error] Note: Any is not implicitly converted to AnyRef.  You can safely
[error] pattern match `x: AnyRef` or cast `x.asInstanceOf[AnyRef]` to do so.
[error] one error found
[error] (test:compile) Compilation failed
[error] Total time: 68 s, completed Jan 31, 2014 4:45:55 PM
{code}

I've also tried with this SNAPSHOT version (2.11.0-20140131.015148-534) and it fails in the same way.

It might be that it's not one of the test frameworks that are using macros in a bad way, but I've "minimized" the problem to a standalone project.

Actually it looks like an old, latent bug. It must be trigged by the current layout of the implicits in scope.

I can reproduce it with 2.10.3 (using the exact classpath as in your report):

Analysis: 

I believe that we should create a throwaway Context in:

{code}
    // Typers.scala
    def viewExists(from: Type, to: Type): Boolean = (
         !from.isError
      && !to.isError
      && context.implicitsEnabled
      && (inferView(EmptyTree, from, to, reportAmbiguous = false) != EmptyTree)
    )
{code}

This is called in your example when performing overload resolution between the two `==` members on `ByteString`. One in inherited from `Any`, the other from `AnyRef`.

Scala has a pretty gnarly approach to overload resolution, in which it checks if arguments of the types of candidate A could are applicable to to candidate B, and vice-versa. This should determine that the method in `AnyRef` is more specific. (Note: they are really two independent members, as the parameter types don't exactly coincide).

Anyway, during this applicability checking, implicit views are allowed. This triggers a search for an implicit view from `Any => AnyRef`, which results in an ambiguous error with that warning. Coopting the ambiguity error for this purpose is already suspicious; I remember being a bit concerned when that was added, actually. Anyway, this error gets buffered in the enclosing Context (because we didn't make a child context to firewall the results of this implicit search), and later helpfully issued at the position of the `EmptyTree` passed as a dummy by `viewExists`.
Isolated:

{code}
trait Equalizer[T]
trait Gen[A]

class Broken {
  implicit def const[T](x: T): Gen[T] = ???
  implicit def convertToEqualizer[T](left: T): Equalizer[T] = ???

  def in(a: Any) = ()
  in {
    import scala.Left
    "" == ""
  }
}
{code}

Paul pointed out in another ticket that the fact the `AnyRef#==` overloads, rather the overrides `Any#==` is pretty suspicious. You would not be allowed to compile real classes with those signatures as they collapse into an overriding relationship after erasure.

Looks like the fix is less risky than I thought. One of my attempts uncovered SI-8230.
Marking SI-8463 as a duplicate of this ticket. We should add its test cases when fixing this bug:


*Reproduce code:*
{code}
  case class Foo[+T[_]](activity:T[Long])
  type Cell[T] = T
  def insertCell(u:Foo[Cell]) = ???
  insertCell(Foo(5))
{code}

*Expected result:*
Type error with line numer.

*Actual result:*
{noformat}
[error] type mismatch;
[error]  found   : Long
[error]  required: ?T
[error] Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
[error]  both method longWrapper in class LowPriorityImplicits of type (x: Long)scala.runtime.RichLong
[error]  and method any2Ensuring in object Predef of type [A](x: A)Ensuring[A]
[error]  are possible conversion functions from Long to ?T
{noformat}

It seems to be related to using a type alias and a long. Those all produce type errors with line numbers:

{code}
  case class Foo2[+T[_]](color:T[String])
  def insertCell2(u:Foo2[Cell]) = ???
  insertCell2(Foo2("color"))

  def insertOption(u:Foo[Option]) = ???
  insertOption(Foo(5))

  def insertOption2(u:Foo2[Option]) = ???
  insertOption2(Foo2("color"))
{code}

Another code sample that produces the same error message without line number:
{code}
  class DefaultType[Name]
  case class Foo[+T[_]](
    activity:T[Long]
  )(t:DefaultType[T[_]])
  Foo(3)(new DefaultType[Option[_]])
{code}
