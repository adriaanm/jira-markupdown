I'm fairly confident that this is a variant of scala/bug#1002 ... ie. it's a bug tripped by your project being located outside of your workspace.

This is fixed on trunk and it'd be extremely helpful if you could verify that that solves your problem. If you need to stick with 2.7.3.final then a simple workaround should be to move the project into your workspace.
