In 2.9.0, on SetLike:

{code}
  def ++ (elems: GenTraversableOnce[A]): This = newBuilder ++= seq ++= elems.seq result
{code}

So if I have code which does:
{code}
  aVeryVeryLargeSet ++ Nil
{code}

Adding multiple elements has just become an O(N) operation (or O(n)) because we always add all of the current Set, irrespective of how many new members we have. 

I believe that in  2.8.x this method was coming from TraversableLike and was using an implicit CanBuildFrom which was being given the current repr as a seed.
