Following code looks perfectly fine, but scalac 2.11.8 generates an error message.

Code:
```Scala
case class A(v: Int)
class B(v: Int) extends A(v)

object Test {
  val a = new B(1)
  a match { case A(_) => 1 }
}
```

Error:
```Scala
error: constructor cannot be instantiated to expected type;
 found   : A
 required: B
  a match { case A(_) => 1 }
                 ^
one error found
```

However, if we annotate `a` with `val a:A = new B(1)`, everything is fine.
