Scala Reference, 4.2

A variable definition var x: T = _ can appear only as a member of a template. It introduces a mutable field with type T and a default initial value. The default value depends on the type T as follows:
0 if T is Int or one of its subrange types, 0L if T is Long,
0.0f if T is Float,
0.0d if T is Double,
false if T is Boolean,
() if T is Unit,
null for all other types T .
