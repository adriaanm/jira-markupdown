To add to the knowledge base here:

I also experienced this lack of autocomplete on OS X 10.11.4, using Scala 2.11.7. I did not have EMACS set in my environment, but did have EDITOR exported to the value "vim". After exiting the scala REPL; running *{{unset EDITOR}}*; and then starting scala again, autocomplete on the repl appears to work perfectly.

I did not investigate whether setting to other values of $EDITOR made a difference, but it's interesting that my scala's autocompletion was hindered by an env variable that had nothing to do with emacs, either by name or value.
