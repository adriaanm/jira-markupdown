FYI: -Yvirtpatmat fixes this issue.

I cloned the repo and checked with 2.10.0-M1:
{code}

git diff
diff --git a/build.sbt b/build.sbt

NOTE: I changed dependencies so those compiled against 2.9.1 were used even if we compile with 2.10.0-M1. This doesn't matter that much because we are interested in compiler crash and not binary compatibility issues.

I was able to reproduce the problem with such setup. However, after adding "-Yvirtpatmat" to scalacOptions it compiled successfully and very quickly.
