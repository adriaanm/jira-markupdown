given our common java backgrounds, we are used to not using qualified types in links. So we often do

```scala
/** blah blah [[MyClass]] */
```

sometimes we forget we have to fully qualify classes; sometimes we make a typo. But scaladoc silently ignores badly named link types.

We should generate a warning instead - so we can catch typos and improve the linking in our documentation
(In r24640) Warn about unqualified names in scaladoc links because they don't work.
I think it would be better to just make them work, but the way things
are structured it looks involved.  Closes #3696, no review.
