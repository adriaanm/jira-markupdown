REPL receives mention on the getting started page, but doesn't have a doc page of its own on the new scala-lang.org.

People have questions, REPL has answers.

Even a page with just the basics would be really valuable, IMO.

Over time it would be nice if it eventually reached completeness, but it doesn't need to start there. A first version could end with a bullet list of things which exist but are not doc'ed (that, it seems like we could fairly easy get complete or nearly complete) and an invitation for further pull requests.

TIL {{lastException}}:

{noformat}

scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing
  at scala.Predef$.$qmark$qmark$qmark(Predef.scala:225)
  ... 33 elided

scala> lastException
res1: Throwable = scala.NotImplementedError: an implementation is missing
{noformat}

I also got started, just to have a place to list features of interest.

https://github.com/scala/scala.github.com/pull/476

I'm not able to build the pages yet, heads up.

Notes to self/other potential contributors:

* I've always wanted something to tell me more of what the mystical {{:power}} mode is about, when I might want to use it. I guess I'm not a power user!
* [These 2.11 release notes|http://docs.scala-lang.org/scala/2.11/] would be a good source for fleshing out the overview more. A wealth of useful stuff there with a good start on docs for it already.
* The REPL has no config file but you can manually {{scala -i}} or use an alias or wrapper script to have your own library of utility functions, common imports, etc. The file can include REPL commands like {{:load}} and {{:paste}}.
* I'd like to know where to find properties that might be useful, e.g. {{scala -Dscala.color}}.
