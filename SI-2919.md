Using Scala 2.8.0.Beta1-RC7, trying to compile the attached Link.scala and StringOptionAdapter.scala will succeed if scalac is executed with

{code}
$$ scalac StringOptionAdapter.scala Link.scala
{code}

but compilation will fail as below if I change the order

{code}
$$ scalac Link.scala StringOptionAdapter.scala
Link.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : java.lang.Class[StringOptionAdapter]
 required: java.lang.Class[_ <: javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter]
 @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(classOf[StringOptionAdapter]) val title:
Option[String] = None
                           ^
{code}
r17925 and SI-1782 may be of interest.
Regression introduced in r19570 which was to fix SI-2454.

Trouble was anticipated.  Quoth Adriaan: "this works for now (will check fix in today), but we can't guarantee this will keep working due to the hairy interaction between the necessity of cooking raw java types to existentially quantified scala types (this only happens for types of symbols that are accessed or overridden) and simply treating these types as higher-kinded types"
ugh... minimal test case:

{code}
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlJavaTypeAdapter
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter

// abstract class StringOptionAdapter extends XmlAdapter[String, Option[String]] // this causes XmlAdapter to be cooked, 
// so that the bound `XmlAdapter` in `XmlJavaTypeAdapter`'s field  `value` with type:
//  `Class<? extends XmlAdapter>` becomes `XmlAdapter[_, _]`

// does not type check unless above definition is uncommented
case class Link(@XmlJavaTypeAdapter(classOf[XmlAdapter[String, Option[String]]]) val title: Option[String])
{code}


I almost daren't suggest it, but here's a patch that "fixes" this bug (and probably introduces another one... like relaxing kind-checking when java and scala type constructors are mixed :-s)

in   `def isHKSubType0(tp1: Type, tp2: Type, depth: Int): Boolean = ...`
{code}
-      case (_, _) => false // @assume !tp1.isHigherKinded || !tp2.isHigherKinded 
-      // --> thus, cannot be subtypes (Any/Nothing has already been checked)
+      case (_, _) => 
+        // @assume !tp1.isHigherKinded || !tp2.isHigherKinded 
+        // --> thus, cannot be subtypes (Any/Nothing has already been checked)
+        // last chance: try cooking java types... YUCK
+        @inline def HK2Raw(tp: Type): Type = if(tp.isHigherKinded) rawToExistential(tp) else tp
+        val tp1r = HK2Raw(tp1) 
+        val tp2r = HK2Raw(tp2)
+        !(tp1r.isHigherKinded || tp2r.isHigherKinded) && (tp1r <:< tp2r)
{code}

Martin: what do you think?
(In r22037) Test closes SI-2919 which now works.  Review by moors (to bring to your
attention in case the ticket was being left open intentionally.)
thanks for reminding me, Paul -- I think this was fixed by r21963 as SI-3429 was a duplicate of this one
