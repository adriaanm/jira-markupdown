You're right about ++:, it doesn't exist in Seq.

But +: does, and it works, even if the Seq is a ListBuffer.  It looks like +: and :+ were added in order to resolve the ambiguities and pitfalls surrounding using the + method with Seq.

All I am asking is to replace the definition of +: in BufferLike with the following:

{code}
@migration(2, 8,
    "As of 2.8, +: always creates a new collection, even on Buffers.\n"+
    "Use += instead if you intend to add by side effect to an existing collection.\n"
)
final def +:(elem: A): This = elem +=: clone()
{code}
