If you specify a "actors.maxPoolSize" property which is lower than the FJTaskScheduler2's calculated corePoolSize, a ThreadPoolExecutor is created with the maxPoolSize < corePoolSize which results in an undescriptive IllegalArgumentException. 

This behaviour has changed between 2.7.5-final and 2.7.7-final and hence represents a patch-version release which is backwards-incompatible. 

The ThreadPoolExecutor should be created with a coreSize of min(maxPoolSize, corePoolSize)
