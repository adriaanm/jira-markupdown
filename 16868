The interpretation of StringContext.s is strange when applied to the string literal `s"a\nb"`. According to SIP-11 (String Interpolation) the standard interpolation should replace every escape character sequence by the denoted character, therefore I expected a result of length 3.
```scala
scala> s"a\nb"
res0: String =
a\nb
b

scala> res0.length
res1: Int = 6
```
