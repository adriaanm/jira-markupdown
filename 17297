This bug started when MethodTFA was refactored to contain both {{interpret()}} and {{mutatingInterpret()}}, and I forgot to override the latter in the subclass in {{resolveDups()}}.

Without this patch 
  https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/1043
ICodeReader doesn't load bytecode for some Java-compiled class files (those containing DUP_X-style instructions).
