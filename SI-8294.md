Since {{scala}} doesn't seem to have a means to pass in a Scala string to be executed (unlike Python, Ruby, Perl, etc), I was hoping named pipes would do the job, but apparently the script runner is expecting a real file. I don't however think it should be necessary because this is the interpreter not compiler so it doesn't need to emit {{.class}} files side by side with the source file.

Or maybe this is because the {{.scala}} extension is missingâ€”not sure.

{code}
    $ scala <(echo 'println("Hello")')
    java.io.IOException: no such file: /dev/fd/63

Didn't know about the {{-e}} flag, but anyway, named pipes should be transparently supported anyway, it's such a core unix thing, although I'm not suggesting many people actually rely on this behavior.
