Replying to [comment:4 malayeri]:
Ok, didn't know about that. But isn't my solution simpler and more scalaesque, by allowing extending syntax, instead of low-level 'hooks' as it's described in the newsgroup. I also don't see so much difference between a function call and a constructor invocation, the latter perhaps just being a special case of the first.
People won't be 'misusing' this expressibility that much I think.
And although indeed this is currently my only use-case, with some time new ones might come up. (Do we need another annotation/hook then?) But yes, in any case I'm happy that my actual problem is probably solved in 2.9 :-)
