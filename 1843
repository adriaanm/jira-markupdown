I think I'm running into a similar issue. I'm trying to create a simple class:
```scala
class Topping(var name:String)}}
```

That class definition should create the implicit getter and setter for its name attribute. Then, I create a trait this way:
```scala
trait LoggingNameTrait extends Topping {

  override def name_=(aName:String) {
    print(aName)
    super.name_=(aName) // this line doesn't compile
  }

}
```

The Scala compiler doesn't let me trait-overwrite the setter for the name attribute. Is this supposed to work this way (some kind of a language limitation)?
