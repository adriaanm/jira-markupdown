It is likely there is a measurable impact in environments making heavier use of implicit search than the compiler does.  I say this because the optimization originated with tiark attacking their compile times, and if he shipped it then the smart money is that it was motivated.

It would be really good if we were collecting regular timings for compiling not-the-compiler things though, as the assessment above is a little inaccessible to everyone but me.
