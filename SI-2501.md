Based on examples such as scala.collection.generic.Addable,
synchronizedBuffer perhaps needs an extra type parameter

{code}
ArrayBuffer[A]
def +(elem: A): ArrayBuffer[A]
def +=:(elem: A): this.type
override def ++=:(iter: Traversable[A]): this.type
override def clone(): ArrayBuffer[A]

SynchronizedBuffer[A] // should perhaps be [A, +This <: Buffer[A]]
def +(elem: A): Buffer[A] // should perhaps return This
def +=:(elem: A): Buffer[A] // should perhaps return this.type
def ++=:(iter: Traversable[A]): Buffer[A] // should perhaps return this.type
clone(): Buffer[A] // should perhaps return This
{code}
Note I haven't tested this suggestion.

A possible variation on my earlier suggestion for synchronizedBuffer:-

def +(elem: A) could have return type  this.type :-

{code}
  override def +(elem: A): this.type = synchronized[this.type] {
    super.+(elem)
    this
  }
{code}

Note that synchronizedSet.clone causes similar problems to synchronizedBuffer, and should perhaps be defined:-

{code}
trait SynchronizedSet[A, +This <: Set[A]] extends ...
    override def clone(): This = ...
{code}

synchronizedMap also has problems, seen when compiling
{code}
    new OpenHashMap[String, Boolean] with SynchronizedMap[String, Boolean]
    new WeakHashMap[String, Boolean] with SynchronizedMap[String, Boolean]
{code}

openHashMap
def iterator = new Iterator[(Key, Value)]{ ... }

can become
def iterator: Iterator[(Key, Value)] = new Iterator[(Key, Value)]{ ... }


javaConversions.jMapWrapper
def iterator = new Iterator[(A, B)] {

can become
def iterator: Iterator[(A, B)] = new Iterator[(A, B)] {
