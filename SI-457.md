With 2.7.0-RC1, this code doesn't compile:

```scala
object Test {
  def foo(x : Any) = x match {
    case y => { System.out.println(y.getClass()) }
  }
}
```

It generates this error:

```scala
error: type mismatch;
 found   : Any
 required: ?{val getClass: ?}
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method any2stringadd in object Predef of type (Any)scala.runtime.StringAdd and method any2ArrowAssoc in object Predef of type [A](A)ArrowAssoc[A]
 are possible conversion functions from Any to ?{val getClass: ?}
    case y => { System.out.println(y.getClass()) }
```

One doesn't except this type of message for a getClass() call.

You would end up writing code like this:

```scala
object Test extends Application {
  def foo(x : Any) = x match {
    case y : AnyRef => { System.out.println(y.getClass()) }
    case z => { System.out.println("What am I? " + z) }
  }
  foo("ddd")
  foo(10)
  foo(null)
}
```

But besides null, what would z ever match?

It seems that I should be able to do a getClass() on anything and the compiler
would do autoboxing for me.
I ran into this same problem. It must be possible to call getClass() on Any, and get a valid result for both reference and value types. It works in java, and it is needed quite often, whenever types need to be handled at runtime. Anyone have a solution?

As this is a duplicate of #864 which has been closed wontfix, #457 now joins his brother in the graveyard.  BTW I assume the reporter knows by now, but for any future trac sifters, you can cast Any to AnyRef and then call getClass, and that will do what I think most people want out of Any.getClass.
