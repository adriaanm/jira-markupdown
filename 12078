I realize that on the JVM, {{ArrayBuilder}} has var fields. Some of my earlier comment might make sense only if you consider the completely different implementation of {{ArrayBuilder}} that is used in Scala.js: https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/master/scalalib/overrides/scala/collection/mutable/ArrayBuilder.scala#L32-L73
