Ha ha, did you see my old comment in TransMatcher, at the one place where caseIsOk is used?
```scala
// this appears to be an attempt at optimizing when all case defs are constructor
// patterns, but I don't think it's correct.
def doApply(fn: Tree): Boolean =
  (fn.symbol eq (selector.tpe.decls lookup nme.CONSTRUCTOR)) &&
  (cases forall caseIsOk)
```
