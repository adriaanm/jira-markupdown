"Broken" is what it was before.  You left the last line off your old behavior transcript:
{code}
scala> xml == x2
res1: Boolean = false
{code}
As far as I'm concerned, if we're stuck with this idea of "universal" equality and one == method which takes an Any, then the absolute minimum requirement for the standard library is that it not be internally inconsistent.  That way people who want an inconsistent equals can implement it on top of a consistent one; however there is no way to implement a consistent one on top of an inconsistent one.

As mentioned elsewhere the old behavior is still available in xml_==.
{code}
scala> x2 xml_== xml
res0: Boolean = true

scala> xml xml_== x2
res1: Boolean = false
{code}
So to the extent I have anything to say about it, this is wontfix.
