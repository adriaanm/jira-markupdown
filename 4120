Closing as the problems with trait forwarders and static forwarders has been fixed in 2.11.0, by emitting weaker signatures if the exact one won't be coherent with the erasure.

I'm hopeful we'll find a more refined approach in the future. I've outlined the ideas for that: scala/bug#8293

If I have missed any residual signature issues that weren't related to forwarders, please open a new ticket and link it to this one.
