The signatures were broken in r17396.  Until then trackSetInfo's signature looked like this:
{code}
<T:Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Symbols$$Symbol;>(TT;Lscala/tools/nsc/symtab/Types$$Type;)TT;
{code}
It looks like info has to be used more carefully? I'm adding iulian to the cc: since he has the best chance of knowing how to remedy this in short order.
