I am encountering an issue with implicit conversion in a development of polynomial arithmetic for a computer algebra project. Here is a simplified case that shows the problem:
{code}
trait Ring[T <: Ring[T]] {
  def +(that: T): T
  def *(that: T): T
}

class A extends Ring[A] {
  def +(that: A) = new A
  def *(that: A) = new A
}

class Poly[C <: Ring[C]](val c: C) extends Ring[Poly[C]] {
  def +(that: Poly[C]) = new Poly(this.c+that.c)
  def *(that: Poly[C]) = new Poly(this.c*that.c)
}

implicit def coef2poly[C <: Ring[C]](c: C) = new Poly(c)

val a = new A
val x = new Poly(new A)

x+a // works
a+x // works

val y = new Poly(new Poly(new A))

x+y*x // works
x*y+x // works
y*x+x // works

x+x*y
{code}
{code}
<console>:16: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Poly[Poly[A]]
 required: Poly[A]
       ret(0) = x+x*y
                    ^
{code}
Is there a chance that it might be corrected at a given point in time ?

The problem occurs in a much simpler situation:
{code}
class A {
  def +(that: A) = new A
  def *(that: A) = new A
}

class B {
  def +(that: B) = new B
  def *(that: B) = new B
}

implicit def a2b(a: A) = new B

val a = new A
val b = new B

a+b*a // works
a*b+a // works
b*a+a // works

a+a*b

<console>:58: error: type mismatch;
 found   : B
 required: A
       ret(0) = a+a*b
                    ^
{code}
By the way this is in version 2.7.3.final.

I have found a workaround:
{code}
class A {
  def +(that: Nothing) = () // I'm just adding this overloaded method...
  def +(that: A) = new A
  def *(that: A) = new A
}

class B {
  def +(that: B) = new B
  def *(that: B) = new B
}

implicit def a2b(a: A) = new B

val a = new A
val b = new B

a+b*a // works
a*b+a // works
b*a+a // works

a+a*b // ... and then it works.
{code}

I am quoting part of the discussion in the Scala user mailing list on 2008/03/05 before I filled this bug report, which may be related and of interest:

Here is what the manual says (ScalaReference.pdf , p101):

"Views are applied in two situations.

   1. If an expression e is of type T , and T does not conform to the
expression's expected type pt. In this case an implicit v is searched
which is applicable to e and whose result type conforms to pt. The
search proceeds as in the case of implicit parameters, where the
implicit scope is the one of T => pt. If such a view is found, the
expression e is converted to v (e).

   2. In a selection e.m with e of type T, if the selector m does not
denote a member of T. In this case, a view v is searched which is
applicable to e and whose result contains a member named m. The search
proceeds as in the case of implicit parameters, where the implicit scope
is the one of T. If such a view is found, the selection e.m is converted
to v(e).m."

I understand 2. as saying that argument types are not relevant and that
the name only is searched for. But this is in contradiction with the facts:

class A {
  def +(that: A) = new A
}

class B {
  def +(that: B) = new B
}

implicit def a2b(a: A) = new B

val a = new A
val b = new B

b+a // works, this one is normal according to 1. above

a+b // works too !!!

Having found the + method of A, the compiler should have stopped
researching a replacement type for a, and not have applied the required
conversion a2b(a)+b.

This fails however when A and B need to be converted to a third type C
for the operation to be possible:

class A {
  def +(that: A) = new A
}

class B {
  def +(that: B) = new B
}

class C {
  def +(that: C) = new C
}

implicit def a2c(a: A) = new C
implicit def b2c(b: B) = new C

val a = new A
val b = new B

a+b // fails

If I remove the + method in A, then it works and yields a2c(a)+b2c(b).
So the + in A is what stops the search process.
