The following program uses the "pimp my library" pattern to add a toThe method to the Double class:

import Implicits._

object Implicits {
  implicit def doubleExt(d1 : Double) = new {
    def toThe(d2 : Double) : Double = java.lang.Math.pow(d1, d2)
  }
}

object javaImplicitsTest {
  def main(args: Array[String]) = {
    println(2.0.toThe(7.0))
  }
}

Using scalac this compiles and runs fine.

If you try to compile the same program (with the java.lang.Math.pow library calls changed to System.Math.Pow) to MSIL using scalac-net, the compiler prints "error: fatal error: class java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException not found." and does not generate a MSIL file.

If you comment out the call to the toThe method, scalac-net successfully generates MSIL for the anonymous class and the toThe method -- the problem seems to be in calling it.  (If you create a named class to hold the toThe method, scalac-net compiles it okay and it runs fine.)
With the closure of SI-6772, this goes out of scope.
