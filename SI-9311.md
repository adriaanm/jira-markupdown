The following code:

{code}
object Foo {
  /**
   * @throws java.lang.Exception
   */
  def bar = ()
}
{code}

causes scaladoc to emit the following warning:

{code}
[warn] /Users/jroper/tmp/scaladoc-link/Foo.scala:2: Could not find any member to link for "java.lang.Exception".
[warn]   /**
[warn]   ^
[warn] one warning found
{code}

Two problems here:

# The warning shouldn't be emitted, this warning makes it impossible to enabled -Xfatal-warnings
# The line of code that its reported on is off by one
as an alternative to disabling {{-Xfatal-warnings}} (I hope you were disabling it for Scaladoc generation only, and not for your entire build?), you can use {{-no-link-warnings}} to prevent these warnings from being emitted
it looks to me like this ticket should be closed as "not a bug". the link warnings can be disabled with {{-no-link-warnings}}, and if you don't want to disable them, you can use {{-doc-external-doc}} to make the links work. the regex gunk in the SO answers being needed seems like a bug, but that would be a different ticket.

James, I'm guessing you just didn't know about the existence of these Scaladoc options — neither did until I investigated just now.

the off-by-one-line problem seems like a bug as well, but that seems like it should be a different ticket, too.

[~ureche] [~gourlaysama] what do you think?
As a general suggestion, I would just write:

{code}
object Foo {
  @throws[Exception]
  def bar = ()
}
{code}

This way the information also ends up in the class file.

I don't think so - in an effort to improve the quality of the Play API documentation, I'd really like to enable both {{-Xfatal-warnings}} and link warnings - we have a lot of bad links in our scaladocs, which is really bad and also a really easy mistake to make, the only realistic way to protect against this, especially in an open source project with hundreds of contributors, is to fail the build when bad links are encountered.

The {{doc-external-doc}} option is really cumbersome - especially for Java API docs, as the link in SO shows.  It's also a problem if you want to document an exception being thrown from a library that doesn't publish its API docs anywhere.  Whatever you provide as the URL will simply be wrong, so you're faced with a choice between two bad situations, API documentation with dead links in it, or no validation which inevitably means API documentation with dead links in it.

Putting the exception in the throws clause of the classfile is not an alternative - the purpose of documenting exceptions in the scaladoc is to explain why and under which circumstances the exception will be thrown, this is not possible to do if using the {{@throws}} annotation.  The {{@throws}} annotation should be in addition to the {{@throws}} scaladoc, not instead of.

I see two possible solutions to this:

# Make the auto linking of exceptions optional, and make it possible to explicitly link the exceptions.  So then, the developer chooses if they want the exception linked, if they say {{@throws [[SomeException]]}}, it will be linked, otherwise it won't.
# Only auto link exceptions if it's possible to generate a link for them.

The second makes more sense to me.  Furthermore, perhaps it could be handled in such a way that the exception would still be type checked - this would protect against typos, which is important, so a warning would be output if it didn't typecheck, but then if it did typecheck, but no link could be generated, it should be silent.
